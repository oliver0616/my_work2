Dr. Gudivada provided these follow information:
_index
An index is like a database in a relational database. In fact, index is just a logical namespace that groups together one
or more shards (this is an internal detail).
 
_type
We use the same type for documents that represent the same class of thing, because they share the same data structure.
 
Every type has its own mapping or schema definition, which defines the data structure for documents of that type, much like the columns in a database table.
 
Mapping for the type tells Elasticsearch how the data in each document should be indexed.
 
_id
When creating a new document, you can either provide your own id or let Elasticsearch generate one for you.
 
Index, type, and id uniquely identify a document.
 
Every document has a version number. Every time a change is made to a document (including deleting it), the _version number is incremented.
 
Autogenerating IDs: use POST verb, instead of PUT. Autogenerated IDs are 22 character long, URL-safe, Base-64-encoded string universally unique identifiers, or UUIDs.
 
Retrieving Part of a Document
 
Individual fields can be requested by using the _source parameter. Multiple fields can be specified in a comma-separated list.
 
Mapping -- How the data in each field is interpreted
Analysis -- How full text is processed to make it searchable
Query DSL -- The flexible, powerful query language used by Elasticsearch
 
When you index a document, Elasticsearch takes the string values of all of its fields and concatenates them into one big string, which it indexes as the special _all field.
 
This process of tokenization and normalization is called analysis, which we discuss in the next section.
 
Tokenizing a block of text into individual terms suitable for use in an inverted index; normalizing these terms into a standard form to improve their searchability, or recall.
 
Elasticsearch also ships with prepackaged analyzers -- Standard analyzer, Simple analyzer, Whitespace analyzer.
 
Elasticsearch needs to know what type of data each field contains. This information is contained in the mapping.
 
Each document in an index has a type. Every type has its own mapping, or schema definition. A mapping defines the fields within a type, the datatype for each field, and how the field should be handled by Elasticsearch.
 
We can view the mapping that Elasticsearch has for one or more types in one or more indices by using the /_mapping endpoint
