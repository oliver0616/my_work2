ABSTRACT 
Tertiary institutions are increasing the emphasis on generating, 
collecting and analyzing student data as a means of targeting 
student support services. This study utilizes a data set from a 
regional Australian university to conduct logistic regression 
analyzing the student enrollment outcomes. The results indicate 
that demographic factors have a minor effect while institutional 
and learning environment variables play a more significant role in 
determining student enrollment outcomes. Using grade 
distribution compared to grade point average provides better 
estimates as to the effect particular grades have on enrollment 
outcomes. Moreover, the effect of an early alert system on 
enrollment outcomes shows that early identification has a 
significant relationship to a student’s choice to stay enrolled 
versus discontinuing, lapsing or being inactive in their enrollment. 
These results are vital in the targeting of student support services 
at the case study institution. The significant results indicate the 
importance of learning environment variables in understanding 
student enrollment outcomes at tertiary institutions. This analysis 
forms part of a much larger research project analyzing student 
retention at the institution.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Big data has enabled universities to collect detailed information 
on student activities beyond enrollment information systems. 
Many institutions are now moving to analyze data on student 
learning behavior to better understand their student cohorts and 
provide targeted student support. Evaluating the effectiveness of 
early alert systems to identify students in need of support is an 
important step in the development of such systems. This study 
uses data obtained from an Australian regional university between 
2011 and 2014 to conduct a case study analysis of enrollment 
outcomes, using a sample of 9482 students. The study uses a 
multinomial logistic model to estimate the likelihood of various 
enrollment outcomes. The model includes data obtained from an 
early alert system (EAS) used to identify students at risk of 
disengaging from their studies. This allows statistical inference on 
the effect an EAS has on enrollment outcomes. 

2. PREVIOUS STUDIES 
Tertiary institutions have increased their focus on early 
identification of students in need of support, targeting of support 
services and understanding student enrollment patterns [1; 2; 4; 9; 
12]. This has resulted in a multitude of both in-house and 
commercial information systems used to target student support [3; 
5; 6]. The significance of the effect these systems have on student 
learning and education outcomes is an ongoing debate with some 
researchers finding significant results[4] whilst other researchers 
are more skeptical about the conclusions reached [11]. This 
preliminary analysis contributes to this area of research indicating 
that the likelihood of student outcomes can be estimated factoring 
in the effect of an EAS. 

3. METHODOLOGY 
The multinomial logit model estimates the likelihood of the 
enrollment outcomes in order to examine the factors affecting the 
enrollment status of students. This method has been used 
previously in multiple studies [7; 8; 10; 13] to understand various 
aspects of EASs and student retention in tertiary institutions. The 
dependent variable for this study is the enrollment status of the 
student which can be broken up into five categories, enrolled, 
completed, discounted, lapsed or inactive. The lapsed and inactive 
enrollment outcomes are different definitions used to designate 
students who fail to enroll in units as a part of their course.

These are somewhat analogous to stop-outs however they can 
capture students who dropout who fail to inform the university of 
their decision to drop out, being indefinitely inactive or lapsed. 
A number of explanatory variables were used to account for the 
demographic, institutional and learning environment factors. The 
demographic variables are age at commencement of study, and 
dummy variables for gender and Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait 
islander status (ATSI). The institutional variables are variables 
which stay static during a student’s enrollment at the institution, 
which includes fee category, the completion of previous studies, 
study mode (internal or external) by residence, and the type of 
course students undertook. The learning environment variables 
included the grade distribution of the student, the level of 
workload undertaken measured by the average number of units 
per teaching period and finally the number of times the student 
was identified by an early alert system (EAS).  
The case study university internally developed and initiated an 
EAS in 2011 to identify students at risk of disengaging from their 
studies. The EAS uses 34 weighted triggers to rank students daily 
on criteria such as online resource usage, levels of past and 
current unit attrition, previous academic failure and level of 
“happiness” they feel towards units using student feedback tools. 
This ongoing project aims to form the basis of targeted support to 
students. In the context of modelling, this variable just captures 
the number of times the student was identified as being at risk of 
disengagement; it does not capture the nature or quantity of 
support the student received once identified. The use of this 
variable provides significant insight into possible effects such a 
program has on enrollment outcomes without the need to factor in 
the complex nature of student support itself. 

4. RESULTS 
These results are part of a much larger research project on student 
retention at the institution. Using 9482 observations, the 
multinomial logistic regression obtained an LR ?2 value of 
10032.65, a p-value approaching 0 and a pseudo R2 of 0.3469. 
This indicates a highly statistically significant multinomial model.  
Tables 1-3 present the results of the multinomial logistic 
regression with estimated relative risk ratios, which indicate the 
likelihood of the event compared to the base case. The base case 
was arbitrarily selected for modelling with each variable 
indicating the proportion of the overall sample from 9482 
students. For this case study the base case was male (34%) off-
campus online student (61%) currently enrolled in a bachelor 
degree through traditional student intake (83%). This student is a 
domestic higher education loan program (HELP) student (96%) 
meaning they have an Australian government backed deferred 
debt to pay for their tuition fees. The student is not identified as 

being at risk of disengaging from their studies during the 3-year 
data capture period (22%). 

4.1 Demographics 
Results for demographics show gender and age are significant in 
some categories, whilst Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander 
was not significant, which may be due to limited students in this 
category.  

4.1.1 Gender 
Gender was a significant factor when comparing completed to 
enrolled students and when comparing discontinued to enrolled 
students. The model estimates that female students are 1.2 times 
more likely to have completed their qualification compared to 
their male counterparts holding all other variables constant. This 
result was only significant at the 10% level. Females were 1.25 
times more likely to have discontinued their studies when 
compared to males and this was significant at the 1% level. The 
age profile of the institution is that a significant number of 
students are older, female, studying online, and off-campus. This 
result captures the situation where female students are more likely 
to discontinue their studies than males and indicates that there is 
some gender disadvantage occurring with external environmental 
variables a likely source of this disadvantage. 

4.1.2 Age 
Age at commencement was statistically significant when 
comparing students who completed their studies, and those who 
lapsed, to the base case of enrolled. This relationship is non-linear 
as age squared was also statistically significant. The results show 
that younger students are more likely to complete their studies 
compared to the base case of being enrolled. This is also true for 
the lapsed and intermittent enrollment outcome, indicating that 
younger students are more likely to simply not enroll in any units 
or take an informed break from their studies.  
However since this is a non-linear relationship that changes over 
time, the likelihood of completing or lapsing is at parity when the 
student is 41 and 44 respectively, and then students become less 
likely to complete past 41 but they are also less likely to lapse 
past 44. It is important to note that the magnitude of the likelihood 
estimates of these outcomes is not large, with a range between 
1.0438 down to 0.9458. This means that, whilst it is a significant 
effect, the overall impact of age on any prediction of the 
likelihood of enrollment outcomes will be small.  

4.2 Institution Variables 
4.2.1 Fee Category 
The fee category variable shows significant results for 
international students which is to be expected.

Bachelor (Honors) 9.9515*** 0.6024* 0.5739* 0.6473 

 
Compared to the base case of a domestic HELP student, 
international students are 12.3 times more likely to have 
completed their degree. Two effects explain this; the first is that 
there is a greater emphasis to complete their degree as quickly as 
possible compared to domestic HELP students. The second effect 
is that international students at the case study institution tend to 
attend the university for their final years of study, having already 
completed their first years of study. This means that they are not 
only at the university for a shorter period of time to complete their 
course, but that the students tend to have already proven their 
ability in a tertiary institution and survived the first year of study.  
International students report a higher likelihood of lapsed and 
inactive enrolment. This is an artifact of the data set capture date, 
whereby a larger proportion of international students were 
inactive due to enrolling at the institution but not commencing 
their studies at the time data was collected. 

4.2.2 Prior Study 
Prior study plays a significant role in a student’s enrollment 
outcomes. For students who had completed previous studies had a 
2.66 times greater chance of completing their studies compared to 
those students who had no previous study experience. These 
students also had decreased chances of discontinuing or lapsing 
their enrollment with the odds being 0.77 and 0.75 times as likely 
respectively. This result is in line with expectation of what theory 
would predict to be the case. 

4.2.3 Residential Status 
The base case student is an off-campus online student who has 
limited face-to-face contact with academic staff. Internal students 
are divided into three categories, those who live in a residential 
college, those who don’t live in residential college but attend 
internally and those who have live both in a residential college 
and away from a residential college but remained internal.  
Internal students who attend college have a significantly less 
chance of completing their studies compared to these students, 
with only 0.17 times chance of completing compared to external 
students. However, these students also have a significantly 
decreased chance of discontinuing, lapsing or being inactive, the 
odds of which are 0.35, 0.2 and 0.59 respectively. This possibly 
reflects the nature of living a college where there is a tight-knit 
social network of students. This means that students are more 
likely to persevere though any hardships, which could affect their  

enrollment outcomes. Internal non-college students also have a 
decreased chance of having completed their studies with a 0.554 
times chance of completing versus being enrolled. Like college 
students, they have a significantly decreased chance of lapsed or 
intermittent enrollment outcomes. However, unlike college 
students, non-college internal students have a 1.42 times greater 
chance of being inactive compared to enrolled students. This 
could be due to the lack of that close-knit support network that 
college provides.  
Internal students who have lived in both a residential college and 
away from college have increased chances of all the possible 
enrollment outcomes compared to external enrolled students. 
These students with multi-residential students have a 1.6 times 
greater chance of having completed their studies compared to 
external students. Students who have lived both in college and 
independently away from college are likely to be more mature-
minded students who have taken control of their learning 
environment at some point and either left college, or moved into 
college, which has had a positive effect with respect to the 
chances of completion. However, this change of learning 
environment is also the potential source of increased chances of 
discontinuing, lapsing or being inactive, which are 1.63, 1.43 and 
1.38 times higher respectively. 

4.2.4 Course Type 
The diploma is an undergraduate qualification, which requires the 
student to complete only eight units, which depending on 
workload would take a year full-time. Therefore, the estimated 
chance of completing this type of course is 3.45 times greater than 
the bachelor degree (typically three years). The advanced diploma 
qualification is comprised of twelve units and would take on 
average one and half years fulltime to complete. As such it also 
has an increased chance of being completed at 2.39 times greater 
than the bachelor degree. These results are in line with expected 
outcomes. However, advanced diploma students do have a 
significantly increased chance of lapsing or being inactive in their 
enrollment compared to bachelor students. It is unclear as to why 
this is the case and should be an area of more detailed analysis. 
Bachelor degree students who enter as graduates have already 
completed previous qualifications, so it is no surprise that these 
students have a 2.09 times greater chance of completing their 
qualification, and significantly decreased chances of 
discontinuing and lapsing their enrollment.

Bachelor students enrolled in honors programs are also 
significantly likely to have completed their qualifications, the 
chances being nearly 10 times greater than compared to normal 
bachelor students. This is in line with expectations as honors 
students face higher tertiary entry requirements and need to 
maintain a near distinction grade point average.. 

4.3 Learning Environment Variables 
4.3.1 Grade Distribution 
The grades variable is a discrete count of the number of grades a 
student has attained on their academic record. All estimates of 
these variables are significant at the 1% level and provide a 
more meaningful interpretation than grade point average alone 
as a measure of academic performance. Overall, if a student 
achieves an additional grade, then the student is most likely to 
still be enrolled. This makes logical sense and explains why the 
likelihood estimates for all other categories is less than 1 when 
compared to the base case of enrolled. Since discontinued, 
lapsed and inactive students have ceased their studies, the 
expected result is that they have completed less units than a 
student who is still enrolled, which implies likelihood estimates 
should be less than one. For students who have completed their 
course, this is also the case as those students on average would 
have been undertaken shorter courses (as noted in 4.2.4) 
therefore causing the likelihood estimates of completed students 
versus enrolled to also be below one. Therefore, interpreting the 
grade distribution results relative to the other categories, 
receiving a pass grade, students are more 

likely to end up in the completed category (likelihood of 0.085) 
than they are discontinued (0.56), lapsed (0.57) or inactive 
category (0.79).  This is likewise for credit, distinction and high 
distinction, which is in line with expectation that attaining these 
grades contributed to the progression and eventual completion 
of a course. A student who fails a unit is likely to either 
discontinue (0.83) or become inactive (0.83), whereas a student 
who fails incomplete is likely to end up just inactive (0.92). 
Students who withdraw and withdraw early are least likely to 
complete (likelihood of 0.36, 0.39 respectively) and more likely 
to be inactive (likelihood of 0.87 and 0.865 respectively). The 
results indicate that the inactive enrollment outcome is the next 

most likely outcome after enrolled when receiving a non-
progressing grade.  

4.3.2 Workload 
The workload variable is the average number of units a student 
undertook per teaching period enrolled. This continuous variable 
is interpreted as a one unit increase in average workload. By 
increasing the average number of units undertaken each teaching 
period, the likelihood of completing is 8.24 times greater. This 
is logical given that students take on more units, complete 
courses quicker. The likelihood of a student discontinuing or 
lapsing compared to enrolled is 13.72 and 12.3 times greater 
respectively. It is probable this captures the effect of workload 
stress, where taking on additional units places additional 
demands on students, especially for those enrolled externally. 
The likelihood of becoming inactive is 5.23 times greater than 
compared to enrolled. Comparing across categories it is 
plausible that a student is more likely to discontinue or lapse 
than complete with the increase in workload.  

4.3.3 Early Alert System Identification 
Comparisons made for the early alert systems are against the 
base case of, a non-identified enrolled student. Since all 
significant estimates are less than one, this indicates that 
remaining enrolled is the more likely outcome when identified 
by the EAS. Compared to completed students, there is a 
significant likelihood that a student identified by the EAS more 
than 10 times will be enrolled compared to complete. This 
indicates that students frequently identified at being at risk of 
disengaging a less likely to complete their studies. However, a 
student identified by the EAS is also less likely to discontinue 
with the range of likelihood between 0.65 and 0.7. This 
demonstrates that there is some correlation effect between being 
identified by the EAS and the student’s likelihood to discontinue 
their studies. Comparing enrolled to lapsed students; those 
identified more than 10 times show a significant decrease in the 
likelihood of the student lapsing, with estimates of 0.24 and 
0.28. This is also observed in the case of inactive where the 
likelihood of being inactive is 0.38 that of enrolled students 
when identified more than 10 times. The probability of being 
enrolled was calculated for two subsets of students, those 
identified by the EAS and those not identified by the EAS.

The probability density function estimates the effect of the EAS, 
presented in Figure 1. 

 
Figure 1. Probability density function for effects of EAS 

A discernable difference in probability of being enrolled is 
apparent past the bottom 30% of students. The divergence 
between the two groups indicates that students identified by the 
EAS and the subsequent support offered increased the 
probability of being enrolled compared to those students not 
identified by the system. 

5. DISCUSSION 
The results show a highly significant model in this case, 
estimating the probability of four enrollment outcomes of 
completion, discontinuing, lapsing or inactive enrollment 
compared to the base case of the enrolled student. Gender was a 
statistically significant factor for a student faced with the choice 
to discontinue versus enrolled, with females more likely to 
discontinue. Age factored into the choices of completing or 
lapsing versus staying enrolled, with a significant non-linear 
effect. Fee category captured the effects faced by international 
students, who are more likely to complete and least likely to 
discontinue. Comparing external students to internal students in 
various residential settings highlighted the support network 
residential college students have, who are significantly less 
likely to discontinue, lapse or be inactive compared to their 
external counterparts.  
The most significant results of the study is highlighting the 
statistically significant relationship between the institutions 
early alert system, which identifies students at risk of 
disengagement, and the enrollment outcomes. It shows that 
compared to the base case of not identified, the system correctly 
identified students less likely to complete compared to being 
enrolled. The system correctly identified students at risk of 
discontinuing, lapsing or being inactive with these students 
significantly less likely to opt for the negative enrollment 
outcomes. The system provides a valid platform for targeted 
student support services, the benefits of which will be discussed 
in forthcoming research.
