ABSTRACT 
This paper provides an evaluation of the current state of the field 
of learning analytics through analysis of articles and citations 
occurring in the LAK conferences and identified special issue 
journals. The emerging field of learning analytics is at the 
intersection of numerous academic disciplines, and therefore 
draws on a diversity of methodologies, theories and 
underpinning scientific assumptions. Through citation analysis 
and structured mapping we aimed to identify the emergence of 
trends and disciplinary hierarchies that are influencing the 
development of the field to date. The results suggest that there 
is some fragmentation in the major disciplines (computer 
science and education) regarding conference and journal 
representation. The analyses also indicate that the commonly 
cited papers are of a more conceptual nature than empirical 
research reflecting the need for authors to define the learning 
analytics space. An evaluation of the current state of learning 
analytics provides numerous benefits for the development of 
the field, such as a guide for under-represented areas of research 
and to identify the disciplines that may require more strategic and 
targeted support and funding opportunities.

This interest stems from the potential for learning analytics to 
provide new insights and understanding into how students learn 
and how educators and institutions can best support this process. 
However, as noted in the McKinsey report, the strategic 
application of analytics [16] to inform practice has not been 
extensive within the education sector. Simply put, while the 
education sec- tor is data rich it has historically been analytics 
poor. The limited use of analytics in education, apart from the use 
of business intelligence to improve organizational efficiency, is 
clear in several areas. For instance, the lack of access to easy to 
use dashboard and analytics tools for educators and learners and 
the absence of any systemic deployment of learning analytics that 
informs the organization’s learning and teaching practice. 
Arguably this dearth of institutional wide exemplars is in part due 
to the need for analysts and researchers to rapidly demonstrate the 
potential data mining and analytics to improve learning while 
dealing with the complexity of “messy” data and the 
organizational political challenges that arise due to various 
stakeholders and data “owners”. 

The outcome of limited systemic analytics activity is a 
predominance of research that is founded on the extraction of 
readily available data such as those drawn from learning 
management systems (LMS), student information systems (SIS), 
and basic demographics and student grades. Thus, the research 
questions have tended to centre on identifying key variables that 
inform student retention and academic performance. However, 
these commonly bivariate analyses are the “low hanging fruit” 
in terms of the overall potential for analytics to redefine and 
shape education praxis. The goal here is not to condemn prior 
analytics work to the sidelines of research but to note that the 
learning analytics landscape is complex, shrouded in the morass 
of social, technical, and cultural problems that pervade the 
education sector. While LMS and SIS data can provide insight 
into how to improve teaching and learning, this level of focus is 
not suitably aligned with the substantial challenges that face all 
levels of education – many of which require a systemic and 
integrated response. For example, while it is helpful to note that 
students who regularly log into a LMS may perform better than 
their less active peers, this information is not suitable for 
developing a focused response to poor performing students. It is 
neither helpful nor productive to simply tell under-performing 
students to log in more frequently. Despite the current 
limitations, much credit must be given to the early analytics work 
for rapidly advancing the profile of learning analytics and raising 
awareness about the value of educational data among a diverse 
set of stakeholders such as researchers, senior education 
administrators, government, industry, and funding bodies. LMS 
or SIS data can be a useful proxy for seeing a part of a problem, 
but it is insufficient to serve as a model for intervention that is  

 231



based on the current state of learning sciences [ 1 ] . Learning 
analytics to date has served to identify a condition, but has not 
advanced to deal with the  learning challenges in a more 
nuanced and integrated manner. 

This paper is an evaluation of the current state of the field of 
learning analytics through the analysis of articles and citations. 
Literature in learning analytics under the broad umbrella of the 
Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) and Learning 
Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conference now spans four 
years. A growing diversity of disciplinary approaches is evident 
in analytics literature, reflecting a field at the intersection of 
numerous academic disciplines. For instance, the field draws on 
assorted theory and methodologies from disciplines as diverse 
as education, psychology, philosophy, sociology, linguistics, 
learning sciences, statistics, machine learning/artificial 
intelligence and computer science. As the learning analytics 
field further evolves and matures it is important to reflect on 
the diversity of disciplines and methodologies that have 
contributed to the current state of learning analytics research. In 
so doing, there is a need to identify the emergence of trends and 
disciplinary hierarchies that may influence the future direction of 
the field. 

An evaluation of the current state of learning analytics provides 
numerous benefits for the development of the field, including: 

? a foundation for future research through the 
acknowledgement of past research activities; 

? assistance for grant-making agencies by identifying promising 
research areas that align with regional and national education 
goals; 

? identify disciplines that are under-represented and require 
more strategic and targeted support and funding opportunities; 

? identify gaps in research for researchers and students; and 
? improve the integration between theory and practice by 

identifying connections between researchers and papers. 

This raises questions relating to the future impact and direction of 
learning analytics and how more granular and nuanced analytics 
activities can be deployed to facilitate uptake and application 
among an expanded set of stakeholders (e.g. research, government 
bodies, education administrators, technology support, and 
faculty). To address these questions this paper explores 
through the lens of structured mapping and citation networks the 
research domains and relationships that have extensively 
contributed to the field to date. An investigation of the patterns 
that evolve from citation networks can indicate the emergence 
of new inter- disciplinary research and methodological clusters 
alongside the identification of the more established and 
mature sub-communities. In undertaking a mapping and review 
of the collaborations that have evolved in the field, researchers 
and practitioners can identify the cliques and sub-culture that 
define the broader learning analytics community. As the 2014 
LAK conference theme suggests, “learning analytics at the 
cross roads,” this is an ideal time to reflect and to assess if the 
field is moving to this intersection of research (and research 
disciplines) with learning theory and practice. 

 
2. CITATION AND AUTHOR NETWORKS 
BRIEF OVERVIEW 
The development and evolution of a scientific discipline can be 
considered as a complex system. As new knowledge is generated 
it is influenced by a wide and inter-related set of factors such as 
peer review processes, ethics, other closely aligned research  

disciplines and priorities in government funding to name but a 
few. Recently, the quantity and quality of the research activity 
within a discipline has been subject to a variety of measures to 
determine the overall impact and hence societal value. For 
example, as part of the research quality framework, the 
Australian government introduced the Excellence in Research for 
Australia as a process to assess the overall quality of university 
based research. Citation profiles and analyses are central 
measures adopted in these practices in order to determine 
research impact. This is founded on the basic notion that a core 
product of any research is the publication of scientific papers in 
journals and conferences. As the products of this research 
(papers) are developed they build upon and therefore cite other 
related and aligned research. Although there is much 
subjectivity regarding an individual’s motivation to cite a 
particular author [6], pragmatically citation counts continue to be 
used as a proxy of impact. The core of the debate over the validity 
of citation analysis relates to the lack of assessment of the quality 
of the paper. As Waltman et al., [20] argued, highly cited 
papers are not always indicative of impactful research. However, 
as the authors further noted, on average this premise does tend 
to hold true. As such, it is reasonable to assume that high citation 
rates do reflect a certain level of quality [23]. 

Although there has been an increase in the use of citation and 
author analytics for quality assurance processes and 
benchmarking, these forms of analytics have long been adopted 
measures to indicate an author’s or publication’s relative 
influence and prominence within a research network [12]. In the 
late 1920’s Gross and Gross [11] simply listed the citations 
made in the Journal of the American Chemical Society as a 
method to inform the strategic allocation of resources for journal 
acquisition in a library, specifically for the chemistry discipline. 
The conclusions drawn from this work can be seen to be an 
early process for determining the impact of an overall journal. In 
the 1950’s Garfield’s [8] ground-breaking work laid the 
foundation for contemporary work in citation analysis. Garfield 
established the “Science Citation Index” – a large and multi-
disciplinary database now accessible via the “web of science”. 

Current citation databases such as Elsevier’s Scopus, Google 
Scholar, web of science and others have made the extraction of 
co-citations and identification of co-author networks more 
accessible. As such, the development of citation networks have 
been adopted to identify disciplinary cliques or what Tight [19] 
refers to as the tribes and territories located within a broader 
research network. This data set is formed when for instance, 
Paper A refers to a previously published Paper B. This citation 
process can be seen to establish a tie between actors that 
ultimately forms a network. 

There are multiple approaches to analyze this bibliometric data. 
For example, a network can be established through author to 
author ties or via direct citation. Co-authorship networks are 
generally adopted to provide an overview of the key contributors 
within a particular field. Collectively, authorship and citation 
analyses identify the distribution and accumulation of capital that 
develops as a research field evolves. Examination of these forms 
of capital can provide insight into the emergence of disciplinary 
hierarchies. Our aim for this paper is to provide a mapping of 
the learning analytics research community to identify the: 

? prominent papers referred to in the research; 
? dominant disciplines and methodologies adopted in learning 

analytics; and 

232



? diversity of research paper genres that comprise learning 
analytics (e.g., opinion papers, reviews, conceptual, empirical 
research, etc.). 

 
3. METHODS 
This section details the data collection and analysis process under- 
taken in the study. 

3.1 Data Collection 
In this study, we included all papers that were published in the 
first three editions of the International Conference on Learning 
Analytics and Knowledge (LAK 2011, 2012, & 2013) [5 ;  9 ;  
18 ] . The LAK conference was chosen as this is the major 
forum for the field of learning analytics and as such provides a 
solid foundation for examining the influential papers, authors, 
disciplines and methods that comprise learning analytics to date. 
To further compare and supplement this data set we examined 
three special issue journals. We identified three such special 
issues published since the first edition of the LAK conference 
– namely the Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks 
(JALN 2012, vol. 16, no. 3, 2012); Journal of Educational 
Technology & Society (ETS 2012, vol. 15, no. 3, 2012) and the 
American Behavioral Scientist (ABS 2013, vol. 57, no. 10). In 
the following, we refer to these conferences and special issue 
journals as collected papers. A more comprehensive analysis 
comprising the entire collection of journal papers published on 
the topic is extremely complex and would require conducting a 
systematic review [ 1 3 ] . As the goal of our study was to 
provide an initial assessment of the emerging author and citation 
networks the publication sources was restricted to the conference 
and specific special issues occurring in t h e  international 
journals. As such we also recognize that the extraction of authors 
and citations for the current study is an incomplete set of all 
research that has been undertaken within the broad scope of 
learning analytics. As these datasets become more complete we 
will be able to evaluate whether the findings presented here are an 
accurate reflection of the corpus or a result of the early analytic 
models employed and interpretations of this preliminary work. 
From the collected papers, we extracted information on the 
authors of the research and the list of references cited per paper. 
Furthermore, we collected data relating to the home discipline 
for all listed authors of the collected papers. This was 
accomplished by examining the affiliation of the authors 
w i t h in the collected papers (e.g., if a researcher was affiliated 
with a computer science department, we assigned computer 
science as the home discipline for this author). In cases where 
such details were lacking in the collected papers we undertook 
searches through institutional websites, and social networking 
sites such as LinkedIn. Lastly, the methodology employed for 
each submitted paper was determined along with the papers 
genre (e.g., conceptual, empirical, or review papers). 

3.2 Data analysis 
The collected papers and the extracted information were analyzed 
using social network analysis and content analysis. Two social 
networks were established based on the collected information: i) 
author network and ii) citation network. The author network was 
created by including all authors as nodes and creating edges 
between co-authors. For example, if nodes A1, A2, and A3 co-
authored paper A, we created nodes A1, A2, and A3 and 
established the following edges: A1 - A2, A1 - A3, and A2 - A3 
(i.e., the author network was undirected). The citation network 
was formed by extracting the authors of both the collected 
papers and their citations. Edges were created between the  

authors of the collected papers and the authors of their citations. 
For example, if actors A1 and A2 co-authored a paper A, in 
which they cited paper B written by B1, B2, and B3, we created 
five nodes A1, A2, B1, B2, B3. Hence the following directed 
edges in the citation network were established: A1 - B1, A1 - 
B2, A1 - B3, A2 - B1, A2 - B2, A2 - B3. The nodes in the two 
networks were assigned the following attributes: i) home 
discipline, ii) type of research contribution of the co-authored 
papers, and iii) types of research methods used in the studies 
reported (see below for the details about the content analysis and 
the attributes under ii) and iii)). The three networks were analyzed 
using the following well-established measures in social network 
analysis [3; 4; 7; 22]: 

? Degree – the number of edges a node has in a network 
? Closeness – the distance of a node to all other nodes in the 

network; 
? Betweenness – the number of shortest paths between any two 

nodes that pass via a given node; 
? Eigenvector – the measure of influence of a node; 
? Diameter – the maximum eccentricity of any node in a net- 

work; 
? Modularity – a measure of decomposability of the network 

into modular communities. 
? Clustering co-efficient – measure of completeness of the 

neighborhood of a node in a network when applied to a single 
node and is the average value of the clustering coefficients of 
all the nodes in the network. 

All social networking variables were computed using the Gephi 
open source software for social network analysis [2]. As noted 
above content analysis was undertaken to determine two 
important research facets, namely: i) the types of contributions 
that the collected paper offered; and ii) the type of research 
methods adopted in the studies reported within the collected 
papers. For the analysis of the papers based on their 
contribution type, we followed the classification scheme 
commonly adopted in the areas of information systems and 
software technology [10; 17; 24]. The classification included the 
following categories: (1) Evaluation research provides an 
assessment of a particular problem and/or solution in practice 
and is typically based on research methods such as case study or 
field experiments; (2) Validation research investigates and 
proposes a novel technique or a solution that has not been not 
implemented in practice and is typically based on research 
methods such as rigorous analysis, experiments, and simulations; 
(3) Solution proposal is a novel or substantial extension of an 
existing method or technique and usually offers an example 
scenario of the proposal accompanied with a critical analysis of 
pros and cons of the proposal; (4) Conceptual proposal offers a 
new perspective to the phenomena under study and the structure 
of the field through a taxonomy or a conceptual framework; (5) 
Opinion-oriented papers offer positions on certain problems under 
study of broader interest for the field; and (6) Experience reports 
outline insights into the experience accumulated w i t h in 
projects. In addition, we extended this classification with the 
category of panel/workshop paper to be able to be inclusive of 
all categories within the L A K  conference proceedings. 

Analysis of the research methods adopted was undertaken using 
the following coding scheme: (1) qualitative method – indicating 
a well-established qualitative research method such as content 
analysis or grounded theory; (2) quantitative method – referring to 
well-established quantitative research methods such as 
hypothesis testing using statistical tests performed on the data 
collected through surveys, software logs, and social networks; 

 
233



(3) mixed-methods – indicating a combination of qualitative and 
quantitative research methods; and (4) Other – includes papers 
such  a s  reports of analyzed literature, or d i s c u s s i o n  of a 
particular topic or field more generally. 
 

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1 Citation counts and network 
Based on the extraction of the data detailed in the methods section 
above, the following counts of citations were calculated. The 
counts of individual citations are confined to a score of 1 
regardless of how many times an individual paper may actually 
cite a specific publication. For example, reference may be 
made to a specific publication several times within a paper 
however this is weighted the same as an alternate publication 
with only a single mention. Examination of the number of 
citations a publication receives can reveal insight into the types 
and distribution of influential articles. 
Table 1 lists the highest cited papers to date aggregated across the 
LAK conferences and special issue journals. Predictably given the 
stage of learning analytics research, the commonly cited papers 
are largely conceptual and review based. The exceptions being 
Macfadyen and Dawson’s [14] empirical work and Wasserman 
and Faust’s [21] oft cited book on SNA methodology. The 
reference to SNA methods reflects the volume of learning 
analytics re- search incorporating network analyses. The adoption 
of SNA techniques may also be indicative of researchers 
grounding their work in more socially oriented learning theory. 
However, further investigation is required to substantiate this 
claim. The high number of conceptual and review papers are 
indicative of the perceived need for authors to define and explain 
the learning analytics field in order to ground their work. As the 
field further evolves the need to re-establish a common  

understanding and definition of learning analytics will 
presumably decrease. In so doing, future analytics authors will 
increasingly draw upon more foundational and innovative 
empirical work. While direct citation counts are commonly used 
and provide a benchmark for future assessment, a richer more in-
depth analysis is required. For instance, Ding et al., [6] analyzed 
the number of and location within a publication where repeat 
citations occur. The authors argued that in order to determine 
influential papers in a field research should include the assessment 
of the number of re-cites and where these re-citations occur. Our 
future work in this area will seek to include these analyses to 
determine if repeat citations are significantly different in terms of 
identifying the key actors in the learning analytics landscape. 
Table 2 provides an overview of the number and diversity of 
citations across the investigated publications. Calculation of the 
top 20 citations as a percentage of the total indicates this grouping 
only represents a small subset of the network. This finding 
suggests there is a high level of diversity in the references the 
authors are drawing upon. The 20-40 top citations band also 
accounts for a relatively low percentage across all the reviewed 
publication sites. This is to be anticipated given the relative 
immaturity of the LAK conferences and the field in general. As 
previously disparate disciplines are brought into the collective 
learning analytics space there is a re-orientation of discovery of 
the established literature. For example as authors with a 
strong computer science back- ground engage with the 
education literature there is a necessary phase of discovery 
within this domain. As such, the subsequent interpretation and 
application is therefore strongly influenced by this alternate 
home discipline. Other authors with a similar back- ground will 
presumably orient towards their more closely related network 
peers. This clustering effect can be determined in the network 
calculations.

The clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which 
individual nodes in a network group (cluster) together (small 
worlds) [22]. A network clustering coefficient of 1 indicates that 
each node in the neighbourhood is completely connected. 
Conversely a score of 0 would indicate there are no connections. 
Analysis of all citations in the special issue journals revealed a 
moderate average clustering coefficient of 0.46 and a network 
diameter of 5 (Table 3). Calculation of the modularity score 
further indicates a high level of neighbourhood clustering. 
The modularity score [3] in this instance was 0.78 at maximum 
resolution identifying 22 communities (Table 3). Interestingly 
when accounting for all citations made across the LAK confer- 
ences the clustering and modularity measures are very consistent 
with the special issue publications (Table 3).  

However, the network diameter was observed to be greater with 
a score of 10. This suggests a more loosely connected network. 
Figure 1a and 1b illustrate the clustering occurring within the two 
networks, i.e. special issue journals and LAK conferences. 
Figures 1a and 1b also illustrate that the network appears to 
have few highly connected nodes. The degree centrality measure 
can be used to identify the highly cited nodes in the two 
networks. The degree centrality has been frequently used in 
bibliometric analyses to identify highly connected actors in a 
co-citation network. Identification of these nodes reveals 
researchers that tend to bridge both computer science domains and 
education. For ins tance the development of specific tools 
deployed and evaluated in the education space as well as 
educational psychology research using technologies.

4.2 Author network 
Authorship networks can be used to provide indicators of the 
diversity disciplinary backgrounds, and the thematic areas of 
interest associated within a field, in this case, learning 
analytics. For the purposes of this article we created a network, 
where a connection between two authors is established when 
they have a common paper in the investigated publication sites. 
The analysis of all authors represented across the LAK 
conferences demonstrates numerous small cliques with few 
highly interconnected authors. Figure 2 provides a 
representation of the author network for all LAK conferences 
where the majority of papers have 2-3 co-authors. This would 
appear smaller than the authorship profile in natural sciences for 
example where 3 or more are the norm [15]. While this paper 
presents a commencement point for these analyses in the 
learning analytics domain, future work should ideally draw in 
data from citation databases such as Scopus, and Google 
Scholar. This will provide a more complete assessment of the 
disciplinary connections that feed into learning analytics 
research. To this end, analysis of the disciplinary background of 
the authors can also be used to reveal the types of research that 
influences the field. Figure 3 illustrates the dominant

disciplinary background of the authors represented in the LAK 
conferences. Clearly the conference is at present dominated by the 
computer science field representing approximately 51% of all 
authors. Education is also dominant with 40% of all authors 
having a background in this area. Several disciplines that would 
be expected to be prominent in learning analytics are limited their 
in influence to date including: machine learning, artificial 
intelligence, statistics, and data mining. Interestingly, at this stage 
of the learning analytics development there are relatively few 
inter-disciplinary nodes. However, as new researchers enter this 
space, and undertake their PhD and post-doctoral fellowships 
directly in learning analytics there will be a stronger identification 
of the juxtaposition of multiple disciplines and methodologies. 
Arguably, the researchers currently representing the field bring an 
established methodology and mindset influenced by their 
disciplinary theory, past experiences and approaches to research. 
The promotion of more inter-disciplinary teams and t h e  
emergence of new PhD candidates will result in new 
approaches and novel methods to tackle the key learning analytic 
challenges.

Other (Industry, Engineering; Linguistics; or Business) (nodes sized by degree centrality) 

A similar comparison with the special issue journal suggests that 
while the computer science discipline dominates the LAK 
conference the journal publications are more popular for authors 
with an education research background. This finding may well 
reflect the differences in the publication impact viewed by the 
specific disciplines. For instance computer science researchers 
tend to place much value on the conference proceedings – in 
particular the partnership LAK has secured with the Association 
for Computing Machinery digital library (ACM). In contrast 
education researchers place a greater emphasis on journal 
publications - particularly a journal with an established and 
high impact factor. This separation is one of the organizational 
challenges that need to be addressed to avoid a fragmentation of 
the field. That is, how does Society for Learning Analytics 
Research (SOLAR), the major driver of the LAK conference, 
ensure the field does not separate into discipline dominated 
publication sites. Learning analytics is inter-disciplinary research 
and as such the conference proceedings and the newly 
established Journal for Learning Analytics research must provide 
an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to cross the 
boundary lines of their disciplines. 

4.3 Practical implications 
The analysis conducted in this paper can provide an 
understanding for how a field such as learning analytics evolves 
and matures by detailing the emergence of key authors, papers, 
thematics and the types of papers that are currently influencing 
the field. The intent of our analysis is not to offer a road map 
forward in the development of the discipline. Science and 
research can be influenced, but not scripted. As such, structured 
mapping and citation analyses serve primarily to raise 
awareness about the structure and attributes of knowledge in a 
discipline. 
Numerous implications arise from our analysis, including: 

? the development of curriculum in the growing number of 
academic programs that include learning analytics as a topic; 

 

? promotion of under-represented groups and research methods to 
the learning analytics community; 

? fostering the development of empirical work and decreased 
reliance on founding, overview and conceptual papers; and 

? improved connections to sister organizations such as the 
International Educational Data Mining Society. 

 
As indicated in Figure 5, the diversity of research contributions 
and the research method used by the authors across different 
disciplines is broad. It is clear that both the conference and the 
journal special issues are dominated by the lack of conventional 
research methods and that the authors, regardless of the home 
discipline, mainly contribute proposal solutions to the conference. 
They clearly indicate a much higher ‘rigor’ in the use of research 
methods by the researchers from education, who primarily use 
qualitative research methods. This is also corroborated by the 
higher numbers of papers in the category of evaluation research 
by the researchers from the education home discipline. Category 
other is the most common for research methods for the papers 
published in the journals. This category is now dominated by 
computer scientists and educators. This category is characterized 
by either reporting of descriptive statistics of (ad hoc) 
questionnaires, comparison of literature, or description of potential 
usage scenarios without actual data collection or formalization. The 
conference is dominated by proposal solutions authored by 
computer scientists and educators. The second most common 
category are evaluation research papers, which are dominantly 
authored by computer scientists followed by educators, who had al- 
most an equal number of contributions in opinion papers, personal 
experience papers, as well as validation research. The second most 
important category for computer scientists was validation research. 
Again, the most common method for the conference is other – 
which is really not a formal method, but typically an ad hoc write 
up of personal experience, some random statistics and comparison 
with the literature. It is interesting that the conference has more 
dominated by the use of quantitative methods, which probably has 
to do with the higher number of computer scientist.
