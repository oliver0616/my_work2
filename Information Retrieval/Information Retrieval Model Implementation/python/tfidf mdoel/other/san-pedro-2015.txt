ABSTRACT 
Choosing a college major is a major life decision. Interests 
stemming from students’ ability and self-efficacy contribute to 
eventual college major choice. In this paper, we consider the role 
played by student learning, affect and engagement during middle 
school, using data from an educational software system used as 
part of regular schooling. We use predictive analytics to leverage 
automated assessments of student learning and engagement, 
investigating which of these factors are related to a chosen college 
major. For example, we already know that students who game the 
system in middle school mathematics are less likely to major in 
science or technology, but what majors are they more likely to 
select? Using data from 356 college students who used the 
ASSISTments system during their middle school years, we find 
significant differences in student knowledge, performance, and off-
task and gaming behaviors between students who eventually 
choose different college majors.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The interests that drive a student’s choice of college major are 
usually fostered by their early learning experiences. According to 
Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) [7], academic and career 
choices are shaped throughout middle school and high school by 
environmental supports and barriers, where higher levels of interest 

emerge within contexts in which the individual has higher self-
efficacy and outcome expectations; these interests lead to the 
development of intentions or goals for further exposure and 
engagement with the activity [7]. Interests formed during early 
stages mediate relations between high school students’ self-efficacy 
and their college major choice. This self-efficacy, in turn, mediates 
the relations between high school students’ ability and their formed 
interests. This model suggests that deepening students’ ability 
could increase their self-efficacy in that domain, influencing their 
interests and choices in turn. Previous research on academic 
achievement, self-perception, and motivation suggests that these 
factors, which influence career trajectories, may emerge during 
middle school [7, 8]. As such, determining which middle-school 
behaviors are most predictive to a student’s eventual college major 
could help us to identify factors that are still malleable, improving 
the opportunities available to students, particularly those who 
avoid certain careers which may be due to self-efficacy issues.  

In this paper, we connect fine-grained assessments of student 
learning, affect and behavior to the long-term outcome of college 
major choice, examining how these elements relate to each other. 
Similar connections have already been demonstrated. Not only are 
student learning, affect and behavior in middle school classroom 
associated with college enrollment [14], they are also found to be 
associated with a student’s choice of a STEM or Non-STEM major 
[15]. For example, [15] showed that the disengaged behavior of 
gaming the system in middle school indicates that the student is 
less likely to enroll in a STEM major when they go to college, but 
not which (non-STEM) major that behavior was most associated 
with. In this study, we explore these relationships more precisely, 
showing correlations between learning and engagement within 
middle school use of ASSISTments and the selection of specific 
college major categories, across both STEM and non-STEM 
classifications. We conduct this study using data from 356 college 
students who used ASSISTments for middle school mathematics 
for one or more years between 2004 and 2007. We distill measures 
of student learning, affect and engagement, and study whether these 
factors are associated with specific college majors, contributing to 
the further elaboration of career development theory and the 
generation of more actionable predictions about college major.

2. METHODS 
2.1 Data Source: The ASSISTments System 
This study explores student outcomes from their interactions with 
the ASSISTments system [12]. ASSISTments assesses a student’s 
knowledge while assisting them in learning, providing teachers 
with formative assessment of students as the students’ progress in 
their acquisition of specific knowledge components. Within the 
system, each problem maps to one or more cognitive skills. When 
students working on an ASSISTments problem answer correctly, 
they proceed to the next problem. When they answer incorrectly 
(Figure 1), the system scaffolds instruction by dividing the problem 
into component parts, stepping students through each before 
returning them to the original problem (as in Figure 2). Once the 
correct answer to the original question is provided, the student is 
advanced to the next question. Teachers can assign both in-class 
assignments and homework with ASSISTments, which provides 
them with the performance data needed to track misconceptions 
and discuss them in class.

2.2 Data 
2.2.1 College Major Choice Data 
For this study, over 2,500 students who used ASSISTments during 
their middle school mathematics classes in 2004-2007 were invited 
to partake in a survey about their post-high school academic and 
career achievements. These students were drawn from three school 
districts in the Northeastern US. One was a low-performing district 
in a large, urban area, serving large proportions of students who are 
English language learners and/or who are eligible for free or 
reduced-price lunches. The other two districts are from suburban, 
middle-class populations. 

425 students responded to this survey, which asked students to 
specify the degree program(s) they were enrolled in (if any), 
whether they were engaged in full or part-time employment, and 
what their current employment was. Of 425 respondents, 365 
indicated that they were enrolled in a degree program. Majors were 
grouped into eight general classifications provided by The College 
Board [16], and each student in our sample was labeled 
accordingly: Arts & Humanities (ArtsH), Business (Busi), Health 
& Medicine (HealthMed), Interdisciplinary Studies (Inter), Public 
& Social Services (PubSoc), Science, Math & Technology 
(SciMathTech), Social Sciences (SocSci), and Trades & Personal 
Services (TrPerServ). For the purpose of comparing our middle 
school factors to each of these classifications, we removed one 
classification with only 9 students (the “Trades & Personal 
Services”) leaving 356 students in the study.  

2.2.2 Middle School Data from ASSISTments 
Log files of student interactions ASSISTments were obtained for 
these 356 respondents, who generated a total of 311,450 actions by 
answering a total of 160,128 original and scaffolding problems, 
with an average of 450 problems per student. As discussed below, 
previously developed models of knowledge, affect, and behavior [9, 
10] were applied to this data and used as features in our final 
predictive model of college major choice. 

2.3 Computing Student Knowledge, 
Engagement, and Affect 
The features evaluated for each college major group were generated 
using automated detectors of student engagement and learning 
previously developed and validated for ASSISTments. These 
included models of student knowledge, disengagement, and 
educationally-relevant affective states. Information about usage, 
such as the proportion of correct actions and the number of tutor 
actions made by the student – a proxy for overall usage were used 
as features as well. Each of the detectors was applied to every 
action in the data set for these 356 students who used the system, in 
the same fashion as in previous publications. 

2.3.1 Student Knowledge  
Corbett and Anderson’s [5] Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) 
model, a knowledge-estimation model that has been used in a 
number of ITS systems, was applied to the study data set. BKT 
infers students’ latent knowledge from their performance on 
problems involving the same set of skills. Each time a student 
attempts a problem or problem step for the first time, BKT 
recalculates the estimates of that student’s knowledge for the skill 
involved in that problem, and were applied to each of the student’s 
subsequent attempts on that problem.

2.3.2 Affect and Disengaged Behaviors  
To obtain assessments of affect and disengagement, we leveraged 
existing detectors within ASSISTments [10]. Detectors of four 
affective states were utilized: boredom, engaged concentration, 
confusion and frustration. Detectors of three disengaged behaviors 
were also utilized: off-task, gaming, and carelessness. Due to 
results concerning population validity among our affect detectors 
[9], two sets of detectors were used. Data from students who 
attended urban schools were labeled using models optimized for 
students in urban schools [9, 10], and data from students who 
attended suburban schools were labeled using models optimized for 
students in suburban schools [9].   
Except for carelessness (explained in the next section), affect and 
behavior detectors were developed in a two-stage process: first, 
student affect labels were acquired from field observations 
conducted using the BROMP protocol and HART Android app 
which time-stamps each observation (reported in [10]), and then 
those labels were synchronized with the log files generated by 
ASSISTments at the same time. This process resulted in automated 
detectors that can be applied to log files at scale, specifically the 
data set used in this project (action log files for the 356 students). 
Detectors were constructed using only log data from student 
actions within the software occurring at the same time as or before 
the observations. They were applied to our dataset, producing 
confidence values for each construct that was averaged across the 
log data for each student. These confidences were rescaled as in 
[10, 14], in order to correct for bias caused by resampling during 
training. 

2.3.3 Carelessness 
Carelessness is operationalized using contextual slip estimates—
the probability that despite knowing the skill to answer an item, a 
specific incorrect action made by the student for that item is the 
result of slip or carelessness (see [1]). The probability of 
carelessness/slip is assessed contextually and is different for each 
student action depending on the context of the student error, which 
may include speed of the action, and the student’s history of help-
seeking from the tutor. This study uses carelessness models that 
were previously constructed for ASSISTments [10]. 

2.4 Statistical Tests and Modeling 
For each of the constructs assessed through student log files, 
aggregate student-level predictor variables were created by taking 
the average of the predictor feature values for each student. Hence, 
a student has a single assessment for each construct. Preliminary 
analysis revealed that these features were generally not normally 
distributed in each of the college major groups. For this reason, 
non-parametric tests were used to analyze differences between 
different college major groups.  

3. RESULTS 
3.1 Kruskal-Wallis Test 
We first examined the individual effects of each features, testing 
each to determine whether it appears in at least one college major 
group at significantly higher or lower values than are found in the 
other groups. We used the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test to 
evaluate the mean rank for each group. We also used the false 
discovery rate method to adjust the required alpha for significance 
and to reduce the occurrence of false positives, controlling for 
inflation of Type 1 error [3]. We found significant differences for 

gaming the system (?2 = 22.767, p = 0.001, adjusted ? = 0.01), 
student knowledge (?2 = 21.884, p = 0.001, adjusted ? = 0.015), 
correctness (?2 = 25.086, p < 0.001, adjusted ? = 0.005), and 
carelessness (?2 = 16.758, p = 0.010, adjusted ? = 0.02) in at least 
one pair of major groups. Affective states were not significantly 
different between major groups. 
We can determine which major groups are higher and lower for 
these features by conducting multiple pairwise comparisons using 
the Mann-Whitney U test. Tables 1-4 show adjusted p-values of 
comparisons done between pairs of major groups.

In Table 1, students enrolled in Interdisciplinary Studies and Public 
& Social Services majors show lower performance (less 
correctness) in middle school usage of ASSISTments, compared to 
students enrolled in Arts & Humanities or Health & Medicine. 
Additionally, Public & Social Services majors were less correct in 
middle school than Social Sciences majors. On the other hand, 
students in Science, Math & Technology majors show better 
performance than those who major in Business, Interdisciplinary 
Studies, or Public & Social Services, and Social Sciences. This 
complements our results for student knowledge (Table 2), where 
Science, Math & Technology majors showed higher knowledge 
than students who majored in Business, Interdisciplinary Studies or 
Public & Social Services.

Results for gaming the system (Table 3) show that students 
enrolled in the Public & Social Services majors are likely to exhibit 
this behavior at rates significantly higher than those found among 
students in Arts & Humanities, Health & Medicine, Social 
Sciences, and Science, Math & Technology. Students majoring in 
Business, Interdisciplinary Studies and Social Sciences (the groups 
whose gaming behaviors were not significantly lower than Public & 
Social Service majors) were significantly more likely to game than 
students in Science, Math & Technology.

Results for carelessness (Table 4) overlap with findings for 
correctness (Table 1) and knowledge (Table 2). Students enrolled 
in Science, Math & Technology majors showed higher carelessness 
during their middle school use of ASSISTments, compared to 
students enrolled in Business, Interdisciplinary Studies or Public & 
Social Services majors.  

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we applied fine-grained models of student 
knowledge, student affect (boredom, engaged concentration, 
confusion) and behavior (off-task, gaming, slip/carelessness) to 
data from 356 college students who used an educational software in 
mathematics over the course of a year (or more) during their middle 
school. Our results show that success within middle school 
mathematics (indicated by correct answers and high probability of 
knowledge in ASSISTments) is more common in students who 
eventually enroll in Science, Math & Technology majors than in 
Business, Interdisciplinary Studies, Public & Social Services, or 
Social Sciences majors, a finding that aligns with studies that 
conceptualize high achievement as a sign of STEM major readiness 
and enrollment in STEM programs [17].  

The disengaged behavior of gaming the system during middle 
school mathematics is found to be associated more with students 
enrolled in Business, Interdisciplinary Studies, Public & Social 
Services, and Social Sciences, and less with students enrolled in 
Science, Math & Technology. This association is not yet fully 
understood. Previous research has shown that gaming negatively 
impacts learning [4], but it is also a particularly strong indicator of 
disengagement with mathematics, suggesting that students’ lack of 
interest in STEM majors may manifest early. If gaming reduces the 
likelihood of pursuing Science, Math & Technology major because 
it reduces learning, remediation may be relatively easy. Gaming’s 
effects on learning can be successfully remediated through alternate 
opportunities to learn the bypassed material [2]. However, if 
gaming is instead an early indicator of lack of interest in pursuing a 
Science, Math & Technology major, remediation may be more 
difficult, but perhaps not necessary. (The world needs people in a 
range of professions, though one hopes that these gaming 
behaviors will not convey to other domains, as they are just as 
problematic in business or the social sciences as in STEM careers 
[cf. 13].)

These relationships between middle school student behavior and 
learning with eventual college major selection complement current 
understandings of why students who choose to enroll in a particular 
major. Holland’s theory [6] asserts that students make academic 
and career choices compatible with their personality and driven by 
their preferred activities, interests and competencies [6, 11]. 
Business majors are often oriented toward attaining goals through 
leadership or manipulation (enterprising) and enjoy systematic 
ways of performing activities (conventional). Those who are 
inclined towards interpersonal and social environments (social) are 
likely to choose majors in the Social Sciences or Public & Social 
Services. Students who prefer creative endeavors related to 
unstructured activities (artistic) find a fit in Liberal Arts or 
Interdisciplinary Studies. Finally, students who enroll in Science, 
Math & Technology majors are known to prefer practical and 
concrete activities (realistic) that involve knowledge acquisition 
and problem solving (investigative), a claim supported by our 
findings that success with ASSISTments is most likely among 
Science, Math & Technology majors. 

One curious finding in our study is that affective states are not 
strongly predictive of college major choice. This is surprising given 
that affect is predictive of whether students go to college [14], but 
perhaps it is less relevant to domain-specific choices. A possible 
explanation is that student affect may be less relevant for college 
major choice than how students respond to that affect (e.g., whether 
or not boredom triggers disengaged behaviors that reduce learning), 
a hypothesis that is supported by our current results. It is also 
possible that social conditions (e.g., parental or school support) 
provide more varied learning opportunities for the college-bound 
cohort (which could, in turn, impact interest), so that we might be 
better considering affective patterns among the college-bound 
cohort once they get a bit older. Either way, the lack of relationship 
between affect and college major does not suggest that negative 
affect during middle school should not be attended to, as it still 
impacts both learning outcomes and college attendance [10, 14].  

The goal of this paper, however, is not a final prediction, but rather 
an opportunity to understand whether  student behavior is related to 
long-term outcomes (college major selection), providing an 
opportunity for educators to provide informed guidance that helps 
to grow, harness, and sustain student interests, as early as middle 
school.
