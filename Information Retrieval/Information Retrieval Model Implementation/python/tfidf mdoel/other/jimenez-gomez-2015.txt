ABSTRACT
The use of data mining techniques in educational domains
helps to find new knowledge about how students learn and
how to improve the resources management. Using these
techniques for predicting school failure is very useful in order
to carry out actions to avoid drop out. With this purpose,
we try to determine the earliest stage when the quality of the
results allows for clarifying the possibility of school failure.
We process real information from a Spanish high school by
structuring the whole data in incremental datasets, which
represent how students’ academic records grow. Our study
reveals an early and robust detection of the risky cases of
school failure at the end of the first out of four courses.

1. INTRODUCTION
The application of data mining (DM) techniques with infor-
mation produced in educational contexts has originated an
emerging discipline called Educational Data Mining (EDM).

This new perspective consists in the development and appli-
cation of methods to explore educational data, and the use
of techniques that brings a better understanding of students’
behaviour and learning environments [8].

Improving academic performance is among the main tasks
undertaken by the EDM. This task may be separated into
simpler ones like trying to find the keys of dropping-out [1]
or the prediction of academic performance [2]. In turn, these
subtasks are solved with standard, descriptive and predic-
tive, DM techniques at a lower level: association rule mining,
classification, regression or clustering [6].

Regardless of the methods used, most existing EDMworks in
the literature are based on datasets generated in e-learning
environments as LMS (Learning Management System) or
adaptive systems [5], and almost always, related with uni-
versity courses [8]. There are also few studies on the antic-
ipation, or the amount of information needed for a robust
prediction of academic performance. Studies often supple-
ment their data with results of surveys, questionnaires or
information obtained from other sources [2].

With these precedents, the aim of this work is the detection
of school failure in a pre-university stage in order to carry
out actions to avoid drop out. Thus, the degree of anticipa-
tion plays a role of great relevance to face up school failure.
The information considered in this work is exclusively in-
stitutional, courtesy of a Spanish high school, among which
include personal data of students, their academic records
(grades of every subject at every assessment), as well as
their absences.

Given the quarterly frequency with which new data are
obtained, this study aims to resolve how far in advance
you can determine whether a student will pass the course
and, likewise. With this purpose, different datasets have

300



been obtained, representing in an incremental way over time,
each academic record. On these datasets a series of classi-
fication techniques have been applied to determine when it
has reached the trade-off between both a good predictor of
school failure and enough quantum of time to implement
corrective measures.

The results obtained in the experimental study revealed an
early and robust detection of school failure. During the first
year out of four in this educational stage, interesting re-
sults to determine the future students’ success are obtained
and, therefore, there is enough time to take corrective ac-
tion. Thus, it is possible to know what to change and with
who do it. Useful information is provided to improve the
teaching-and-learning process and to optimize human and
material resources. This paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tion 2 presents a description of the problem, which considers
the nature of the information processed, the data selection
and the objectives of the study, Section 3 describes clean-
ing, preparation and anonymization data. The experimental
study is presented in Section 4. Finally, the results obtained
are analysed together with concluding remarks.

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The Andalusia government has stored, for more than a decade,
information generated in schools via Se?neca 1 web applica-
tion. Since then, this application has been gradually ex-
tended by including new features, so it makes usual the
finding of many missing values in previous academic years to
2005. For this reason, only the classes that began the stud-
ies in the courses 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 are really inter-
esting. These groups are composed of students who over-
whelmingly have completed or left this educational stage.
Knowing the final results in advance allows the task of pre-
dicting school failure by supervised learning techniques to be
addressed, such as classification [8], with which it is possible
to obtain interpretable predictive models.

The school under study is located in the province of Co?r-
doba. This is a typical school in terms of number of stu-
dents and teachers, educational offer, and socio-economic
context. The scores obtained under different statistical in-
dicators place it in the Andalusia average.

Management and educational organization may have changed
in some shades during the considered time slot, so this study
makes sense in those robust and general conclusions are not
affected by these changes.

The main factors [4] composing the reality of each student
can be very diverse (see Figure 1). The behaviour of in-
dividual students toward their course and subjects will be
given by factors intrinsic to their person, such as age, sex or
nationality, previous knowledge, experience or background,
skills and handicaps towards a specific field: attention span,
motivation [2] or conveniences to find understanding and in-
terest. However, for all students at the school under study,
only the following data is stored:

portalseneca/

Figure 1: Incidence factors in academic success

• Personal information: name and surname, ID, birth-
date, address, nationality, gender and legal guardians.

• SNE: Special Needs Education. If a student can present
learning difficulties (retardations, disabilities, etc) ed-
ucational psychology and medical reports are stored.
Just as individual significant adjustments in the cur-
riculum.

• Contrary to coexistence behaviour. These represent
incidents committed by students and that should be
considered. Each record contains a description of the
incident, negative behaviour, the applied corrections,
the teacher who admonishes, date and time, and whether
it is an individual or collective warning.

• For each academic year: absences, grades (in the inte-
ger range 1-10), class group, and number of registra-
tions, which indicates whether the student is repeating
academic year.

• Figure 2 shows the flow of the experiment, and specifies
the phases in which the problem has decomposed. The
following sections discuss in detail each of these phases.

3. PREPROCESSING
Preprocessing phase, independent of the task to do a posteri-
ori, includes cleaning and data preparation. Understanding
cleaning as removing noise and inconsistencies; and prepara-
tion as anonymization of available information [6] and treat-
ment of orphan data and missing values.

Usually, data gathered in educational contexts present dis-
crete values, either numerical or categorical. The numerical
values that we have in this case are integer. Meanwhile,
anonymization is essential for achieving a legitimate use of
sensitive information. In Spain, the use of these sources of
information are limited by the necessary protection of pri-
vacy and confidentiality imposed by Law 2. The personal
data have been eliminated and identifiers completely disso-
ciated.

4. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The knowledge discovery for improving academic perfor-
mance [7] can be decomposed into sub-tasks or questions to
answer through the information enclosed in the input data.
The entire dataset can be, a priori, interesting for solving the
problem, and specific preprocessing will depend on the used
technique. In order to get interpretable predictive models,
we have considered the use of classification models to pro-
mote the prediction in both academic year and obtaining
degree at the end of the educational stage. For feature se-
lection, we have used ranking given by Relief method [5], an
instance-based evaluator.

The experimental design has been based on an incremen-
tal dataset (see Figure 3), including, at first step, previous
and timeless data such as gender, age, nationality, etc. This
dataset will grow term after term, stopping when the accu-

Figure 3: Incremental dataset by terms

racy of classifiers obtained does not significantly improved,
achieving enough time for applying corrective actions.

In this way, we have generated seven different datasets cor-
responding with information previously available: Dataset
#1; at first term of first year: Dataset #2; at second term
of first year: Dataset #3; at the end of the first year: Dataset
#4; at first term of second year: Dataset #5; at second term
of second year: Dataset #6; and finally, at the end of the
second year: Dataset #7.

We have chosen WEKA [5] as environment for classifica-
tion task. Ten classic techniques, which address the prob-
lem from different perspectives, have been used and com-
pared. We have selected a Bayesian probabilistic classifier
(NaiveBayes), a support-vector machine (SMO), a neural
network of radial basis function (RBFNetwork), the Multi-
layer Perceptron (MLP), the algorithm of K-nearest neigh-
bours (IBk), techniques based on rules and decision trees
(JRip, OneR, J48 and PART) and a nominal class classifier
based on boosting (AdaBoostM1).

As for the quality measures, we have chosen the percentage
of patterns correctly classified (accuracy) and the Cohen’s
kappa, since they are statistics that evaluate the goodness
of the classifiers and the differences between all datasets for
each algorithm.

5. RESULTS
Tables 1 and 2 present the goodness of the obtained classi-
fiers to solve the task of predicting whether a student will be
graduated. We have conducted several statistical tests [3] in
order to determine, from a statistical point of view, whether
there are significant differences in predicting school failure
in the different specific moments.

Focusing on the results for the accuracy measure (see Ta-
ble 1), the Friedman test gets a value of 7.452, which does
not belong to the critical interval [0, 2.508] for ? = 0.05.
Therefore, it could be determined that, with 95% confidence,

there are significant differences in predicting school failure
in different datasets.

Analysing the rankings obtained for the accuracy measure,
it is verified that the best results were obtained at the end
of first academic year. We have carried out a post-hoc anal-
ysis by using the Wilcoxon test to determine if significant
differences exist between this stage and the remainder. The
results are shown in Table 3. The test revealed that results
obtained at the end of first academic year are statistically
better than those obtained in previous stages, with ? =
0.05. However, we can not demonstrate statistically, that
from this point on there are differences in the prediction of
school failure. Therefore, the best time to predict school
failure is the last assessment of first academic year.

Focusing on Kappa measurement (Table 2), the Friedman
statistic determines, with 95% confidence, that can not be
said the results of the all terms behave similarly. This statis-
tic obtains a value 7,789, not belonging to critical range [0,
2.508] for ? = 0.05.

Similarly to analysis of results for the accuracy measure, the
best ranking is obtained at the end of first academic year.
We have used Wilcoxon test to establish whether there are

significant differences between this moment and the remain-
der (Table 3). This test shows, with 95% confidence, the
results obtained at the end of first academic year are sta-
tistically better than those obtained at any previous time.
Furthermore, results of Wilcoxon test determined that, from
then on, there were no significant differences in the predic-
tion. Thus, we demonstrate the earliest stage to predict
school failure is the last assessment of first academic year,
and subsequent predictions, in detriment of anticipation, not
improve the goodness of classification (see Figure 5).

The required amount of data to solve promoting prediction,
of each academic year individually, does not allow for the
same statistical study, since only two datasets are considered
valid by academic year: the initial data and the results of
the first term assessment. After this moment, the lack of
anticipation makes irrelevant conclusions from a pedagogical
point of view. However, we can obtain valuable rules by
some techniques, and we can discover important information
published and discussed in this section.

Additionally, we can verify that some algorithms reveal in-
terpretable rules (see Figure 4) in which lies the greater rel-
evance of some subjects and their link with the final results.
Communication skills take the most important role, and it

303

is logical, since the lack of reading comprehension or expres-
sion are an important burden when acquiring other knowl-
edge. The fact of students were in the proper grade with
their age is also binding, the students who have repeated an
academic year usually present bigger difficulties when learn-
ing. Early detection of these difficulties, together with the
consequent early action, may be key factors that help to im-
prove academic performance and optimize the management
of available resources.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this work we have carried out a study about the detection
of the earliest moment when a robust prediction of school
failure is feasible. This prediction is aimed at early inter-
vention, in a corrective way, over riskiest students. Thereby
it is possible to make better use of available resources, such
as tutoring, splitting-groups or reinforcements. It is about
closing the cycle, where the new knowledge discovered will
be again reversed on improving the educational system and
will produce data that will be again studied.

The present work is the first experimental study about a high
school in Spain, so it is susceptible to many extensions, such
as the volume of data treated, considering other secondary
schools, or making wider the set of techniques used on these

data. In subsequent work, we intend to apply descriptive
techniques for a deeper analysis with the overall purpose
of bringing better understand students and their learning
environments.
