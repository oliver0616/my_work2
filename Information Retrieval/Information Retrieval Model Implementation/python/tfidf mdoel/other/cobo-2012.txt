ABSTRACT 
Online discussion forums are a key element in virtual learning 

environments. The way learners participate in discussion boards 

can be a very useful source of indicators for teachers to facilitate 

their tasks. The use of a two-stage analysis strategy based on an 

agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed in 

this paper to identify different participation profiles adopted by 

learners in online discussion forums. Different parameters are 

used to characterize learners’ activity (amount of posts, rhythm, 

depth of threads, crossed replies, etc). Participation profiles are 

identified and analyzed in terms of behavior and performance.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Online discussion forums (or boards) are one of the most 

common tools in web-based teaching-learning environments. 

Online learner participation has been defined as a complex and 

intrinsic part of online learning [6]. In fact, a high level of 

interaction is desirable and increases the effectiveness of 

distance education courses [5]. Thus, discussion boards can be a 

relevant source of information in order to provide teachers with 

useful indicators of learners’ activity and to facilitate their 

monitoring, guidance and feedback tasks. 

The purpose of the present work is to present a two-stage 

analysis strategy in order to model and identify learners’ 

participation profiles in online discussion forums. Since 

clustering learners has proved to be a proper way to find similar 

learning behaviors [11], learners with similar activity patterns 

are clustered together in the first stage and resultant clusters are 

combined in the second stage to identify participation profiles. 

This paper is structured as follows. The working framework is 

introduced in Section 2; the clustering algorithm used in the 

experiments is proposed in Section 3; the data set is described in 

Section 4; the modeling strategy to identify participation profiles 

and the obtained results are shown in Section 5; and, finally, 

conclusions and future work are presented in Section 6. 

2. WORKING FRAMEWORK 
Relevant contributions can be found in literature on modeling 

learner behavior in online asynchronous environments. [1] deals 

with identification of lurkers (in a discussion board, a lurker is 

the one who reads but never writes). This kind of behavior 

makes impossible a visible and active interaction both with other 

learners and teacher in virtual environments. In order to 

investigate lurking, [8] carried out a study on lurking using in-

depth semi-structured interviews with members of online groups. 

The analysis reveals that lurking is a strategic activity involving 

more than just reading posts and a model to explain lurker 

behavior is proposed. Finally, three significant participation 

patterns in accessing and contributing to an online discussion 

board are defined in [10]: workers (proactive participants that are 

continuously involved in discussions), lurkers (peripheral 

participants that regularly access to the board and participate in 

the discussions in read-only mode) and shirkers (parsimonious 

participants that barely access to the board).

A different approach is provided by social network analysis 

techniques, in order to show interactions between learners in 

online discussion threads (learner network) and evaluate their 

participation [9]. Moreover, a great diversity of indicators (depth 

of threads, rhythm, reciprocal readings, cross replies, etc.) is 

used from this approach in order to define effective interaction 

models capable of giving an immediate picture of the 

effectiveness level of a collaborative group [2]. 

Finally, interesting contributions on participation profiles in 

discussion boards of general topics –not strictly educational– can 

be found as well. Several online forums of different topics are 

classified in [3] regarding their predominant user roles rather 

than their topics. Eight different user roles (popular initiators, 

popular participants, joining conversationalists, supporters, 

taciturns, grunts, elitists and ignored) are identified through an 

analysis method based on PCA (the most dominant feature in the 

largest component is selected in order to define three bands of 

users and discard the lowest and middle ones –marginal 

participation profiles–) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering 

(the optimal number of clusters is selected after an inspection of 

the solutions provided by different validation techniques). 

3. CLUSTERING ALGORITHM 
The modeling strategy in the present work is based on identifying 

participation profiles from the different activity patterns 

conducted by learners in online discussion forums. In order to 

group learners with similar activity patterns together, a clustering 

algorithm is used [11]. Due to the number of relevant patterns 

(i.e., the number of relevant clusters) is a priori unknown, we use 

an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm [3]. 

The outcome of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering 

algorithm is not a data partition, but a dendrogram-type graph 

[7]. A dendrogram is a hierarchical tree structure formed by links 

that join couples of clusters together in a new cluster (i.e., each 

link defines a possible cluster of data) from the beginning 

(singleton clusters –i.e., one cluster per learner–) to the end (a 

unique cluster including the whole set of data –i.e., all learners 

grouped together–) of the tree. The heights of the links 

correspond to the distance between the couple of clusters joined 

as a new cluster under the link. The similarity measure between 

clusters depends on the linkage function defined in the algorithm: 

the Single Link (nearest neighbor) and Complete Link (furthest 

neighbor) are the most popular linkage functions [7]. 

A dendrogram is a useful tool for both visually exploring 

similarities between data (data exploratory analysis) and 

obtaining data partitions (clusters of data). Classical strategies to 

get a data partition consist in cutting the dendrogram at any 

defined threshold height and dismiss the links above the cut [7]. 

More interesting is to evaluate links in terms of their 

inconsistency instead of their height and define a threshold 

inconsistency in order to dismiss the most inconsistent links [12]. 

Finally, more versatile strategies try to isolate clusters separately 

as the dendrogram grows, for the sake of flexibility and to be 

able to detect both sparse and dense clusters [4]. 

The agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm used in this 

paper combines the strategy of isolating clusters separately 

(instead of getting a final data partition in one go by a single cut 

in the dendrogram) with a modified version of the inconsistency 

criterion defined in [12]. Our algorithm builds the whole 

dendrogram and isolates its best cluster in terms of a consistency 

criterion (the best cluster is the one defined by the most 

consistent link). Once the best cluster is isolated, this process is 

iterated until there is no remaining data to be isolated. 

Thus, taking the gap concept (height increment between 

consecutive links) proposed in [4], we define: 

( )[ ] ( )iiii nkuzc ??= max  

as the consistency of the i-th link in the dendrogram, being:

where gapi is the gap above i-th link, iµ and i? are the mean and 

the standard deviation of the population formed by gapi and the 

gaps above all the links nested under the i-th link (zi is the 

standard score of gapi), ui is the set of standard scores of the gaps 

above all the links nested under the i-th link, NTOT is the total 

amount of elements (i.e., learners) in the data set, ni is the 

amount of elements within the cluster defined by the i-th link 

and k(ni) is an exponential correction applied to avoid isolating 

too small size clusters (k(ni) is less than ? when ni is less than 

the ? % of NTOT). 

4. DATA SET 
The experiments conducted in this paper analyze the activity 

carried out by learners within the online discussion forums of 

three different subjects in a virtual Telecommunications Degree 

(Electronic Circuits, Linear Systems Theory and Mathematics) 

and throughout three complete semesters (from February 2009 to 

July 2010). All the courses took place in an asynchronous web-

based teaching-learning environment and the participation of 

learners in discussion boards was not mandatory, but strongly 

recommended. Thus, the whole dataset involves a total amount of 

672 learners (NTOT) distributed in eighteen different virtual 

classrooms and a total amount of 3842 posts. Total withdrawal 

and passing rates are 36.31% and 52.23%, respectively. 

5. MODELING ACTIVITY AND FINDING 
PARTICIPATION PROFILES 
The analysis strategy conducted in the present work consists of 

two main stages. In the first stage, learners’ activity in online 

discussion forums is characterized in two different domains 

(writing and reading) and learners with similar activity patterns 

are grouped together in each domain separately. 

The activity carried out by learners is differently characterized in 

each domain (different parameters are used depending on the 

domain). In writing domain, each learner is characterized 

according the following four parameters (all of them are ratios 

over learner’s specific virtual classroom and semester): ratio of 

threads –weighted by their respective depths– initiated by learner 

over total amount of threads –weighted, as well– (depth), ratio of 

reply posts written by learner over total amount of reply posts 

(reposts), ratio of learners replied –at least, once– by learner over 

total  amount of  learners (recross ) and ratio of  days when learner

Table 1. This table shows how the participation profiles are identified. Combining the resultant clusters from the first stage of 

analysis, the final set of clusters is obtained (i.e., learners belonging to WRi and RDj clusters belong now to the new WRi–RDj 

cluster). In the table, final clusters are represented in rows, first column show the final clusters labels, N column (% over NTOT) 

indicates the amount of learners per cluster, Withdrawal and Passing columns (% over N) indicate withdrawal and passing rates 

at the end of semester, Average Representatives (Centroids) columns show each final cluster’s average representative (in terms 

of the eight different parameters used to characterize learners’ activity), and the last two columns describe the participation 

profiles represented by each final cluster (by identifying the different participation profiles proposed in [10]).

Figure 1. This figure shows the resulting dendrograms from clustering learners in terms of (a) writing and (b) reading. 

Each dendrogram legend indicates the assigned label to each cluster, which can be identified by its color. According to 

the criterion defined by the algorithm, resultant clusters are nested under the most consistent links in the dendrogram. 

Each cluster top height corresponds to the distance between the furthest learners within the cluster (Complete Link).

writes at least one post over total amount of days (wrrhythm). 

Other four different parameters are used in the reading domain 

(self-readings are excluded): ratio of posts read by learner over 

total amount of posts (rdposts), ratio of threads where learner 

reads at least one post over total amount of threads (rdthreads), 

ratio of learners read –at least, once– by learner over total 

amount of learners (rdcross) and ratio of days when learner read at 

least one post over total amount of days (rdrhythm). 

Learners are separately clustered in both domains by using the 

agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm described in 

Section 3 with the following configuration: Normalized 

Euclidean Distance, Complete Link, 10=?  and 9.0=? . 

Results obtained in both domains are shown in Figure 1. 

Finally, the second stage of the analysis strategy consists in 

grouping together those learners belonging to the same clusters 

in both writing and reading domains. Thus, the final set of 

clusters that completely defines the different activity patterns and 

allows to identify the participation profiles of learners in online 

discussion forums is obtained (see Table 1). Participation 

profiles are mapped to final clusters by observing and comparing 

the values of the parameters that characterize the learners’ 

activity patterns in each cluster. Final clusters’ centroids allow to 

confirm the suitability of this mapping and to describe and 

characterize the participation profiles in more detail. 

Some interesting remarks can be made from the obtained results. 

Regarding the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm 

performance, it allows to find clusters of different size and 

density in both different domains (e.g., in Figure 1 (a), WR2 

cluster is larger and denser than the smaller and sparser WR3). 

Participation profiles like the ones describe in [10] can be easily 

identified by observing final clusters’ centroids (see Table 1): 

shirkers (inactive learners) are grouped within WR1-RD1 and 

WR2-RD1 clusters (centroids with no kind, or negligible, activity 

at all); lurkers (only readers), within WR1-RD2/…/-RD5 clusters 

(centroids with no kind of reading activity and different patterns 

of writing activity); and workers (active learners), within WR2-

RD2/…/-RD5 and WR3-RD4/-RD5 clusters (different patterns of 

both writing and reading activity). Furthermore, specific sub-

profiles for lurkers (low- and mid-level lurkers) and workers 

(low-, mid- and high-level workers) have been defined depending 

on differences between centroids’ values of reading and writing 

parameters, respectively. 

Empty possible combinations (WR3-RD1/…/-RD3) are also 

useful to deduce some –pretty logical– conclusions: writing 

involves reading, but not the other way around (reading does not 

necessarily involve writing –lurking behavior–). Besides, 

differences between centroids’ values can be useful to identify 

other kinds of participation profiles as well (e.g., the different 

user roles proposed in [3]: popular initiators, popular 

participants, joining conversationalists, supporters, taciturns, 

elitists, grunts and ignored). 

Finally, some interesting conclusions regarding on performance 

differences between profiles can be pointed out: the withdrawal 

rates of shirkers and low-level lurkers are the top highest and the 

passing rates of high-level lurkers are comparable with the ones 

of high- and mid-level workers’ (which are logically the top 

highest). 

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a two-stage strategy in order to model learner 

participation profiles in online discussion forums is proposed. 

The presented agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm 

successfully isolates the more relevant activity patterns in 

different domains (writing and reading). The obtained final 

clusters actually group learners with similar activity patterns and 

allow to satisfactorily identify different participation profiles in 

online discussion forums. In terms of future work, the number of 

domains in first analysis stage will be increased (rhythm domain, 

neighboring domain, etc.) and the impact of this increasing on 

both the presented clustering algorithm suitability and the 

identification of participation profiles accuracy will be checked.
