ABSTRACT
This paper introduces two measures for the recommenda-
tion of study materials based on students’ past study activ-
ity. We use records from the Virtual Learning Environment
(VLE) and analyse the activity of previous students. We as-
sume that the activity of past students represents patterns,
which can be used as a basis for recommendations to current
students.

The measures we define are Relevance, for description of
a supposed VLE activity derived from previous students of
the course, and Effort, that represents the actual effort of
individual current students. Based on these measures, we
propose a composite measure, which we call Importance.

We use data from the previous course presentations to
evaluate of the consistency of students’ behaviour. We use
correlation of the defined measures Relevance and Average
Effort to evaluate the behaviour of two different student
cohorts and the Root Mean Square Error to measure the
deviation of Average Effort and individual student Effort.

ommendation of learning materials and the creation of per-
sonalised study plans ([8][2][4][11]).

In order to improve student learning, it is necessary to
know which learning activities lead the students towards
success. In the case of an online environment with large
amounts of materials, this might be difficult to obtain man-
ually. However, there are several techniques that allows to
process the data an automated way. The important is to
specify strategy which might by use for description and rep-
resentation of data.

Recommender systems provide information, items of in-
terest or services to the user according to the users’ activ-
ities and preferences. This paper presents a new approach
to recommender design. Recommenders evaluate user be-
haviour and preferences and offer the user the most appro-
priate learning resource. There are different recommender
techniques [1] [12] implemented in a number of recommender
systems [7][15]. According to [12] these techniques can be
divided into four categories:

• Collaborative techniques construct recommenda-
tions from the behaviour and results of similar learners.
Similarity is usually calculated from the VLE activi-
ties of the recommendation recipient and other learn-
ers in the present or past courses. A detailed descrip-
tion of collaborative recommenders can be found in
[12][3][5][2].

• Content-based techniques use for recommendation
only information about the users and their histories
[12]. Typical problem solving methods are Case Based
Reasoning and Attribute-based techniques, which de-
rive the recommendations from the learner profile [1][6]
[18][12][14].

• Matrix/tensor factorization techniques consist of
decomposition of a tensor to factors. The recommen-
dation calculates factorization of known tensor values,
and use the product of factors to obtain the vector of
unknown values. For details see [16].

• Association rules are machine learning techniques
for discovering dependence patterns in data. The rec-
ommender mines rules from activities of learners in the
past to recommend activities to the current learner.
Examples of association rules used for recommenda-
tion are in [10][17].



The approach presented in this paper draws from the col-
laborative techniques and association rules. We evaluate the
VLE activities of successful students in the previous presen-
tation, compare it with the currently supported learner and
recommend activities that should decrease the differences
between the two. Some topics introduced earlier in the study
plan are prerequisites for ones presented later, e.g. knowing
the HTML language is necessary to understand the design
of web applications. These dependencies are reflected in the
learner behaviour and could be discovered from the measures
introduced in this paper.

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
At the Open University (OU), courses (modules) take usu-

ally about 40 weeks and are offered to students in a number
of consecutive years. Each module has a study plan which
breaks the course content down into Blocks. Each Block
presents a different topic taught in the course and is further
divided into Parts (1 week long). Thus, Block 1 Part 1 refers
to week 1, Block 1 part 2 to week 2, etc. The study plan
usually does not significantly change between presentations.
Study materials are provided in the Virtual Learning Envi-
ronment (VLE) and therefore student clicks can be recorded.
Each click has a ‘semantic label’ called activity type, which
indicates the kind of interaction with the VLE. Examples
of activity types are forum, resource, ou-content or quiz.
Clicks on different activity types have different information
content; resource is a page with text in pdf and therefore one
click provides access to all the underlying content. On the
other hand, ou-content refers to the study materials repre-
sented in usually highly structured HTML and the number
of VLE accesses pretty well represents student effort. Key
study materials in modules are represented as ou-content
and for this reason we analyse clicks labeled as ou-content,
both in the previous, already completed presentation and in
the current one.

Each block in the study plan has associated expected
study time. However, since student VLE interactions in the
previous presentations are recorded, the real effort required
for understanding each topic can be measured in terms of
the average number of clicks of successful students on the
corresponding web pages. We assume that the performance
of students who passed the previous presentation well ap-
proximates the effort required at present.

The problem addressed in this paper is how to use ou-
content VLE activities of the previous presentation and VLE
data collected from current students to design a person-
alised study recommender that navigates students through
the study plan.

Measuring of the time-on-task is not simple [9]. In our
case the approximation by number of clicks is sufficient.

3. RECOMMENDATION STRATEGY
The recommendation strategy is constructed from rele-

vance of the study material and learners’ activity. These
concept are formally defined in the following sections.

3.1 Capturing study materials’ relevance
Relevance is defined as a normalized difference of the aver-

age cumulative students activity a, measured by the cumu-
lative number of clicks on a specific study activity, between
two consecutive weeks i-1 and i :

R (w, a) =

?w
i=1 cp (i, a)?

?w?1
i=1 cp (i, a)?N

i=1 cp (i, a)
, (1)

where cp (i, a) is the number of clicks for the activity a in
week i,

?w
i=1 cp (i, a),

?w?1
i=1 cp (i, a) are cumulative clicks

from the beginning (week 1) to week w and w ? 1, respec-
tively.

?N
i=1 cp (i, a) is the cumulative sum until the last

week N of the previous presentation. Henceforth:

• Relevance is always non-negative, ?w?a,R (w, a) ? 0,

• sum of the Relevance for each activity over all weeks
is 1, ?a,

?
w R (w, a) = 1,

• Relevance of each activity is the same for all students.

An example of the cumulative clicks for 5 selected activ-
ities is shown in Figure 1, the corresponding relevance is
shown in Figure 2.

3.2 Capturing learners’ activity
Further, we need a measure that can capture the activity

of the learner in the VLE, that can be related to relevance.
Therefore, we create a measure Effort and define it as:

E (w, a) =

?w
i=1 cc (i, a)?

?w?1
i=1 cc (i, a)?N

i=1 cp (i, a)
, (2)

where cc (i, a) is number of clicks for activity a in week i
from current student,cp (i, a) is number of clicks for activity
a in week i from previous presentation,

?w?1
i=1 cc,

?w
i=1 cc (i, a)

are the numbers of cumulative clicks for given activity from
the beginning of the current presentation to week w? 1 and
w, respectively, and

?N
i=1 cp (i, a) is the number of cumula-

tive clicks until the last week of the previous presentation.
Henceforth:

• sum of the Effort for each activity over all weeks can
reach one of the following eventuality:

?a,
?
w

E (w, a) is

???????????????????

< 1, if
?N

i=1 cp (i, a)

>
?w

i=1 cc (i, a)

= 1, if
?N

i=1 cp (i, a)

=
?w

i=1 cc (i, a)

> 1, if
?N

i=1 cp (i, a)

<
?w

i=1 cc (i, a)

(3)

• Effort is given for each student individually.

• Average Effort is given as average of Effort over all
students

Thus, the effort represents an approximation of the progress
for the given activity for an individual student. An example
of effort is shown in Figure 3.

Relevance and Effort, formalized by (1) and (2), capture
our intuition of a transferring of the past experience (Rele-
vance) to the behaviour of current student (Effort).

3.3 Recommendation
Thus, we propose a recommender strategy to output for

each activity a in week i it’s Importance as:

I (w, a) = R (w ? 1, a)? E (w ? 1, a) , (4)

where R (w ? 1, a) and E (w ? 1, a) are appropriate Rele-
vance and Effort for given activity in a previous week, re-
spectively. Thus, the Importance represents a combination
of information of the Relevance of some activity in the pre-
vious week and Effort of the student for the given activity.

4. EVALUATION
We can empirically evaluate similarity between students

behaviour for the current and previous presentation. We use
2014 presentation for computing the Relevance and 2015 as
the presentation for retrieving the learners Effort.

In both presentations, we select only successful students.
We disregard the failed/withdrawn students because the pre-

vious research [13] shows that VLE behaviour is the discrim-
inative factor between successful and unsuccessful students.
From the previous presentation we selected 1,062 students
and from the current one 922 students. We focus only on the
activity types for which we know that the repeated clicking
is relevant, i.e. ou-content.

The Relevance and the Effort are both positive for all
activities and weeks. If we use an Average Effort (over all
students) in particular weeks, we can postulate that the Rel-
evance and the Average Effort should be correlated. To
measure the similarity, we use Pearson’s correlation.

Figure 4 shows that the Relevance of the educational ac-
tivities in the previous presentation is similar with the Effort
in the current presentation across all the weeks for successful
students. This means that a) the behaviour of the successful
students does not change from the previous to the current
presentation and b) the use of Effort value will recommend
the activity which should allow the learner to achieve similar
results as the successful students in the topics where they

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we propose a novel strategy for personalized

study recommendation that utilises the information from
the successful students in the previous presentation. We
define two measures, Relevance and Effort, which describe
a past students’ behaviour and current student’s effort, re-
spectively. Further, we define the theoretical principle of the
recommendation based on these two measures, which we call
Importance.

We use the historical VLE activity for evaluation of our
concept by correlating Relevance and Effort, which repre-
sents consistency of students behaviour between both pre-
sentations. The result shows a correlation (means ± std =
0.94 ± 0.05) between the activities of previous and current
students. We interpret this finding as confirmation that the
successful students have an important and significant pat-
tern of learning.

Currently, we are enriching the OUAnalyse system with
the proposed recommender and we are planning to evaluate
it’s impact on students behaviour.
