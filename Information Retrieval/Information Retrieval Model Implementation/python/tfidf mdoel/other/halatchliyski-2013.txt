ABSTRACT 
This paper provides an introduction to the scientometric method 

of main path analysis and its application to detecting idea flows in 

an online learning community using data from Wikiversity. We 

see this as a step forward in adapting and adopting network 

analysis techniques for analyzing the evolution of artifacts in 

knowledge building communities. The analysis steps are 

presented in detail including the description of a tool environment 

(“workbench”) designed for flexible use by non-computer experts. 

Through the definition of directed acyclic graphs the meaningful 

interconnectedness of learning resources is made accessible to 

analysis in consideration of the temporal sequence of their 

creation during a collaborative process. The potential of the 

method is elaborated for analyzing the overall learning process of 

a community as well as the individual contributions of the 

participants.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, it is commonplace to perceive learning and knowledge 

building as closely related activities on the web. Bereiter and 

Scardamalia [4] point out that knowledge building is essential for 

learning but has a wider scope in that it is not necessarily limited 

to explicit learning scenarios. Knowledge building is based on the 

creation of epistemic artifacts [15] that are shared in a 

community. Research is an example of a knowledge building 

activity that takes place in a scientific community (without being 

characterized as learning). According to Scardamalia and Bereiter 

[21], knowledge building pedagogy takes scientific knowledge 

creation as a blueprint of the learning processes to be facilitated. 

During a knowledge-building process learners are expected to 

discuss ideas and develop their shared knowledge in the manner 

of scientists. The philosophical foundation of this view dates back 

to Popper [18], who explains the development of scientific 

knowledge as a constant process of emergence of new ideas and 

their gradual improvement or abandonment after discovering 

contradictory evidence. In fact, any learning community will 

define concepts and build its knowledge base in a similar way 

[24]. 

Due to the relation between scientific production and learning in 

communities, it should be possible to study both phenomena 

using the same analytical approaches. Scientometrics as a research 

field is particularly concerned with the quantitative measurement 

of scientific work, so it offers a variety of approaches that are new 

to the area of learning analytics but might be fruitful to borrow. 

Scientometric methods are tailored for the analysis of knowledge 

artifacts, most prominently publications, and their authors. One 

well-known method is the calculation of the h-index as a measure 

of scientific reputation [13]. In the context of learning 

communities, however, individual excellence is not a primary 

concern. Rather more interesting would be an approach to the 

long-term characteristics and the dynamics of interactive learning 

environments.  

Hummon and Doreian [14] have proposed a method to detect the 

main idea flows based on citation networks using a corpus of 

publications in DNA biology as an exemplar. Our work reported 

in this paper takes this method, namely main path analysis, as a 

starting point in the analysis of a broad range of knowledge 

processes that take place in formal as well as informal 

collaborative settings. 

After a first promising application of main path analysis to 

networks of knowledge artifacts created for educational purposes

[10], we now want to elaborate on the adaptation and adequate 

formalization of the method. Our guiding question in this 

endeavor is: What kind of insights can be gained from the main 

path analysis of knowledge creation in online learning 

communities? We will explore this question using data from 

Wikiversity as an example1. Wikiversity is understood by its 

active members as an “Open Learning Community” in which 

users can actively produce learning resources for a broad range of 

topics in the form of web-based hypermedia. In our view it 

represents a challenging and yet relevant field for exploring the 

potential of scientometric methodology to tackle the dynamics of 

computer-supported learning processes. 

2. BACKGROUND 

2.1 Community learning 
New knowledge in the world might be the accomplishment of an 

individual, but it is inconceivable without the body of previously 

existing knowledge that in turn has been established by many 

other individuals. Consequently, learning and development of 

new knowledge require to be examined in the context of the 

community where they take place. 

Online communities like Wikiversity facilitate learning through 

the creation of a shared knowledge base in the form of digital 

artifacts such as texts, pictures or other multimedia. Users can 

passively learn by making use of the existing artifacts. Users can 

also actively learn by participating in the creation of new artifacts. 

The knowledge building theory suggests incorporating such 

activity in formal education [21]. Students are expected to benefit 

from self-motivated exploration of knowledge areas when they 

share and build on each other’s findings in a collaborative online 

environment. During this long-term process the shared community 

knowledge develops as ideas are constantly being improved by the 

participants. 

The collaborative production of digital knowledge artifacts has 

become widespread since the emergence of Web 2.0. Widely and 

easily available tools such as wikis afford a long-term process of 

mass collaboration, as artifacts are built piece-by-piece and 

individual contributions can have a variable size. Moreover, a 

single contribution to an artifact can be revised or be built upon in 

order to produce newer versions. Every change to the shared 

artifacts of a wiki community can be logged as an individual 

contribution activity, but the ongoing development of the 

knowledge base is an emergent product of the community efforts 

as a whole. Intersubjectivity and shared meaning-making are 

epiphenomena of the interaction among individuals in a 

community [24]. From the systemic view of the co-evolution 

model of individual learning and collaborative knowledge 

building [5], a community and the participating individuals 

function as two different types of systems that co-evolve through 

mutual fertilization. Knowledge development is reflected in the 

changing shape and content of the artifacts. 

Knowledge artifacts often hold connections among themselves 

that are marked by higher-level semantic structures like topical 

relations, problem-solution chains, discourses, etc. Regardless 

whether these connections are deliberately made by the 

participants in a community or whether they are automatically 

produced by the online environment, in any case hypermedia links

bear meaning. That meaning is an integral part of the knowledge 

created by a community. It is also subject to change, as 

connections are added or deleted in parallel with the artifact 

development.  

In sum, the learning in a community represents a complex process 

that is dependent on the activities of many participants and 

supported by the use and development of artifacts as learning 

resources. The process evolves with the constant change of the 

shared knowledge base at the level of single resources or their 

interconnections. 

2.2 Temporality of a learning process 
The learning of an individual or of a whole community is a 

process that essentially develops over periods of time. New 

knowledge is built upon the existing knowledge. A knowledge 

base develops gradually as its information contents evolves. 

Single ideas become more concrete, they can flow together or split 

into independent directions, marking a convergence or a 

divergence in the development process [9]. At a higher level of 

abstraction, the interconnections within the knowledge base also 

develop when new ideas are added to the existing content, or 

when the already existing connections are subsequently changed. 

All these changes are themselves a focal point of study in order to 

understand the corresponding learning processes. Accordingly, 

the temporal dimension should be regarded as a main component 

of learning analytics. However, the modeling of the overall 

process of knowledge development is challenging, as it should be 

kept track of the sequential relations between all the changes in 

the knowledge base. Any aggregation across time easily leads to a 

biased analysis of individual and community-level variables. A 

longitudinal study of different points in time is also an 

unsatisfactory option, as it misses out the authorship of the 

changes that have been made between the chosen time points. 

Especially difficult is to grasp the nonlinear flow of ideas that is 

characteristic of any learning process. 

Previous work in the area of computer-supported learning has 

paid attention to the interactivity of collaborative processes and 

thereby implicitly to learning dynamics. Environment data logs 

have been used to describe and map interaction patterns. Their 

interpretation has often been supported by additional analysis of 

the content in the case of discussion board messages (see for 

example Hara et al. [11] and Schrire [23]). Suthers et al. [25] also 

presented a universal framework for describing interactivity in the 

form of uptakes between contributors independent of the 

environment that is used. Nevertheless, the field of learning 

analytics still needs a method to address the temporality of 

learning processes quantitatively. Aspects that have to be further 

kept into account include: who influenced whom, which ideas 

were taken up in later stages and which were not, and how 

differently do the participants contribute to the overall learning 

process. The method should also be adaptable to the multiplicity 

of learning environments and communities that have emerged 

with Web 2.0. 

Social network analysis (SNA) has been used in various areas, 

including computer-supported collaborative learning 

[1][6][12][19]. The basic approach relies on representing 

communication events as links between the actors in the network. 

The resulting network structure will very much depend on the 

time span during which these events are collected [28]. However, 

the target representation does no longer represent temporal 

67



 

characteristics. This is the reason why SNA has been criticized for 

eliminating time. Although advances are being made to analyze 

the development of networks, these rather rarely address true 

network dynamics. Process temporality represents a major 

dimension of online learning and should not be ignored in an 

analysis. In this paper we present a network analysis technique 

that can explicitly address learning dynamics in the context of an 

open learning community. 

3. USING MAIN PATH ANALYSIS TO 

MODEL KNOWLEDGE EVOLUTION 

3.1 Analyzing actor-artifact networks 
The knowledge building process develops around the creation of 

knowledge artifacts. A specific version of a so-called two-mode-

network can be build on the basis of the relation between the actor 

(or author) and the artifact (or product). In the SNA methodology 

[26], such two-mode-networks are also called affiliation networks. 

In the pure form, these networks are assumed to be bi-partite, i.e. 

only alternating links actor-artifact (“created/modified”) or 

artifact-actor (“created/modified-by”) would be allowed. Using 

simple matrix operations such bi-partite two-mode-networks can 

be “folded” into homogeneous (one-mode) networks. Here, e.g., 

two actors would be associated if they have acted upon the same 

artifact. We would then say that the relation between the actors 

was mediated by the artifact. A typical example of such a 

transformation is offered by co-publication networks based on co-

authorship. Similarly, we can derive relationship between artifacts 

by considering agents (engaged in the creation of two different 

artifacts) as mediators.  

The “pure” view of actor-artifact relations as bi-partite networks 

has a clear mathematical-operational structure. However, there are 

good reasons to extend this approach: Both, actors and artifacts 

may be interrelated in other ways than by this type cross-wise 

mediation. For instance, social relations between actors may 

operate independent of the artifact mediation. Semantic relations 

may be salient between knowledge artifacts as in the “semantic 

web”. Mika [17] was one of the first to elaborate on methods and 

potential gains of blending social and semantic network 

structures. Other approaches allocate actors and artifacts on 

different layers of a multi-layer model with homogeneous relation 

within each layer and heterogeneous relations in between [20]. 

Such multi-relational representations may appear to be superior in 

expressiveness, however, operations in such structures are more 

difficult to define. 

As any other network representation also actor-artifact networks 

fail to capture the notion of time explicitly. However, time may be 

implicitly modeled in the network relations. In the scientometric 

field, this is the case for citation networks: If a publication X cites 

another publication Y, we can safely assume that Y is older than 

X. The ensuing network structure does not contain cycles 

(excluding specific rare cases of cross-citation). The main path 

analysis method builds on such acyclic citation networks and can 

also be adapted to the dynamics of networks of knowledge 

artifacts built in the process of online collaborative learning. 

3.2 Main path analysis 
The main path analysis [14] is a network analysis technique for 

the scientometric study of scientific citations over a period of 

time. Its major application is the identification of key publications 

in the development of a scientific field. While a lot of 

scientometric methods, such as the analyses of co-citation and co-

authorship networks, accent the semantic structure of scientific 

work, the main path analysis additionally considers the temporal 

structure of development. Temporality is explicitly accounted for 

through the very definition of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) 

where nodes are single publications and directed edges represent 

citations between publications. The direction of an edge 

corresponds to the flow of knowledge from the cited publication 

to the citing publication. Therefore, these links incorporate both 

the dimension of content relations and the temporal order of the 

contributions.  

A DAG always contains at least one node with no ingoing edges 

(i.e., a source) and at least one node with no outgoing edges (i.e., 

a sink). In the citation network of scientific publications within 

one field, often one important publication is chosen as a starting 

point of the development of the field. This publication represents 

the first source. Later on, other sources can become prominent 

and cited, even if they have not cited previous publications in the 

field. Sink nodes then represent either unimportant or very new 

publications that have not been cited yet.  

The main path can be described as the most used path in a citation 

network taking all possible paths from the source nodes to the 

sink nodes. This most used path can be found by a two step 

procedure where, firstly, the traversal counts for each edge are 

calculated as the number of paths between each source and sink 

nodes that go through this edge and, secondly, an algorithm is 

used to identify the main path based on the edge traversal counts. 

This paper employs the search path count (SPC) algorithm [2] 

that introduces one virtual source node and one virtual sink node 

and links these to each of the actual source and sink nodes, 

respectively. In the example in Figure 1 the new nodes are 1 and 

10. Their only purpose is to simplify the original procedure [14] 

of weight calculation for the edges connecting the real nodes. 

Starting at the fictive source node, the main path is identified by 

successively following the edge with the maximal weight to the 

next node until the fictive sink node is reached. At node 7 in 

Figure 1, there are two possible alternatives to reach the next 

node, because both outgoing edges have the same traversal 

weight. In this case the main path branches.

The SPC algorithm might present a too strict approach to the idea 

of main path depending on the nature of the graph. For the case 

when the analysis requires a broader view on the main 

contributions in a field Liu and Lin [16] suggested lowering the 

search constraint by defining a threshold. By this modification in 

each step one chooses not only the edges with the maximum 

weight but also edges with weight above a certain percentage of 

the maximum weight. This procedure was called multiple main 

paths analysis [16]. 

Methods related to the main path analysis represent a structural 

approach that is appropriate for addressing the dynamics of online 

community learning. Depending on the nature of hyperlinks, a 

DAG may trace the flow of idea influences or the change in 

meanings that marks knowledge development. The technique 

allows identifying the most influential contributions and their 

authors in the course of building up a community knowledge base 

over time. It also facilitates the characterization of the overall 

discourse trajectory in collaborative learning [9]. 

4. WIKIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT AND 

DATA 

4.1 General description 
Wikiversity is an online learning environment operating on a wiki 

technology. Like its larger and also older sister projects Wikipedia 

and Wikibooks Wikiversity is offered in many languages and 

directed at any Internet user. It is not designed as an online 

version of a university structure providing courses or exam 

certificates. It is rather an open space for collaborative learning to 

be used by any groups of participants according to their learning 

goals. A major feature is the openness of the created artifacts and 

the community practices to constructive suggestions and 

participation by any interested user. In effect, Wikiversity as a so-

called open learning community constantly developing 

accumulates a rather diverse body of many types of learning 

resources that are loosely structured in topics reaching from 

accounting to zoology. 

The project pages in Wikiversity categorized under the same 

category are often set up by different users and may serve 

different purposes. Nevertheless, there are often hyperlink 

interconnections between them and contributors often join 

multiple projects after they have been started. Because of the 

openness there is a great variety of participation modes within and 

between the different topic categories. 

4.2 Extracting wiki data for main path 

analysis 
As explained in section 3 the main path analysis has originally 

been developed as a method to investigate the main discourse 

structure of scientific fields, using networks of publications linked 

by citations. However, the analysis method is not restricted to this 

field of application. Moreover, it can be applied to any kind of 

directed acyclic graphs (DAG). In this paper we show how to 

employ the main path analysis approach to examine the 

development of interconnected learning resources related to a 

knowledge domain in the context of a wiki environment. 

For all analyses presented in this paper we do not examine the 

complete data of a wiki but make use of the concept of 

MediaWiki2 categories in order to identify the body of artifacts 

related to a specific knowledge domain. Each wiki page can be 

categorized under one or more categories. The categories are 

themselves structured in subcategories. The actual data gathering 

process usually starts with extracting the complete subcategory 

structure by following subcategory link structures of arbitrary 

length starting from a given category. In a second step all pages 

which are categorized into at least one of the categories found in 

this structure are identified. It is not mandatory that each wiki 

page is categorized, but approximately 70 percent of all articles in 

the English Wikiversity belong to at least one category. Thus, we 

assume that our procedure yields a complete selection of the 

major learning resources in a knowledge domain. The opposite 

case of wrongly considering pages that are unrelated to a domain 

needs to be eliminated. This can happen when complete 

subcategory structures are extracted. One example is the category 

“Electrical engineering” which contains “Wikiversity” as a 

subcategory with its large number of administrative pages that are 

factually unrelated to electrical engineering. Therefore, a list of 

subcategories for exclusion from the extraction process needs to 

be predefined. 

As a next step, a directed acyclic graph is constructed describing 

the complete flow of knowledge within a single domain in a wiki. 

Networks of hypermedia resources in a wiki are analogous to 

networks of publications that are interconnected by citations. Wiki 

pages can be regarded as publications that are linked by 

hyperlinks instead of citations. Both, citations and hyperlinks 

have a direction indicating flow of knowledge from a source (i.e. a 

cited paper or a hyperlinked page) to a target (i.e. a citing paper or 

a hyperlinking page). 

In contrast to scientific publications, which are published once 

and then stay the same from that point on, wiki pages evolve over 

time under the collaborative efforts by community members. The 

temporal stability of publications is crucial for the generation of a 

DAG from citation networks. Publications and the citations 

featured in their content are published once and do not change 

over time. Moreover, only works that have already been published 

can be cited. Therefore publication networks form a DAG in a 

natural way. This, however, does not apply to wiki pages as their 

content can be changed at any time. Furthermore, it is a quite 

natural situation that one page is hyperlinked to a second page 

and, at the same time, the second page links back to the first one, 

thus introducing a cycle. To overcome this problem we propose 

using revision information.  

Regarding stability over time, revisions of a wiki page behave like 

classical publications. They are created (published) at a certain 

point in time and do not change later on. A change to a wiki page 

will result in a new revision and thus a modified content of that 

page but not in a modification of the former revision. This 

approach suggests using page revisions instead of wiki pages as 

nodes in a DAG extracted from a wiki data. We distinguish 

between two types of directed edges in such graphs: update edges 

and hyperlink edges. Update edges can be introduced between 

any two directly subsequent revision nodes that belong to the 

same page. Update edges are directed from the older revision to 

the newer, updated revision and, thus, represent knowledge flow 

over the course of the collaborative process on a single wiki page.

Hyperlink edges can be traced between two revision nodes that 

belong to different pages with a hyperlink pointing from one to 

the other. Hyperlinks can be interpreted as inversely directed 

knowledge flows, so in the proposed DAG hyperlink edges go in a 

direction opposite to the direction of the hyperlinks. The target 

revision node includes the hyperlink in its content and thus 

belongs to the hyperlinking page. The corresponding source 

revision node has to be inferred by taking the creation time of the 

revisions into account, because the hyperlink used in a wiki 

almost exclusively points to a page and not to a specific revision. 

The source revision node of a hyperlink edge can be established 

as the latest revision of the hyperlinked page at the moment of 

creation of the target revision. Thus, a hyperlink edge in the DAG 

starts at the latest revision of a hyperlinked page relative to the 

creation time of the relevant hyperlink and points to the revision 

node of another page containing that hyperlink. 

 
Figure 2. On the left: a DAG with all extracted edges.  

On the right: the graph after filtering out redundant hyperlink 

edges. 

 

The described construction procedure results into a two-relational 

DAG that feature update edges between revisions of a single page 

on the one hand and hyperlink edges between revisions of two 

related pages on the other hand. The procedure also guarantees 

that all update and all hyperlink edges are directed from a 

preceding revision to a succeeding revision in time. An example 

for such a DAG can be seen on the left-hand side of  

Figure 2. All edges are pointed downwards depicting the 

knowledge flow over time. Update edges are represented as gray 

arrows, hyperlink edges are represented as (solid and dashed) 

black arrows. The dashed arrows are redundant hyperlink edges 

that point to all subsequent target node revisions that retain the 

same hyperlink after it has initially been added to the content of 

the hyperlinked page. All redundant hyperlink edges are filtered 

out in the subsequent step of our procedure as shown on the right-

hand side of Figure 2. The rationale behind this step is that a 

knowledge flow between two wiki artifacts is established once by 

the initiating act of a hyperlink creation between them. 

Together with author information for the single revisions this 

filtering allows determining who the initiator of a certain link is. 

Additional information used for the author profile analysis 

presented in section 4.4 is time and size of single revisions. While 

for the construction of the DAG the time information is only 

needed for ordering the revisions from older to newer the absolute 

time information on revisions allows distinguishing between 

continuous updates of a page in a short time interval and more 

separated edits in case of long intervals between the edits which is 

also used for the author profile analysis. 

In order to visualize the main paths of idea flows in a wiki we use 

the visual metaphor of a swim lane diagram introduced in 

Figure 2. All revisions of one page are represented as nodes 

connected by update edges and ordered in a vertical line. The 

lines of revisions of different pages are drawn parallel forming 

vertical swim lanes. The titles of the single wiki pages are shown 

as labeled nodes at the top of the diagram. Hyperlink edges 

between different pages are depicted as diagonal lines crossing the 

swim lanes. Time is represented on the vertical axis along the 

swim lanes. For any pair of nodes the node closer to the top is the 

earlier of the two revisions. This is true for pairs of revisions of 

the same page as well as for revisions of different pages. Each 

single revision is labeled with an identifier of its author. 

4.3 Analyses and results 
Medicine is a well developed category in Wikiversity and hence it 

is a good choice as an example dataset to explain our analysis 

method. We first applied simple main path analysis with SPC (see 

section 3.2). The result is depicted in Figure 3. The resulting main 

path is traced by articles from the subcategory gynecology starting 

 
 

Figure 3. Simple main path in the medicine domain 

70



 

with an article about the historical development of gynecology. 

This indicates that articles of this subcategory are well connected 

by page links and that the articles are well maintained with long 

update chains.The multiple main paths method as explained in 

section 3.2 was also applied in order to broaden the range of 

important article topics and medicine subcategories in the further 

analysis. Figure 4 shows the multiple main paths as a swim lane 

diagram with additional branches of nodes and edges with a 

branching weight starting with 40 percent of the maximum edge 

weight at a split point. Only at this threshold new article revisions 

appear on the main path. Articles on diabetes as well as tutorials 

on medical advice are now visible in addition to the other 

important contributions. 

 
 

Figure 4. Multiple Main Paths in the medicine domain 

 

Conspicuous about both the simple main path as well as the 

multiple main paths of the medicine category is that interlinking 

between articles has taken place in the early phase of the 

development of the medicine category. In this phase the main path 

branches into revisions of several special articles. 

This may indicate that in the beginning, short after the category 

medicine was founded, the authors in this category built up the 

basic structure of the knowledge domain. The main relations and 

idea flows between the learning materials were established early 

in the development of the domain. After that the authors have 

been focusing on elaborating the articles without introducing new 

important hyperlinks. The overall picture of the learning process 

in this domain suggests a divergent evolution of ideas after an 

initial period of mutual fertilization between different topics. This 

conforms to the idea of groups of learners that followed different 

interests in the medicine domain with little inter-group 

collaboration on the creation of new shared learning resources. 

4.4 Author profiles 
As explained in section 4.1, Wikiversity is an open environment 

and so there is no standard guideline on how authors should 

interact and use the environment. However, our data reveals 

differences in the contribution activity of authors that can be 

interpreted in terms of a division of roles of contribution to the 

flow of ideas in a Wikiversity knowledge domain. Authors with 

many contributions mostly work on one particular article, 

performing many successive revisions and probably creating the 

largest amount of content in the article. We call them “workers”. 

Other authors are specialized in linking articles and emphasize the 

relations between different topics. They can be regarded as 

“collectors” because they channel the idea flows stemming from 

different articles to create more general articles. A third profile of 

authors is that of “initiators”, who create important article 

revisions that are often referred by other articles later on. 

It can be misleading to define author profiles by only regarding 

the number of created hyperlinks and article revisions. The 

articles, and thus the contributions to them, are not of equal 

importance to the collaborative learning process of the 

community. Many articles are stubs and are not interlinked with 

any other articles within the corresponding category. However, 

the results of the main path analysis of a domain can be 

incorporated in the analysis of the author profiles. Isolated and 

largely unimportant articles are not part of the main path, so each 

update or linking contribution of an author to an article can be 

evaluated differently depending on whether it is part of the main 

path(s). As discussed in section 4.3, the recognition of a single 

main path leads to a strong focus on a small number of revisions 

and articles from a restricted subcategory. Hence, in this paper the 

author profiles are related to the extracted multiple main paths. In 

this way, a more balanced view on activity and division of roles of 

authors can be reached.

Table 1 shows the profiles of five different authors in the category 

medicine. The profiles of authors 12385 and 9375 clearly show 

that output quantity, that is, the number of contributions does not 

necessarily correspond to output quality, that is, the importance 

for the evolution of the discourse structure in a Wikiversity 

category. For example, author 9375 has the highest number of 

contributions among all authors in the medicine category but only 

ten of these contributions appeared on the main paths. 

Furthermore, this author was not significantly involved in 

establishing connections between articles, that is, in facilitating 

knowledge flows. The ten main contributions of this author were 

done successively to the same page “Diabetic foot exam”, as 

shown by the multiple main paths diagram in Figure 4. It seems 

71



 

that author 9375 contributed by mainly constructing the content of 

particular articles, and so this author can be profiled as a worker, 

who focused on elaborating articles. 

A good example for a collector is author 10242. This author was 

also very active in the medicine domain, and the revisions made 

by her or him are often part of the main paths. As Table 1 shows, 

this author created more links to other articles, but her or his own 

revisions received less links. Exemplary of such collective 

behavior are the links established by author 10242 between the 

articles “Diabetes mellitus”, “Diabetes Type I” and “Diabetes 

Type II”. The high number of successive contributions of this 

author was followed by long chains of updates on several articles. 

Author 15539 was also very active and made important 

contributions that appear on the multiple main paths. This author 

edited a large number of different articles and also created a lot of 

links between them. She or he can be regarded as an initiator 

because the article revisions of the author are more often linked by 

other articles than they contain link to other articles. In contrast to 

authors like 10242 this author did not perform long chains of 

successive page revisions but rather authored early article 

revisions, as can be seen on the simple as well as the multiple 

main paths in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. 

5. DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTICS 

TOOLS 
The analysis processes described in this paper have been 

integrated into our network analytics workbench. A form of this 

workbench is used in the ongoing EU project “SISOB”3 which 

has the goal to measure the influence of science on society based 

on the analysis of (social) networks of researchers and created 

artifacts. One area of research in this project is knowledge 

sharing. Thus the analysis techniques based on main path analysis 

presented in this paper are also of essential value in the project 

context. 

We conceive workbenches as a general type of software 

environments designed to serve active and skilled users, without 

assuming the users to be computer experts. We have decided to 

develop a network analytics workbench as a web-based 

environment for several reasons, such as ease of deployment, 

access and update, and independence of the local computing 

facilities and devices. An important part of our experience with 

network analysis and network analysis tools is the need to 

combine several tools even for a single analysis process. The use 

of several tools sometimes also results in the need for conversion 

between the different data formats used by these tools. Therefore 

one important goal behind the development of the network 

analytics workbench is the integration of multiple tools and 

conversion mechanisms into one interface. 

The workbench provides readily available processing chains for 

known use cases and furthermore allows for setting up new ones. 

The user interface (UI) is built upon a pipes and filters metaphor 

for processing chains in order to reduce the complexity of the 

underlying system for users who are not computer experts. An 

example of the UI which has been created using the WireIt4 

JavaScript library can be seen in Figure 5. In using the pipes and

4 http://neyric.github.com/wireit/docs/ 

filters metaphor and being web-based the workbench is similar to 

mashup projects like YAHOO pipes5.  

In contrast to these projects, the actual processing of data in our 

workbench is not part of the user interface code itself but is done 

by a multi agent system which is controlled by the workbench. 

The multi agent system approach allows for combining several 

mostly independent tools into one workflow. These tools can be 

existing tools as well as newly developed tools. Examples for 

existing tools which have been successfully integrated into the 

workbench are the network text analysis tool AutoMap [7], the 

network analysis tool Pajek [3] and a wrapper for the R language6. 

Examples for newly developed components are a MediaWiki 

extraction component based on the mechanism presented in this 

paper and a main path analysis filter also used for the analyses 

presented in this paper. The communication between the web-

based user interface and the agents is based on the SQLSpaces 

[27], an implementation of the tuple space architecture [8]. From 

the user interface a description of the constructed workflow is 

posted into the SQLSpaces server, which contains a message for 

each agent (filter) type that is part of the workflow. These 

messages contain information about the input data and the 

parameter configuration of that filter. 

Figure 5 shows one of the workflows used for the analyses 

described in this paper. The first filter is used to provide input for 

the following filters. In this case it is a filter which connects to a 

MediaWiki database with Wikiversity data and creates a DAG for 

a given category from it. The extraction process follows the 

approach outlined in section 4.2 of this paper. The filter accepts 

two parameters. The name of the category for which the DAG 

should be extracted is a mandatory parameter. The second 

parameter accepts a list of categories to be excluded from the 

search and is optional. The next filter in the workflow presented 

here just duplicates all input into two parallel outputs. Thus, it 

allows performing different analyses on the same possibly 

preprocessed input data in one workflow. In this example the two 

outputs are used to perform main path analysis and analysis of 

author profiles in the same category of a wiki, as present in this 

paper (sections 4.3 and 4.4). On the left hand side the Main Path 

Analysis filter allows selecting a weighting scheme to be used in 

the main path analysis and defining a threshold for the multiple 

main path analysis. The results of this filter are then visualized 

using the swim lane metaphor also used throughout this paper. 

The other branch of the duplicator leads into the Main Path Role 

Assignment filter which generates the tables used for the author 

profile analysis as described in section 4.4. These tables are then 

fed into the Result Downloader which allows downloading these 

results to the local machine for further usage. 

6. CONCLUSION 
Our approach presented in the paper is the first application of 

scientometric methodology for analyzing the flow of ideas in the 

context of an open learning wiki environment. Taking the 

knowledge domain of medicine in Wikiversity as an example, we 

showed how main path analysis can be employed to various kinds 

of knowledge artifacts that are collaboratively created by web-

based communities where learning and knowledge building are 

supported.

The paper presented a procedure for creating directed acyclic 

graphs in this context and for illustrating the obtained main idea 

flows in swim lane diagrams. Our visualization technique allows 

for a unified view of multiple relationships within an artifact 

network of knowledge flows. We further provided sample results 

and interpretations in order to characterize the contribution 

profiles of different authors. We would plausibly assume that 

contributions that lie on a main path have been more valuable for 

the elaboration of ideas in the knowledge network. Finally, our 

methods have been embedded into a web-based analytics 

workbench that supports the definition and re-use of analysis 

modules in a user-friendly visual environment. 

For our future work, we plan to elaborate on the characterization 

of contributions and contributors also in other educational 

knowledge building scenarios. It appears to be promising to 

provide moderators, teachers, tutors or the productive teams 

themselves with results of such analyses, in order to support 

reflective practices [22]. This will raise further challenges 

regarding visualization and cognitive ergonomics.
