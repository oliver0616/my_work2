ABSTRACT 
The increasing use of chat tools for learning and collaboration 
emphasizes the need for automating assessment. We propose a 
text mining approach to automate teamwork assessment in chat 
data. This supervised training approach can be extended to other 
domains for efficient assessment.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Chat texts are complex to analyze due to their short lengths and 
contextual complexities [2]. Conventional analysis of text data 
will not be sufficient to capture the meaning and context of chat 
data. Hence, it requires more levels of processing to automate 
the analysis. The large amount of textual data in big data sets 
like chats makes the process of manual assessment time-
consuming. Automating this process will reduce effort since it 
captures repeated words and ensures consistency.   

In collaborative learning, the teamwork involved is often taken 
for granted. Teamwork is also an important 21st century 
competency. Therefore this study examines teamwork in chat 
data. We design an approach to assess teamwork by automating 
the analysis of chat data using text mining methods. The six 
teamwork dimensions are from the analytic framework to 
measure teamwork competency [3]. This supervised approach 
will require more effort for training the classifiers as it requires 
many steps of rules to be written. However, once the system is 
developed, classification becomes efficient for future analysis. 

2. DATA COLLECTION 
Teamchats, a custom-made chat program based on the open 
source Ajax chat was the chat environment used for this study 
[6]. Secondary school students in Singapore were randomly 
grouped into teams of three or four in the online chat.  

There were a total of 272 students grouped into 76 teams. Two 
tasks – an ice-breaker task and a dilemma task were assigned to 
them through a chat script that was managed by a facilitator. The 
duration of the two chat tasks were about 45 minutes. A total of 
19672 lines were found in 76 teams with a minimum of 71 lines 
and a maximum of 487 lines per team.  

3. PREPARATION 
Before classification and analysis, we prepared the chat data to 
aid machine learning using these two steps. 

3.1 Situation Coding 
A single line of chat cannot be coded for a teamwork dimension 
because the meaning is implied only by the context of the 
previous and the next few lines. So, a set of lines grouped by a 
topic was defined as a “situation”. The situations were derived 
from emergent group development phases [7] but with non-
chronological and interwoven stages in our data.  Manual 
content analysis was used to code situations guided by the 
definitions in Table 1. The rationale was to reduce the ambiguity 
in the text by designating chat lines into these situations. 

Table 1. Definitions for Situations 

Situation Definition 
ST1 
Introduction 

Students get introduced to the chat environment 
and team members. E.g. Hello 

ST2  
Icebreaker task 
preparation 

Students prepare the team members to start the 
ice-breaker task using action words or 
suggestions. E.g. Let’s do the icebreaker 

ST3  
Icebreaker task 
discussion 

Students discuss about the icebreaker task by 
asking questions and contributing ideas using 
content related words. 

ST4 Icebreaker 
task ending 

Students wrap up icebreaker task coming to a 
consensus by summarizing the discussion. 

ST5  
Dilemma task 
preparation 

Students prepare the team members to start the 
dilemma task. This includes transitions and 
question repetition E.g. Identify the problem  

ST6 Dilemma 
task discussion 

Students discuss about the dilemma task by 
contributing ideas, urls and asking questions. 

ST7 Dilemma 
task ending 

Students wrap up dilemma task discussion by 
coming up with a solution with clear consensus. 

ST8       
Team dismissal 

Students leave the team by bidding farewell to 
team members in this last situation. E.g. Bye

3.2 Pre-processing 
The chat data in its raw form contains contents that need to be 
cleaned before processing by the classification system [2]. All 
words should be decapitalized and unnecessary stop words and 
punctuation marks should be removed. The chat language 
should be pre-processed as suggested below followed by 
tokenization of text. 

Acronyms – ikr, nvm ? Use urban dictionary 
Short forms – sry, cher ?Create user-defined dictionary 
Misspellings – discribe, evryone ?Use spell checker with auto-
correct dictionary 
Emoticons - ;), :p ?Convert into indicators 
Purposely misspelled words – soooooo, yayy ?Use regular 
expression pattern matching 
Regional dialect – alamak, can lah ?Define Singlish glossary 
Words with different meanings –2, hw ?Find context with rules 

4. CLASSIFICATION 
The indicators of teamwork dimensions should be carefully 
identified to form the indicative terms dictionary [2]. The 
indicative terms dictionary is used for generating rules for 
categorization in multiple steps to capture context and achieve 
accuracy in assessment. 

4.1 Rule Generation 
Rules will be written iteratively making use of NLP features for 
qualitative analysis of chat data [1, 5]. The following factors 
will be used to automate the coding of teamwork dimensions. 
Existence: The existence of indicative terms will be first 
checked and coded Boolean “yes” if the term is present and “no” 
if not present. 
Frequency: The frequency of indicative terms could be a 
possible indication of the strength of a dimension. Higher 
frequency of words would mean that the situation is more 
indicative of that dimension. However, the most frequent terms 
should be examined with a threshold to check if they add value 
or have no meaning.  
Weightage: Certain indicative terms may hold higher weightage 
than others since they would strongly indicate the presence of a 
dimension. Terms can hold a score according to their weightage. 
Proximity: The position of words in the situations and how far 
they are apart will be useful in identifying certain instances of 
dimensions.  
Complex patterns: More complex patterns combining the 
indicative terms and situations can be written to capture specific 
instances of exceptions in the chat. 

The workflow of automated analysis is shown in Figure 1. Each 
step requires further refining after testing to achieve accuracy.

4.2 Categorization 
Categorization techniques including k-NN, Naive Bayes and 
SVM will be applied for topic classification using training and 
test sets from our data [4] and checked for reliability by 
comparing with manual coding. Scores for the categorized 
teamwork dimensions can be given and then aggregated for each 
student and transferred to the teamwork competency measure. 

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
An approach to automate the analysis of chat data using text 
mining is proposed.  It will improve the accuracy of automated 
analysis by including more steps for identifying the context of 
chat text when compared to the existing approaches. We are 
now in the process of classification using R. We will also need 
to test the reliability of the classifiers with other datasets. 
Nevertheless, we posit that the system is transferable to other 
corpora by defining a new indicative terms dictionary. The 
findings of this study will also be useful in identifying 
appropriate classifiers and visualization techniques for chat data 
analysis. Future work could find ways to automatically identify 
situations based on the time duration, number of messages or 
admin message markers.
