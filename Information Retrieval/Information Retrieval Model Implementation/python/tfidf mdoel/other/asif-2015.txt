ABSTRACT 
This paper, investigates how academic performance of students 
evolves over the years in their studies during a study programme. 
To determine typical progression patterns over the years, students 
are described by a 4 tuple (e.g. x1, x2, x3, x4), these being the 
clusters’ mean to which a student belongs to in each year of the 
degree. For this purpose, two consecutive cohorts have been 
analyzed using X-means clustering. Interestingly the patterns 
found in both cohorts show that a substantial number of students 
stay in the same kind of groups during their studies.

1. INTRODUCTION 
While there are many studies predicting performance of students, 
few works have investigated how performance of students evolves 
during their studies. It would be interesting to answer some 
questions that academics confront as they witness different 
patterns of students performance during the course of their 
studies. For instance, do students with a poor performance in first 
year progress steadily, or on the contrary, keep earning low marks 
all the way through their studies? Do students with a high 
performance in first year retain this high performance till the end 
of their studies? Teachers do encounter these kinds of patterns. 
Are these generalizable to an entire cohort? How scattered is the 
performance of students’ in first year? Does it become more 
heterogeneous or more homogeneous over time? Can these trends 

be calculated in a way that can be easily explained to stakeholders 
and intuitively visualized? This paper presents a case study in that 
area taking marks of students of two follower cohorts of a four-
year degree in information technology discipline. The patterns 
noted during analysis indicate that there is some stability in both 
cohorts and that a substantial number of students stay in the same 
kind of group during their studies.  

A first investigation on the evolution of performance of students 
has been presented in [1]. The focus in [1] is on comparing the 
performance of first year with the performance of students in the 
subsequent years to study if it stays the same or show some 
decrease or increase. The progression of a student is defined and 
used for clustering. Students in the same cluster have a similar 
progression. For example students in the ‘stable’ cluster have a 
performance that always stays in the same interval throughout 
their studies. The ‘stable’ cluster can contain top students or poor 
students with former always having their performance in a high 
interval, and the latter showing a low performance throughout 
their studies. The present study complements this work by 
exploring the change in the performance of students in 
comparison with other students:  students in the same cluster have 
similar marks during their studies. 

An analysis that bears strong similarities with the present work is 
[3] that uses all K-12 marks in all topics to cluster school students 
using hierarchical clustering. Dendrograms are combined with 
heatmaps to provide an intuitive visualization of each student and 
of the groups in the same picture. However, the present study does 
not cluster the students collectively taking all their marks in all 
subjects as performed in [3]. Instead, students are clustered each 
year and then the clusters are combined. This allows to exhibit 
small groups like the group of students who have low marks in 
first year but progress and finish with high marks in last year, or 
vice versa.  

The paper is organized in five sections. After introducing the 
study in the first section, data and analysis methods and results are 
presented in sections 2 and 3 respectively. Discussions are 
presented in section 4 followed by conclusions in the last section 
that also reflects on the present work and discusses future 
research. 

2. DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
Students’ marks of a four-year IT bachelor degree of the NED 
University of Engineering & Technology (NEDUET), Karachi, 
have been used in this study. Two subsequent cohorts have been 
analysed to better identify the recurrent trends. Cohort 1 has 105 
students who graduated in 2012, and cohort 2 comprises 104 
students who graduated in 2013. Table 1 and Table 2 provide an

overview of the distribution of marks of the students over the four 
years for the two cohorts. The average marks of each student for 
each year have been calculated as a number from 0 (worst mark) 
to 100 (best mark). 50 is the minimum required mark to pass. Due 
to the strict placement process at the university followed by 
rigorous academic procedures, there is almost no trend of students 
failing the degree or dropping out.  
 
Table 1. Distribution of the marks over the four years cohort 1 

 90-100 80-90 70-80 60-70 50-60 
year1 0 9 56 31 9 
year2 0 13 55 25 12 
year3 1 47 37 16 4 
year4 6 62 26 11 0 

 

It may be noticed from the data presented in tables 1&2 that 
marks over time tend to become better, though for cohort 2 in year 
2 there is a shift from the interval 70-80 towards 60-70 and 50-60. 
It is also observed that cohort 2 has slightly better marks than 
cohort 1 in first year only. In subsequent years cohort 1 has better 
marks.

To discover typical performance patterns over the years, students 
have been clustered each year taking their final marks of each 
course in each year. The list of all courses over the four years is 
presented in Table 3. Except for a few exceptions, the number 
associated to the name of a course indicates the year in which the 
course is offered. For example CT-153 is taught in first year, 
while CS-251 is taught in second year and CT-354 in third year. 

Clustering has been done using the X-Means and the K-means 
algorithms of the tool RapidMiner taking the Euclidean distance 
for both algorithms. The X-Means algorithm is a modification of 
K-means that includes an automatic estimation of the optimal 
number of clusters [6].  It is well known that the cohesion of each 
cluster increases with K, the number of clusters. However a big 
value of K gives a model or clustering which is more complex. X-
means relies on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to find a 
trade-off between cohesion and complexity. It turns out that the 
sets of clusters obtained applying K-means and SSE (Sum of 
Squared Errors) to determine an optimal number of clusters on 
one hand, and applying X-means on the other hand, while not 
exactly the same, are not fundamentally different: they show the 
same trends in the data. Both algorithms provide clusters of 
students with low marks in all courses, intermediate marks in all 
courses and high marks in all courses. In this paper we give the 
results obtained with X-means.  

Each cluster is characterized by a set of centroids, the mean of the 
marks obtained by the students in the cluster for each course. As 
will be explained with more details in the next section, the mean    
of all centroids is calculated and is used to describe each student 
by a 4-tuple, the cluster s/he belongs to in each year of the degree.  

3. RESULTS 
This section presents the results of X-means clustering that has 
been applied to the examination data of the students belonging to 
Cohort 1 in section 3.1, and Cohort 2 in section 3.2.  

3.1 Cohort1 
Tables 5 to 8 present the observed clusters that are depicted 
through their centroids. One can notice that the number of clusters 
found is relatively small, 3 clusters each year, except year 3 with 4 
clusters. One notices also that each clustering in each year can be 
qualitatively described in exactly the same way: lowest marks in 
all courses, intermediate marks in all courses and highest marks in 
all courses. There is no cluster that represents low marks in course 
c1 and c2, and high marks in course c3, c4 and c5 for example.

As mentioned earlier, the mean of all centroids of each cluster in 
each year is calculated and rounded as an integer. For example 
consider Table 5: The mean of cluster ‘Low’ is 60, the mean of 
cluster ‘Intermediate’ is 71 and the mean of cluster ‘High’ is 78. 
To obtain an intuitive overview of how the performance of 
students globally evolves over the four years qualitatively, each 
student is described by a 4-tuple whose elements are the means of 
the centroids of the clusters the student belongs to. For example a 
student belonging to the cluster with the lowest mark in first year 
and second year, with intermediate-low marks in third year and 
intermediate marks in fourth year will be represented by the tuple 
(60, 52, 66, 77) while a student belonging to the cluster with high 
marks in all four years will be described by the tuple: (78, 73, 83, 
85). 

Figure 1 aggregates all the tuples of all students. The height of the 
bar represents the number of students characterized by the same 
tuple. The diagram is ordered from right to left: low values on the 
right, and high values on the left.  

 
Figure 1. Tuples summary of Cohort1. 

The color indicates the first year clusters. The 2nd year is depicted 
at the bottom of the diagram and divided into three parts: 52, 62 
and 73 corresponding to the means of the clusters Low, 
Intermediate and High. Each of these three parts is divided by the 
clusters of 3rd year. Note for example, that part 52 of 2nd year is 
divided only by the parts 66 and 54 of 3rd year as there are no 
student with low marks in 2nd year and intermediate-high or high 
marks in 3rd year. Finally the highest level of the hierarchy divides 
further each part with the clusters of the 4th year. 

The left most bar indicates the number of students, here 17, who 
have high marks in all four years and described by the tuple (78, 
73, 83, 85). The right most bar gives the number of students, here 
11, with low marks in all years and described by the tuple (60, 52, 
54, 65). The second highest bar indicates that 13 students are 
characterized by the tuple (71, 73, 75, 77): except in second year 
these students were always in a group with intermediate marks.  

110



The number of bars, here 28, gives the number of tuples that 
describes all students. Though the number of clusters each year is 
quite small, the number of combinations present in the data is not 
small anymore.  

3.2 Cohort2 
The clusters for cohort 2 are illustrated through their centroids in 
Tables 9 to 12. As observed for cohort 1, the number of clusters is 
also relatively small, 3 clusters each year, but for year 1, there are 
only 2 clusters. Its analysis show that the clustering follows the 
same trend as for cohort 1 i.e. low marks in all courses, 
intermediate marks in all courses and high mark in all courses.

Table 13 gives the total number of students in each cluster for all 
four years. Like cohort 1, most of the students belong to the 
intermediate cluster in all years except in first year; remember that 
first year does not have an intermediate cluster. This matches well 
Table 2, which has the highest number of students in the interval 
70-80 in all four years.

As for cohort 1, Figure 10 shows all the tuples of all students of 
cohort 2.  

 
Figure 2. Tuples summary of Cohort2. 

The left most bar indicates the number of students, here 18, who 
have high marks in all four years and described by the tuple (73, 
78, 79, 84). The right most bar gives the number of students, here 
24, with low marks in all years and described by the tuple (60, 58, 
60, 65). The third highest bar indicates that 15 students are 
characterized by the tuple (73, 69, 70, 76): except in first year 
these students are always in a group with intermediate marks.  
There are 23 bars; all students are described by 23 different tuples.  

4. DISCUSSION 
The clustering results of cohort 1 and cohort 2 confirm the shift 
towards better marks over the four years as observed in Tables 1 
and 2. The data reveal that the mean of all clusters tends to 
increase. Consider the mean of the clusters with low marks. It 
takes the values 60, 52, 54 and 65 for cohort 1 and the values 60, 
58, 60 and 65 for cohort 2. The smaller numbers 52 and 54 in 
cohort 1 have to be placed in relation with the small size of the 
clusters, as shown in Table 4.  Similarly, the means of the clusters 
with high marks take the values 78, 73, 83, 85 for cohort 1 and 73, 
78, 79, 84 for cohort 2. Figure 1 and 2 suggest that the scattering 
of performance in each year for the two cohorts stays stable as the 
differences between the mean of the cluster with low marks and 
the mean of the cluster with high marks do not change much over 
the years. This is further confirmed by the standard deviation (SD) 
of all courses in each year as the values of SD do not change 
much between the years.

The tuple summaries show two important groups of students: the 
top students, bar on the left, and the weak students, bar on the 
right. Top students have high marks in all four years and this 
group is equally important in both cohorts. Weak students have 
low marks in all four years and this group is slightly bigger for 
cohort 2 than for cohort 1.  
Other significant groups for both cohorts are those constituted of 
students who have intermediate marks in all years except for one 
year. The second and fourth highest bars of Figure 1 show such 
groups for cohort 1:  students with intermediate marks in all years 
but in 2nd year where they have high marks make up the second 
highest bar and students with intermediate marks but in 1st year, 
where they have low marks, make up the fourth highest bar.  The 
third and fourth highest bars of Figure 2 are other examples of 
students having mainly intermediate marks for cohort 2.  

More generally, the two diagrams Figure 1 and 2 shows that a 
significant number of students remain stable during their studies 
which means they tend to remain in the same kind of group. 

A glaring observation is presence of more high bars towards the 
left of Figure 1, as compared to Figure 2. This indicates that there 
are more students with higher marks in year 2, and high or 
intermediate marks in year 3 and 4 in cohort 1 than in cohort 2, 
which visualizes the trend given by Tables 1 and 2.  
Figure 1 and 2 also show that there are atypical students that are 
described as weak students in 1st year who progress in 2nd year 
and finish with intermediate or high marks in 4th year. They are 
found looking for red bars towards the left of the diagram. 
Another interesting but relatively small group is constituted by 
students who have high marks in 1st year but low marks in all 
subsequent years. They are represented by spotting the green or 
blue bars in the right of the diagram. There are 2 of them in cohort 
2 and 1 in cohort 1. Because of the shift towards good marks, the 
progression of atypical students is more spectacular than the 
regression of the last 3 students. 

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presents a work that shows how the performance of the 
students evolves over the years in their studies. Two consecutive 
cohorts have been analyzed by using X-means clustering 
algorithm.  

As presented in the preceding discussion, a sizable number of 
students tend to stay in the same kind of group throughout four 
years in the two cohorts. There are very few atypical students: 
students who begin with low marks in 1st year and finish with high 
marks in 4th year, or the other way round: students who begin 
with high marks but from 2nd year earn only low marks. In both 
cohorts one observes a shift towards better marks over the years, 
though this shift is more visible for cohort 1 than for cohort 2. 
This shift towards better marks could be explained in relation with 
the university policy for calculating the final marks at the end of 
the degree with year-wise weighting as follows: 10% of first year 
examination marks, 20% of second year examination marks, 30% 
of third year examination marks and 40% of fourth year 
examination marks. 

The work reported in [2] shows that it is possible to use one 
cohort to predict the performance of the subsequent cohort. 
Indeed, taking cohort 1 as training set, performance of cohort 2 
has been predicted with an accuracy varying from 55.77% to 
83.65% and a ? varying from 0.352 to 0.727 using different 
classifiers. These results are comparable to the ones obtained in 
other works like [4, 5, 7] that use cross validation, which means 
one cohort only, to validate prediction. The present research 
complements this work in showing that the two cohorts exhibit the 
same trends regarding performance evolution over the four years.  

This study provides the direction for a future work to study the 
relationship between the results of progression with those of 
prediction of performance. Another future work may be to explore 
other visualizations to capture at a glance the progression of the 
performance of students over the years better. Finally an 
important future work is to take action. The findings exhibit a 
group of students with low marks all the way through their 
studies. They could be identified in first year already and receive 
special attention. Thus these findings have to be discussed with 
teachers and heads of department.
