ABSTRACT 
Despite the mounting evidence supporting the role that goal 
setting has on the learning process, there seems to be only a 
handful of studies that directly investigate goal setting in the 
context of Learning Analytics (LA). Although investigations have 
incorporated elements of goal setting, the attention afforded to 
theory and operationalization have been modest. In this workshop 
we plan to position goal setting at the forefront of LA research. 
The workshop will serve as a venue to bring together researchers 
interested in advancing Goal Setting (GS) research in the LA 
field. Topics include: (1) GS theory and measurement; (2) 
analysis and visualization of GS data; (3) strategies for integrating 
GS in the learning experience; and (4) implementation of GS 
technologies. Participants who need tools to execute their GS 
ideas and those who already have tools and are exploring better 
ways to integrate a goal setting feature can gain a lot from this 
workshop. Moreover, participants will have the opportunity to 
contribute to the conceptualization and staging of GS ideas in LA 
research.

1. MOTIVATION 
Since learning is oftentimes a goal oriented process, Goal Setting 
(GS) theory with its firm track record in educational research, 
specifically in studies about student motivation, has the potential 
to address one of the aims of Learning Analytics, that is, to 
optimize learning [2, 4, 5, 7]. Learning goals guide learners to 
where learning is relevant and enable them to focus their effort 
and attention to goal-related activities [3]. The focus is made 

possible by highlighting aspects important for learning while 
ignoring irrelevant ones. 
Another way in which goal setting might contribute to advancing 
LA is that it may be used to facilitate self-reflection through goal 
progress tracking. When learners set goals they engage in what is 
called a discrepancy-creating process [6]. The subsequent process 
of resolving this discrepancy allows learners to reflect on their 
performance and to adjust the magnitude and direction of their 
effort to match goal requirements. Goal setting as a self-reflection 
mechanism also has important implications for self-regulated 
learning (SRL). In a study involving high achieving students, it 
was found that an increase in mastery goals led to the increasing 
use of SRL strategies [1].  
Goal reasoning, a framework dedicated to the application of goal 
setting in the context of intelligent systems, is investigating ways 
of giving artificial systems the autonomy to formulate, select and 
manage goals. LA, being at  the crossroad of educational research 
and information technology, has a lot to gain from this framework 
[8]. As learners interact with educational technologies that 
support goal setting, these technologies may collect and analyze 
learners’ goal orientations and goal setting activities. Using this 
setup it may be feasible to provide students with goal 
recommendations that are tailored to their own context, 
personality, preferences, and orientations. With the 
implementation of such technologies, goal setting may contribute 
to yet another aim of LA, that is, prediction which refers to 
forecasting learners’ next move. One of its applications is in 
predicting student drop-out or attrition. In the context of goal 
setting, goal prediction refers to forecasting what goals that 
students might want to pursue next in order to achieve a learning 
outcome. What we are envisaging then is that goals which were 
shown to lead to better performance in one cohort of students are 
recommended to individual students in the subsequent cohort. 
A final way in which goal setting might contribute to advancing 
LA is that it has the potential to generate primary data pertaining 
to students’ offline learning activities, thereby addressing an 
important limitation of those LA studies that are based on 
secondary data generated by administrative systems or electronic 
learning environments. 
Given these potential contributions, the time is ripe to bring 
together LA and Goal Setting researchers in an open marketplace 
of ideas. This workshop will be an opportunity to consolidate 
research findings from educational research, learning technologies 
and research within LA itself.

2. OBJECTIVES 
The main objectives of the workshop is to bring together 
researchers, so as to discuss ongoing research and identify 
promising directions for studies that apply GS in the LA context. 
It hopes to bring together researchers from both the ‘learning’ side 
and ‘analytics’ side to discuss the underpinning rationale for 
design choices in the context of data-driven learning and teaching. 
Specifically we will discuss the theoretical and empirical aspects 
of traditional GS as applied to education. Moreover, the workshop 
will also serve as a venue where technologies supporting goal 
setting can be demonstrated. In this regard, the workshop will 
showcase a work in-progress experiment in which goal-setting is 
embedded in courses using a standalone dashboard. It will 
demonstrate the quality of LMS data with regard to applying LA 
techniques to ‘extract’ meaning. Lastly, analytics applied to data 
collected through goal setting technologies will be addressed. 

3. WORKSHOP FORMAT 
3.1 Audience 
The workshop is open to all LA researchers with an interest in 
GS. Relevant fields on the ‘learning’ side are learning science, 
educational psychology, assessment and evaluation, curriculum 
and pedagogy design, management (because goal-setting has been 
widely used in HR management across industries, experts in this 
field bring in knowledge of this concept). Relevant fields on the 
data side are educational data mining, machine learning, HCI, 
computer sciences, and educational statistics. 
There will be a call for papers1 inviting contributions relevant to 
the workshop topics. The topics are aggregated into four topical 
groups, namely, (1) GS theory, (2) GS measurement and analytics, 
(3) the relationship between GS and other educational outcomes 
such as interest, motivation, engagement, and academic 
performance, and (4) GS technologies. Accepted papers will be 
published in the CEUR workshop proceedings. 

3.2 Format 
We propose a half-day workshop with at most four paper 
presentations and at most two software demonstrations. 
The first part of the workshop will be an introduction of the 
workshop by the organizers. This will be followed by a keynote 
about Goal Setting in the academic context. Afterwards, workshop 
participants will be assigned to three groups. Each group will 
discuss one of these three topic groups: GS Theory, GS 
measurement and analytics, and Relationship between GS and 
other education outcomes. 
The lead discussants of each group are the authors of the accepted 
papers assisted by the organizers. Authors of accepted papers are 
requested to prepare a 10-15 minute presentation and the 
presentations should incorporate what have transpired during the 
group discussion.  
Group discussion will last for an hour. While having discussions 
the participants can pause for a coffee break. After group 
discussions, the presentations will start. There will be a short 
question and answer portion after every presentation. Aside from 
the presentation there will be a demo of GS technologies and 
sample use cases. The demo will cover the fourth topical group 
which is the GS technologies. After all presentations are done,

there will be an open forum. The open forum will be directed to 
further elaborate the role of GS in the LA setting and discuss 
outstanding issues. The workshop will end by wrapping up the 
main points that have emerged during the discussions and explore 
the possibility of establishing a GS Special Interest Group (SIG) 
within LA. The SIG will have the primary mandate of advancing 
and popularizing GS research in the context of LA.
