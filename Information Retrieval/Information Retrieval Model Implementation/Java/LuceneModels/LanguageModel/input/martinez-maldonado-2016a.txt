ABSTRACT 
It is of high relevance to the LAK community to explore 
blended learning scenarios where students can interact at 
diverse digital and physical learning spaces. This 
workshop aims to gather the sub-community of LAK 
researchers, learning scientists and researchers from other 
communities, interested in ubiquitous, mobile and/or face-
to-face learning analytics. An overarching concern is how 
to integrate and coordinate learning analytics to provide 
continued support to learning across digital and physical 
spaces. The goals of the workshop are to share approaches 
and identify a set of guidelines to design and connect 
Learning Analytics solutions according to the pedagogical 
needs and contextual constraints to provide support across 
digital and physical learning spaces.

1. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 
Students’ learning commonly occurs in spaces and at moments 
that go beyond formal education, and this learning is not 
constrained to a single physical or digital environment [5, 10]. 
Research in the learning sciences (LS), computer-supported 
collaborative learning (CSCL) and technology-enhanced 
learning (TEL) has revealed the pedagogical benefits of letting 

students experience different types of content, "real world" 
challenges, and physical and social interactions with educators 
or other learners [2, 8]. Increasing access to emerging 
communication technologies have made it possible for students 
to make use of a wide range of devices and educational (and 
non-educational) software applications. At the same time, 
educational providers, including schools and universities, 
deploy a variety of educational technologies and pedagogical 
resources in both online and face-to-face settings [9]. These 
technologies allow learners to get remote access to educational 
resources from different physical spaces (ubiquitous learning 
support) or to enrich their learning experiences in the classroom 
in ways that were not previously possible (face-to-face learning 
support). In short, there is an increasing interest in providing 
support for students’ learning across physical and digital spaces. 

It is of high relevance to the LAK community to explore 
student’s activity in blended learning scenarios where they can 
interact at diverse digital and physical learning spaces. The 
challenge is to find the best approaches that can be applied to 
automatically capture traces of students’ activity, and understand 
how learning analytics techniques can be used in this context to 
exploit these (often) heterogeneous data.  This workshop aims to 
gather the sub-community of LAK researchers interested in 
ubiquitous, mobile and/or face-to-face learning analytics in 
conjunction with learning scientists and researchers from other 
communities who have explored the perspective of learning 
across digital and physical spaces. This aim is aligned with the 
theme of LAK 2016 by focusing on the Convergence of 
Communities for Grounding and Implementation of Learning 
Analytics solutions across physical and digital spaces. 

Providing continued support in the classroom, for mobile 
experiences and using web-based systems has been explored to 
different extents and each poses its own challenges [9, 11]. An 
overarching concern is how to integrate analytics across all 
those three spaces in a coordinated way. The goal of the 
workshop is to share approaches and exchange information 
about how educational data science can be brought to bear to 
provide continued support across varied spatiotemporal learning 
situations and identify a set of guidelines to design and connect 
Learning Analytics solutions according to the pedagogical needs 
and contextual constraints of practitioners.

2. WORKSHOP THEMES 
The workshop will focus on the following four themes:   
1. Learning analytics across digital spaces (e.g. [4]). 

Examples of application of learning analytics in educational 
settings where multiple digital technologies (digital spaces, 
learning environments, tools such as  e-books, learning 
management systems, e-portfolio systems, social network 
platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, etc), connected or 
disconnected, are used to facilitate different learning 
activities. 

2. Learning analytics bridging physical (and digital) spaces 
(e.g. [6]). Examples of application of learning analytics in 
educational settings with an significant face-to-
face component (e.g. the classroom, the computer lab, 
collocated experimental settings, etc), a blend of collocated 
face-to-face and remote learning activities, or experimental 
approaches to gather collaborative student’s data while 
interacting with various systems.  

3. Mobile and ubiquitous learning analytics (e.g. [1, 7]). 
Examples of application of learning analytics in ubiquitous 
educational settings with an important component of 
student’s mobility and where the learning activity spans 
across various physical and digital spaces. 

4. Data integration of heterogeneous learning data sources 
(e.g. refer to [3, 4]). Examples learning analytics solutions to 
collect, gather and synchronise student’s activity data 
coming from varied heterogeneous data sources.  

3. EXPECTED OUTCOMES 
The expected outcomes of the workshop are the following:   

1. Definition of the research gap. This workshop also will aim 
to help identify still unsolved challenges and future research 
lines in Learning Analytics across Spaces and set grounding 
for possible joint research efforts. 

2. Guidelines or principles for R&D. The workshop will bring 
together the sub-communities within CSCL/LS, TEL, and 
LAK with the goal of contributing with expert 
guidelines/principles that can help guide future research and 
development to create learning analytics and monitoring 
tools that can provide support for each of the four themes 
posed above.  

3. Dissemination of R&D of LA across spaces. All the 
outcomes of the workshop, including the outcomes listed 
above and the papers submitted, will be made available 
through the workshop’s own website or an online wiki so 
other members of the LAK community can benefit and 
further contribute to the design space. 

4. CONCLUSION 
While this workshop can be considered to be grounded on a 
consolidated line interest on the topic of learning across spaces, 
in this case the focus is on the particular challenges to provide 
continued support to students by using learning analytics 
techniques. More detailed information about the workshop 
organisers, authors, program and outcomes of the workshop can
