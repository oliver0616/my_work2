ABSTRACT 
Temporal reasoning (i.e., reasoning about relationships across 
time) is complex and difficult, particularly when engaged through 
complex media such as online Geographic Information System 
(GIS) applications. Partnering with Social Explorer (SE), a Web-
based GIS application that allows users to create interactive 
visualizations of large sociological datasets, we engaged in 
frequent sequential pattern mining of a database of users’ 
interactions with SE. The resulting frequent sequences provide 
initial descriptions of how SE affords opportunities to engage in 
temporal reasoning.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The increasing availability of very large data sets has captured the 
imagination of researchers, educators, as well as the general 
public, and there seems to be a consensus that developing the 
skills and dispositions associated with making sense of such data 
sets will be a focal point of future education. Access to large data 
sets through sophisticated online tools has proliferated, yet little is 
known about how these tools impact users’ interpretation of and 
ability to manipulate these data. This is particularly true for the 
use of interactive data visualization tools such as Social Explorer 
(SE), a Web application that leverages Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS) to create visualizations of U.S. census data. As 
individuals interpret and manipulate data with SE, they encounter 
a range of opportunities to explore and make sense of data sets, 
but this diversity of opportunities can also lead to becoming 
“lost,” unable to make sense of the perceived visualizations.  

Temporal reasoning provides a source of difficulty for people 
making sense of data visualizations such as those afforded by SE. 
For instance, population change can be described via multiple 
metrics that are often conflated and confused (e.g., net versus 
percent population growth), especially when considering different 
scales of time and historical contexts [3]. Here, we characterize 
users’ sequential manipulations that change the data visualization 
state as interactions with data (IWD), and attempt to identify 
sequential patterns that are useful for modeling learners’ activity 
with these tools. We start from the premise that users would 
engage in at least two types of temporal IWDs with SE: (1) 
toggling, where the user repeatedly queries data from two or more 
specific time periods (e.g., 2000 Census, then 2010 Census, then 
back to 2000 Census); and (2) stepping, where the user queries 
data from consecutive time periods, either forward or backward in 
time (e.g., from the 2011 American Community Survey [ACS] to 
2012 ACS). Accordingly, this report focuses on analyzing users’ 
sessions with SE, specifically by examining frequent sequential 
patterns [4] that occurred during their interactions with SE and 
using these frequent sequences as descriptors for IWD.  

Since this study of SE Web-log files does not attempt to assess 
users’ reasoning, we view these IWDs as opportunities to engage 
in temporal reasoning, used here to better understand the range of 
contexts in which users might learn to engage in temporal 
reasoning. Toggling can provide opportunities for users to make 
comparisons between data from two or more periods of time, 
while stepping can provide opportunities for users to interpret 
trends that emerge over time. By identifying these opportunities to 
engage, in future work we will examine other logged interactions 
surrounding these sequences. Ultimately, this work will allow us 
to further characterize IWDs as opportunities to engage in 
geospatial or quantitative reasoning, allowing descriptions for the 
relationships within and between these IWDs as well as types of 
reasoning. In the work presented here, we ask:  

1. What frequent sequences emerge from the dataset when we 
focus on temporal reasoning? 

2. How do these frequent sequences help describe the IWD 
learners exhibit with SE, particularly toggling and stepping?  

2. METHODOLOGY 
This initial analysis of temporal IWD relies on the data-selection 
interaction with SE, which logs when the user changes the dataset 
they wish to visualize. This comprises changes to any 
combination of the year, survey (e.g., ACS 5-year estimates), 
category (e.g., Race), and variable (e.g., African American). 
These are the four elements of the data-tuple: <y, s, c, v> for year, 
survey, category, and variable. As an initial exploratory study, the 
data-tuple captured in the logs was used to generate an 11-tuple, 
our metadata-tuple, <S, cy, cs, cc, cv, ny, ns, nc, nv, em, ts>. A 
description of these metadata is provided in Table 1.

Boolean values for changes to the data-tuple were generated to 
help discover sequences that explored within as opposed to across 
year-values. Boolean values for new elements of the data-tuple 
allowed discovering sequences that may suggest more exploratory 
IWDs than the two we hypothesized (toggling and stepping). The 
em, or exact-match, Boolean value identified sequences that 
indicated toggling behavior while the ts, or time-step, value 
helped identify sequences of consecutive or non-consecutive 
changes in time (the year). Metadata-tuples were created for each 
session entry within a session that contained at least 10 entries and 
at most 1000 entries, exclusion criteria that helped avoid bots and 
trivial usage of SE. This resulted in a database of 5,856 sessions 
recorded from the SE log system between the dates January 22, 
2014 and February 22, 2014. These sessions had an average of 
9.22 data- selection interactions (s.d. = 13.8). 

For sequence mining, we used an open source, Java-based library 
called SPMF (v. 0.96q) [1]. We applied the CM-SPADE [2] 
algorithm, which uses co-occurrence information to support 
pruning of sequences. Due to the enormous number of potential 
sequences that could be discovered as well as the performance 
information provided by the implementers, we believe this was 
the best decision for our purposes. A minimum support (support is 
the number of sessions that contain a variable of interest) 
threshold of 0.19 (19%) was chosen using a guideline for setting 
such thresholds [4], where the minimum support is set to the level 
of frequency (here, of consecutive time-steps) within the database. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
With such a low threshold for minimum support, we generated 
3,008,063 frequent sequences. Table 2 provides a brief overview 
of these sequences with respect to our metadata-tuple, specifically 
the time-step and exact-match elements. Other than the raw 
number of sequences for each metadata element, the rest of the 
values are means with parenthetical standard deviations.

Even from the gross summary statistics, we see that taking 
sequential, consecutive time-steps as an IWD is extremely rare 
behavior for users of SE. Moreover, these stepping sequences 
only contained one data-selection interaction, suggesting that 
users did not have opportunities to engage in more complex 

reasoning about trends (e.g., sequentially comparing trends of one 
or more variables over time). 

It is also of note that non-consecutive time-steps were rare in our 
corpus of frequent sequences. Take, for example, the sequence (à? 
denotes separate data-selection interactions): nv à? non-ts à? cv. 
This sequence begins with a new variable, takes a non-
consecutive time-step, and then changes the variable. We interpret 
this sequence as an example of another IWD—that of leaping 
between time points. Leaping can provide opportunities to engage 
in comparison between variables in two or more different time 
periods, but it also affords opportunities to explore (and 
potentially get lost in) the dataset.  

However, leaping IWD are an order of magnitude less represented 
than toggling sequences containing exact-matches to previously 
seen data-tuples. As a discussion point, let us use the following 
sequence as an example: ns à? em à? em. This sequence contains 
two data-selection interactions that led to an exact-match, 
suggesting a common IWD is to explore elements of the data-
tuple (here, the survey) and then toggle, one or more times, back 
to previously seen data. This suggests that toggling is, in fact, a 
frequent mode of interaction with the data maps in SE, one that 
affords making multiple comparisons between a set of two or 
more data visualizations. As we examine the temporal reasoning 
users do when toggling, we will better understand how toggling 
mediates inspecting temporal change.  

4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This work elucidates the potential for using frequent sequences as 
a means for detecting and characterizing IWDs and the 
opportunities to learn afforded in those interactions. In so doing, 
we provide a method to study how opportunities to learn are 
mediated by tools such as SE. We hope to use a similar approach 
to characterize IWDs relevant to other forms of reasoning 
afforded by GIS (e.g., quantitative, geospatial, correlational).  
Leveraging frequent sequences in order to identify IWDs as 
opportunities to engage in reasoning moves toward two goals: (1) 
furthering our understanding of IWDs as a useful unit of 
interaction for studying opportunities to learn with tools such as 
SE; and (2) surfacing design implications for map-interface query 
tools to afford engagement with multiple types of complex 
reasoning, including historical reasoning with census data.
