ABSTRACT 
This paper explores a longitudinal approach to combining 
engagement, performance and social connectivity data from a 
MOOC using the framework of exponential random graph 
models (ERGMs). The idea is to model the social network in the 
discussion forum in a given week not only using performance 
(assignment scores) and overall engagement (lecture and 
discussion views) covariates within that week, but also on the 
same person-level covariates from adjacent previous and 
subsequent weeks. We find that over all eight weekly sessions, 
the social networks constructed from the forum interactions are 
relatively sparse and lack the tendency for preferential 
attachment. By analyzing data from the second week, we also 
find that individuals with higher performance scores from 
current, previous, and future weeks tend to be more connected in 
the social network. Engagement with lectures had significant but 
sometimes puzzling effects on social connectivity. However, the 
relationships between social connectivity, performance, and 
engagement weakened over time, and results were not stable 
across weeks.

1. INTRODUCTION 
By its design, the field of learning analytics takes a fine-grained 
approach to using data in service of understanding learning 
processes and supporting outcomes. Learning processes are of 

course contextual, dynamic, social, and highly variable in myriad 
ways. Thus, from a data-driven standpoint, the integration of 
multiple streams of data evolving over time (contextual, 
cognitive, affective, social, etc.) is the ultimate objective. Such 
integration is immensely challenging, requiring interdisciplinary 
efforts and high quality data. 
This paper explores a longitudinal approach to combining 
engagement, performance and social connectivity data from a 
MOOC using the framework of exponential random graph 
models (ERGMs) [32]. The idea is to model the social network 
in the discussion forum in a given week not only using 
performance (quiz scores) and overall engagement (lecture and 
discussion views) covariates within that week, but also using 
person-level covariates from adjacent previous and subsequent 
weeks.  
Our models, described in more detail below, address the 
following questions. First, do engagement with learning content 
and performance on assessments provide additional 
information—beyond the endogenous mechanisms of a random 
network structure—about a learner’s connectedness to others in 
the social network? Second, do time-lagged effects, such as 
joining the discussion in response to struggling with the previous 
assignment, relate to performance and engagement counts from 
the previous week? Addition, rather than substitution, means that 
present-week effects are controlled for, in the sense of multiple 
linear regression predictors, in the estimation of past-week 
effects. Finally we add future-week effects as well. None of these 
are causal models, and there is clearly no causal mechanism for 
future week scores to influence social connectedness. A 
significant positive interaction within this framework, again 
controlling for present and past scores, would suggest that future 
outcomes may be related to social connectedness in the present. 
We note that the approach here contains many important 
simplifications. Links or edges between networked participants 
are dichotomous, that is, they are not weighted by frequency of 
communications or characterized by other measures of type or 
strength. An edge either exists or does not exist. Related to this 
point, but distinct, the content of the forum posts [10] is 
completely ignored in this analysis. Finally, we acknowledge 
that our engagement and performance variables are relatively 
simple distillations of these aspects of the learning experience. 
The caveats above mean that results presented here should be 
taken as preliminary and provisional. Our intention, however, is 
to convey a framework for integrated analysis which can be

2. RELATED WORK 
2.1 Forums as Content Resources 
Discussion forums in a MOOC may be alternately viewed as a 
(dynamic) content resource and as a social resource. These 
characterizations are not mutually exclusive, but they emphasize 
different aspects and suggest different analytic approaches. 
Insofar as students predominantly view posts authored by others, 
for example as a means of finding help with homework or 
information about course policies, the forums are a content 
resource. Of course, there would be no content if no one posted 
to the forum, but it is possible to count posts in addition to views 
as simply two dimensions of forum usage.  
A number of studies have examined the relationship between 
performance (grades), attitudes, and discussion forum usage in 
terms of view and post counts [24, 26, 31]. The methods involved 
in such analyses are typically correlational using aggregated 
values over the duration course. Nevertheless operationalization 
of both predictor and outcome variables poses significant 
challenges, especially when applying similar methods to massive 
open online courses (MOOCs), where the population of users is 
so diverse [6].  

2.1.1 Longitudinal effects 
Week-by-week analysis of forum content, coded according to the 
Collaborative Learning Conversation Skill Taxonomy [38], was 

presented in [39], in order to study the evolution of content over 
time. Models incorporating student change from early to late 
course stages in their (volumetric) use of the forums for 
homework help were examined in [6]. 

2.2 Forums as Social Resources 
The allure of discussion forums as a focus of study on online 
learning lies, at least partly, in connection to theories of learning 
such as social cognitive theory [4], social constructivism [42], and 
connectivism [35]. Insofar as forums are viewed as a social 
resource, the quantity of views or posts or content tags may take 
a back seat to the relational aspect of replying to or receiving a 
reply from another learner. Analyses that emphasize the social 
aspect of discussion forums thus commonly apply some type of 
social network analysis (SNA) to the communication network of 
learners as defined through their forum interactions. 
Information sharing and the flow of content in social networks of 
learners were studied in both distance and on-campus learning 
over a decade ago [3, 9, 18], before the proliferation of learning 
management systems and MOOC platforms [11]. As discussed in 
a recent review of SNA applications in discussion forums [30], 
the most common methods since then have been visualization of 
networks; characterization of users, for example, by centrality; 
and community detection. Recent MOOC applications have 
examined super-poster behavior [21], structure of networks in a 
teacher-oriented MOOC [25], affinity characteristics of 
communities [7], impact of community affiliation on performance 
[8], as well as the distinction between communities and crowds 
[16]. 

2.2.1 Generative network models 
While SNA has often been used to extract descriptive statistics 
about networks and individuals, it is also possible to model the 
network itself as an outcome of a random generating process. 
Such approaches allow one to test hypotheses of reciprocity or 
homophily in a network, as was done using exponential random

graph models (ERGMs) in [2] and [25]. Alternate methods, 
similar in spirit, include latent space models [19] and stochastic 
blockmodels [36]. Hierarchical versions of these were applied to 
teacher networks in [40].  

2.3 Nonsocial networks 
It should be noted that as a general method for learning analytics, 
SNA has also been applied to networks where the entities are not 
persons but rather concepts or states in a state space navigated by 
learners. The use of the word “social” in this context, although 
habitual because of SNA, has the potential to create confusion. 
Community detection applied to a state-space graph in a logic 
tutoring system, for example, was used to identify student pitfalls 
or misconceptions [13]. Network analysis was also applied to eye-
tracking movements in mathematics problem solving in [48].  
 

3. DATA SET 
The dataset used in this study was collected from a Coursera 
course “Big Data in Education” (BDE) offered by Teachers 
College, Columbia University in Fall 2013 [44]. In this course, 
students learned and applied educational data mining and learning 
analytics methods. The course spanned eight weekly sessions, 
each consisting of five to seven lecture videos, readings, and a 
quiz, which requires the students to do data analysis and submit 
the results. All weekly assignments were automatically graded 
and accounted for 100% of the final course grade (70% was the 
threshold for earning a certificate). Students were encouraged to 
use the online forums throughout the duration of the course, and 
this was the principal way in which instructors and TAs interacted 
with learners. 
BDE had over 48,000 enrollees during the duration of the course, 
with a small portion actively participating. A total of 1,380 
students completed at least one assignment, and 638 students 
received a certificate. This study concerns the relationship 
between forum participation and other learning activities. Thus, 
we restrict our attention to the users who posted or commented at 
least once in the forum. This yielded a sample of 770 individuals, 
including students, the instructor, and teaching assistants. Among 
this sample, 440 students (57%) completed at least one 
assignment, and 155 (20%) earned a certificate.  
 
Following the organization of the course, and in order to enable 
comparisons between weeks, we constructed separate datasets for 
each week unit. The cutoff times for assigning events to weeks 
were determined by the release of new units by the instructor, 
rather than by strict calendar intervals. Variables extracted from 
the log data included the number of posts 
initiated/commented/replied, the number of posts viewed, the 
number of video lectures downloaded or viewed, and scores on 
the weekly quizzes. Although the quizzes allowed multiple 
attempts, we computed scores based on whether answers were 
correct on the first attempt. As found by [5], this type of scoring 
resulted in score distributions with more variance and reduced 
ceiling effects than scoring based on eventual correctness. 
 

4. METHODS 
4.1 Constructing social networks from the 
forum posts 
As is typical, a forum thread in BDE was initiated by an original 
poster (OP). Participants could then “reply” to the OP or 
“comment” on previous replies. Although the MOOC data logs 

distinguish these types of actions, students did not consistently 
use them differently. In other words, sometimes a reply was really 
a comment to a specific prior reply, and sometimes a comment 
was really an open reply to the OP. Thus we chose not to 
distinguish these two actions after all.  
The choice arises as to whether a reply should connect its poster 
to everyone who posted previously or only to the OP. This has 
been handled differently in different studies, and depending on 
whether the links are directed or undirected [7, 27]. All 
individuals involved in a post are frequently connected to each 
other in collaboration networks or co-authorship networks [1]. 
The resulting structure will be a fully-connected clique [47]. 
However, we did not adopt this method with the consideration 
that these relations, especially those among the repliers or 
commenters the forum posts, might be much weaker than the 
relations among researchers who co-authored a paper together.  
To construct our social networks, we connected only the OP and 
the subsequent repliers. As a result, each thread is represented by 
a star in the network, with the OP as the node in the middle and 
all others in the periphery. However, there were multiple threads 
in the network for each week. Eight undirected social networks 
were thus constructed. The nodes in the networks are individuals 
and the links indicating the replying or commenting relations. 
The visualizations of the weekly forum interaction social 
networks are shown in Figure 1 (generated using the gplot 
function in the R package Statnet [17]). All networks show a 
relatively big connected component and several smaller 
components in the periphery. The visualizations show the 
network shrinking over time, which is confirmed by basic 
summary statistics. We plot the size, density, size of the largest 
connected component, and the maximum degree of the nodes of 
the networks in Figure 2. These basic network statistics [45] are 
defined as follows. The size of a network is defined as the total 
number of nodes in the network. The density of the undirected 
network is the number of links divided by the maximum possible 
number, which for an undirected graph with n nodes is n(n-1)/2. 
The connected component is defined as the subset of a network, 
in which any two nodes are connected directly or through other 
nodes, and the largest connected component is the one with the 

largest number of nodes. The degree of a node is the count of 
number of links connected to that node, and the maximum degree 
of the nodes in a network is the degree of the most connected 
node. 

 
Figure 2: Basic network statistics for forum interaction 

social networks in BDE. 



The size of the networks decreased from the maximum of 450 in 
the first week to 80 in the eighth week. For each network, the 
largest component consisted of 85% or more of the nodes and thus 
had the same longitudinal trend as the full network. The 
maximum node degree for each network was achieved by either 
the instructor or the head community TA, again following the 
same decreasing trend. On the other hand, the densities of the 
networks increased over time, showing that forum participants 
tend to have closer relations as time went on. Week 5 seemed to 
depart a little in each of these trends, possibly due to the timing 
of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. 
 

4.2 Exponential Random Graph Models 
(ERGMs)  
To relate network measures to individual attributes, one might 
consider using a standard regression approach. However, when 
individuals are embedded in the same network, their network 
attributes (edge/link statistics) are interdependent. These 
dependencies violate the independent observation assumptions of 
regression models. Rather than limit ourselves to correlations 
between descriptive network measures and person (node) 
attributes, we study the relation between network structures and 
node attributes in a framework that explicitly accounts for the 
dependencies among nodes and links. Exponential random graph 
models (ERGMs) [32], also known as p* models, were developed 
specifically for analyzing social network data and testing 
hypotheses on both network structures and on the interactions of 
node attributes with network structures. ERGMs have been 
widely used in applications ranging from the structure of 
adolescent peer influence [41] to social connections in virtual 
worlds [22]. 
The basic idea of ERGMs is to build a stochastic model that 
captures the generative features of an observed social network. 
By analogy with regression models, dependent variables are the 
nodes and links in the observed network, and the independent 
variables are summary statistics for various network structural 
features. Node attribute effects are analogous to interaction terms, 
that is, of node attributes and structural features. Some examples 
of the structural features include links, triangles, stars, or links 
between nodes sharing a particular attribute. The summary 
statistic for links is just the density of a network.  
Mathematically, the general ERGMs are a class of stochastic 
models that share the following general form [46]. 

P"Y = y& = 1k"?& exp -?
.g"y&0 

where Y is a random variable representing the network and 2 is 
the specific observed network. The state space of Y is the 
collection of all possible networks with the same number of nodes 
as the observed network, y. g"y& is a vector of network statistics, 
? is the vector of corresponding coefficients, and 3"?& is a 
normalizing constant. It is calculated by summing up 
exp -?.g"y&0 over the space of all possible networks. 
General ERGMs do not impose any dependence assumptions. 
Rather, one constructs different models by specifying these 
dependence assumptions. For instance, in the simplest case, it can 
be assumed that all links in the network are equivalent and thus 
that the probability of an observed network depends only on the 
number (equivalently, density) of links in the network. This is 
known as the Bernoulli Model or the Erd?s–Rényi Model [14]. It 
is not particularly realistic for most social networks. 

More complex dependency assumptions include dyadic 
independence models (p1) [20], for which reciprocated edges are 
included as a structural feature or, further still, p2 models, which 
add conditional dependence on node-level attributes [12, 28]. In 
Markov random graphs [15], it is assumed that an edge between 
two nodes i and j depends on any other possible edges involving 
i or j. Curved exponential models have introduced nonlinear 
functions of the ? parameters to better capture the structural 
features for social networks [23, 34].  Simulation and estimation 
methods were also developed for ERGMs with the Markov 
dependence assumption [29, 33, 46]. 
The output results of ERGMs (? coefficient estimates) may also 
be interpreted by analogy with regression models. A significant 
positive value for a coefficient corresponding to a structural 
feature, for example, triangles, indicates that this feature occurs 
more than would be expected by chance. For node attributes 
(covariates), the interpretation of the coefficient is a bit different. 
In that case, the conditional log-odds of an edge connecting two 
nodes i and j is understood to be increased by the product of the 
coefficient and the sum of covariate values for the two nodes.  
 

4.3 Variables from the MOOC data 
Social Networks 
For this study, we are interested in the relationship between 
MOOC forum social links and course participants’ behavior and 
performance in current and adjacent weeks. As described in 
Section 4.1, there are eight social networks, one for each week. 
Nodal attributes 
Each individual has four attributes extracted from each week’s 
data, including assignment score (score, the only performance 
attribute), the number of posts initiated/commented/replied 
(posts), the number of posts viewed (post views), and the number 
of video lectures downloaded or played (lectures). Counts of 
posts, post views, and lectures constitute our simplified 
engagement measures. We are also interested in how these 
attribute measures from adjacent weeks are related to the current 
week’s social networks. Thus, the dataset for week 4 includes the 
social network from week 4’s forum data and engagement and 
performance attributes from weeks 3, 4, and 5. 

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
5.1 Hierarchical analysis method for ERGM 
on Week 2 
With the social networks and variables as described in Section 
4.3, we build a hierarchical sequence of ERGMs. We use the R 
package Statnet [17] for the analysis. The variables, blocks, and 
coefficient estimates using the Week 2 data are shown in Table 
1. 
Model 1 serves as the baseline model, which contains two 
structural features of the forum network, edge and alternating k-
stars [23]. The first feature accounts for the density of the 
network, and the second captures the tendency for hubs. As 
shown in Table 1, the negative value for edge (-4.09) indicates 
that the density of the network is lower than would occur by 
chance. A negative value for alternating k-stars (-0.99) indicates 
that hub frequencies are also lower than would occur by chance. 
The phenomenon in which higher degree nodes attract more 
links is known as preferential attachment [1]. In our dataset, even 
though we do see some nodes with high degree, the overall 
generating mechanism does not lean towards adding more links 



to the high degree nodes (after controlling the density of the 
network). 
For Model 2, we add four nodal attributes, two related to 
performance and two related to engagement. Score captures the 
tendency for individuals with high assignment scores to be more 
active in the social network. Score difference captures the 
tendency for two linked individuals to have similar assignment 
scores. With this term, we hope to test the hypothesis that social 
interactions may be more likely between similarly performing 
students. Our engagement attributes account for increasing 
connectedness by individuals who view many posts or lectures.  
The results from Model 2 are a significant positive effect for 
assignment scores on connectedness in the forum network and a 
significant negative effect for lecture views/downloads. The 
score difference and post view effects were not significant. The 
negative effect of lecture engagement is certainly a bit puzzling, 
especially if one thinks of this in terms of high lecture viewing 
being associated with low connectedness. However, the 
mathematically equivalent converse relation—high 
connectedness associated with low lecture viewing—is actually 
plausible if “expert” individuals who already know the content 
do a lot of replying. 

Table 1: ERGMs for Week 2 
 

* indicates p < 0.05; † indicates p < 0.1. Model convergence 
information available upon request. 
 
In Model 3, we added attributes from the previous week (week 1 
for the week 2 model). It turned out that individuals with higher 
assignment scores from the previous week tended to have more 
links in the social network in the current week. Individuals who 
viewed more posts from the previous week also tended to have 
more links in the current week, while individuals who posted 
more in the previous week tended to have fewer links in the 
current week’s social network (controlling for other effects). The 

lecture views/downloads from the previous week did not have a 
significant effect on the current week’s relations. 
Finally, in Model 4 (the full model with all variables), we explore 
whether forum social relations correlate with future learning 
behavior. The effects for both assignment scores and the lecture 
views/downloads were positive and significant, indicating that 
individuals with more social links in the current week tend to have 
higher assignment scores and more lecture views/downloads in 
the next week. 

5.2 Beyond Week 2 
Results from Week 2 offer many interesting findings, especially 
the between-week interactions of social connectedness and 
learner performance and engagement attributes. We ran the full 
set of models on data from week 2 through week 7 (weeks 1 and 
8 were included where appropriate given the inclusion of 
previous or following week counts). Results are reproduced in 
the Appendix for continuity. 
The structural feature effects from the baseline Model 1 are 
relatively stable and consistent over all weeks. However, in more 
complex models, the effects were not consistent with the findings 
in the Week 2 network. For example, in Model 2, the effects of 
score difference were generally not significant, except in Week 
8 where connected individuals did tend to have similar scores. 
The negative effects of lecture engagement (views/downloads) 
held true for Weeks 2, 3, and 4, but not beyond that and pointed 
in the opposite direction for Week 1. Overall, Week 1 exhibited 
exceptions on several effects, which may not be too surprising 
given first week effects in any course.  
Similar observations concerning fading or inconsistent effects 
held true in Models 3 and 4 for network statistics with individual 
attributes from the previous week and subsequent week. The 
effect of previous week score, significantly positive in Week 2, 
was not significant in most other weeks except for Weeks 6 and 
7, and in the latter case, the sign had changed. Subsequent week 
score was consistently a positive effect for Weeks 2 and 3, 
though nonsignificant afterwards. And future lecture 
engagement was significantly positively twice and negative once 
(following Week 5). 
 

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Summarizing the results across all four models for Week 2, our 
major findings are as follows. First, the forum social network is 
relatively sparse and does not tend to have the preferential 
attachment feature observed in a lot of social networks. Second, 
individuals’ assignment scores, from current, previous, and 
future weeks, are all positively related to being more active in 
social network. Third, social connectedness was negatively 
correlated with lecture engagement from this week, but 
positively correlated with lecture engagement in the following 
week. As with regression models, results from the ERGMs do 
not enable one to draw causal conclusions, but they do provide 
evidence about associations. Another finding of this study is that 
it seems that the significant effects in earlier weeks of the course 
do not persist later in the course. Sometimes, the effect directions 
even reversed. 
This study has several limitations, which suggest directions for 
future work. As discussed in the introduction, the meaning of 
social connectedness here remains fairly simple. Links are 
unweighted and reflect only the process of replying (or 
commenting) to an original poster. Content analysis, preferably

automated for scalability, could significantly improve the 
definition of the network itself. Steps toward including natural 
language processing of posts in defining the network are part of 
ongoing work. However, even with a simple criterion for 
network links, a bipartite network [43] could be a useful 
alternative way to model the post-reply structure of a discussion 
forum. In such a network, forum threads and individuals would 
be included as two different types of nodes and directed links 
would represent the contributions of posters to the threads. 
In analyzing our dataset over the weekly sessions, we did find 
different and even inconsistent results between weeks. The 
approach of meta-analysis [37] or hierarchical models [40] might 
be useful in aggregating results and finding the stable trend. On 
the other hand, it would be interesting to analyze and compare 
results from other datasets to see which, if any, of the effects in 
this study generalize to other cases. BDE was a traditional 
MOOC as opposed to a connectivist or social constructivist 
MOOC. It is possible that the interplay between social 
connectedness, engagement, and performance is more 
pronounced and/or consistent in courses that emphasize social 
construction of understanding.
