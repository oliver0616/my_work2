ABSTRACT 
Every college student registers for courses from a catalog of 
numerous offerings each term. Selecting the courses in which to 
enroll, and in what combinations, can dramatically impact each 
student’s chances for academic success. Taking inspiration from 
the STEM Academy, we wanted to identify the characteristics of 
engineering students who graduate with 3.0 or above grade point 
average. The overall goal of the Customized Course Advising 
project is to determine the optimal term-by-term course 
selections for all engineering students based on their incoming 
characteristics and previous course history and performance, 
paying particular attention to concurrent enrollment. We found 
that ACT Math, SAT Math, and Advanced Placement exam can 
be effective measures to measure the students' academic 
preparation level. Also, we found that some concurrent course-
enrollment patterns are highly predictive of first-term and 
overall academic success.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Every college student registers for courses from a catalog of 
hundreds or even thousands of offerings each term. Selecting the 
courses in which to enroll, and in what combinations, can 
dramatically impact each student’s chances for academic 
success, progression towards degree, and retention within the 
field and the institution. Learning analytics has the potential to 
leverage historical student data to better inform students’ 
decisions and ultimately improve their understanding of how 
course content and learning outcomes might better serve their 
ultimate institutional and long-term career objectives. 

First implemented in 2008, the Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Academy identifies 
talented diverse incoming students with interest in STEM fields 
who, for reasons of socioeconomic class, first generation college 
student status, lack of high school rigor, race, or gender, might 
not be successful in pursuing a STEM degree [1]. The STEM 
Academy provides students with a highly coordinated and 
holistic support system during the critical transition years 
between high school graduation and the declaration of a STEM 
concentration by the third undergraduate year. Components of 
the program include an intensive pre-first year summer program, 
academic coaching, limited financial support, mentoring, study 
groups, and community building. 

One of the primary objectives of the STEM Academy is to 
graduate students with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 
3.0 or above. There are a number of predictors of overall GPA at 
completion of the baccalaureate degree [2, 3].  These may 
include, but are not limited to, standardized test scores, first and 
second year college GPA, first-generation college status, and 
family income. What have not been clearly identified are the 
course combinations and sequences that first and second year

students, during this transitional phase from high school to 
college, should take. Nor has the impact on cumulative GPA of 
enrolled students taking some courses at community colleges or 
online and then transferring the credit been studied. 

The STEM Academy’s academic advisers, as well as general 
engineering academic advisers, help students select courses that 
will hopefully lead them on the pathway towards success in their 
chosen academic career. Until recently, academic advising has 
been largely based on advisors’ intuition, prior experience, and 
institutional knowledge. With newly created analytic tools and 
reports, advisors can begin to infer how a particular student may 
perform in following semester, by comparing the data from 
previous students who were in similar condition, such as 
Advanced Placement (AP) credits, previous performance in core 
courses, or demographic data. However, a coherent system is 
needed to bring these disparate data sources together in order to 
better inform the course-selection process for students and their 
advisors alike.  

A course recommendation system can “allow advisors and 
students to make plans for future semesters, equipped with data 
on courses or even majors in which past students with similar 
programs, grades, and course histories had found success” [4]. 
Degree Compass was one of the first such systems to use 
predictive analytics techniques to rank courses using grade and 
enrollment data, delivering information that could potentially 
help a student progress more readily through a chosen program. 
While Degree Compass had initial overall success, the 
predictive model of a C grade (2.0 GPA) or better lacks the 
specificity needed for the highly competitive undergraduate 
environment in which the STEM Academy is situated. 
Furthermore, examining course prediction in isolation obscures 
the variety of course combinations students register for in a 
given academic term; particular combinations can be 
academically hazardous to individual students, depending on 
their academic background. It is therefore necessary to examine 
course-taking behavior in concurrent patterns as well. For both 
academic advisors and students, predictive models utilizing rich 
and meaningful information, can greatly inform students’ 
course-planning decisions, particularly in the critical transition 
years from secondary to higher education. Understanding these 
patterns and student characteristics that can accurately predict 
academic success is a first step before construction of a 
concurrent course recommendation system can begin. This paper 
describes our investigation in service of this goal. 

2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
The overall goal of the Customized Course Advising (CCA) 
project is to determine the optimal term-by-term course 
selections for all engineering students based on their incoming 
characteristics and previous course history and performance, 
paying particular attention to concurrent enrollment. This paper 
describes the preliminary data mining investigation that must 
precede any implementation of a course recommendation system 
in order to identify the key metrics and refine the predictive 
models. The overarching research questions guiding this 
investigation are: 

• What scholastic characteristics of first-year engineering 
students are most predictive of future academic success? 

• What concurrent course-enrollment patterns are most 
predictive of future academic success? 

Uncovering the relationship between first-year engineering 
students’ academic background and their concurrent course 
enrollment is an important and critical component of the 
development of a robust and dynamic course recommendation 
system that is able to consider the totality of a students’ course 
load, academic trajectory, and ultimate goals within the 
institution. 

3. BACKGROUND 
Many students plunge into college level work with no difficulty. 
Other students can struggle and seem to need carefully adjusted 
course loads and sequences that will maximize academic success 
as indicated by course grades and overall GPA while still 
maintaining a reasonable time to degree (and may have positive 
effects on students’ self-efficacy and self-regulation as well). 
This transitional phase for any given student, if needed at all, 
can range from the first semester freshman year up to and 
including the first semester sophomore year.  The challenge lies 
in (1) identifying the student who needs this transitional period 
and (2) determining the combination of courses (A) within a 
given semester, (B) from semester to semester, and (C) transfer 
credit from other academic institutions that will optimize student 
success while still remaining on track to graduation. 

In prior work, members of our research team have worked with 
the STEM Academy to develop Student Explorer, an early 
warning system (see [5], [6]). While early warning systems 
leverage learning analytics techniques to identify students in 
need of additional academic support (e.g., [7]), course 
recommendation systems are designed to be useful for all 
students regardless of perceived need. Both types of systems 
share the goal to ultimately reduce the time and effort involved 
in the “feedback loops” between students, instructors, and 
academic advisors [8]. Early attempts at course recommendation 
systems relied on social input (e.g., [9]), predating automated 
input from student academic history data which utilizes learning 
analytics to identify actionable points of decision-making, in this 
case, which courses, and in what combination, to enroll in a 
given term. Ultimately, the goal of a well-designed course 
recommendation system should be to provide useful data that 
allows the student (and their advisor, if applicable) to make 
intelligent decisions for their own course of study, supporting 
notions of self-advocacy and self-regulated decisions. 
4. METHODOLOGY 
The sample for the analyses was drawn from the data warehouse 
of a large American Midwestern university. According to the 
Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education 
(http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org), this institution is 
a large, public, primarily residential four-year research 
university with very high research activity and a majority 
undergraduate enrollment. The university enrolls approximately 
28,000 undergraduate students, more than 80% of whom are 
enrolled full-time, have entering test scores in the top fifth of all 
American baccalaureate institutions, and fewer than 20% of 
whom transfer in from other institutions. The engineering 
college enrolls approximately 5,800 undergraduate students, 
21% of the total undergraduate population.  

4.1 Data Sources 
Academic history and demographic data from the institutional 
data warehouse was drawn from undergraduate students who 

17



matriculated into the engineering college between the fall 2001 
and fall 2012 semesters (N=12,836). Nearly three-quarters 
(75%) of the students were male and 11.5% were international 
(non-US) students. The average incoming Math ACT score was 
31 (out of 36) and the average incoming Math SAT score was 
709 (out of 800) (ACT and SAT are college readiness 
assessments taken in high school as part of the college 
application process). These students enrolled in 6,877 unique 
courses throughout their undergraduate tenure (some students 
have not yet graduated). 

The warehouse data included records such as students’ course 
enrollment information, credit for courses taken at other 
institutions (transfer credit), achievement and placement test 
scores, and final degree information. In this paper, the analyses 
primarily focused on analyzing enrollment information, which 
included course name, course section, course grade, semester 
GPA, and enrolled term. Students’ preparation level when 
entering university, such as ACT and SAT scores, Advanced 
Placement (AP) credits, and placement tests as well as final 
degree status, such as number of years took to graduate, kind of 
achieved degree, and final GPA, were also included in the 
analyses. The scope of the analysis was limited to enrollment 
data and incoming academic measures, while setting aside 
demographic information. Demographic information was 
excluded to limit the complexity for this preliminary study. 

4.2 Procedure 
The analysis started by identifying the first semester math 
course students selected. Often times, proficiency in math 
readiness assessments is considered as an indicator of success in 
university engineering courses [10]. In this context, the first 
semester math course can be considered as an indicator of 
undergraduate engineering students’ academic preparation level, 
in terms of equivalent credit and subjective confidence in math. 
For example, incoming students can satisfy course requirements 
with AP, IB, or other A-Level Credit exams, and take higher-
level courses in the first semester. This leads to a wide variety of 
first semester course combinations.  

The grade of 3.0 was set as a standard of academic success. This 
standard, a grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, was set 
because it is (1) the minimum GPA required by most 
engineering employers for internships and permanent positions, 
and (2) it is a goal of the STEM Academy. Whether students 
finish their degree as originally entered was also considered as 
an indicator of success. Although students entered the university 
as a part of the engineering program, not all of them graduate 
with an engineering degree.  So if a student graduated from the 
College of Engineering with a final GPA of 3.0 or better, we 
considered this student as successfully graduated as an 
‘engineer’.  

There are six math courses that engineering students can select 
in their first semester. This variety is the widest among all 
subjects in core-required courses that freshmen engineering 
students take, such as engineering, chemistry, and physics. 
Grouping students by their first term math courses was a simple 
and easy way to group students and achieve various profiles 
from many students. 

5. RESULTS 
5.1 Scholastic Characteristics of Engineering 
Students 
In order to predict which students are likely to be successful in 
college, the analysis started from profiling the incoming 
characteristics of students, which include high school GPA, high 
school GPA percentile, ACT math score, and SAT math score. 
Groups were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
and post-hoc Tukey.  

High correlation between first semester GPA and graduation 
GPA (r = 0.763, p < 0.001) showed that first semester 
performance is very important for engineering students. 
Choosing which courses to take in the first semester may 
become a critical decision with students’ academic performance 
throughout the graduation, and selecting the first semester math 
course can be a major determinant of the overall first semester 
performance.  

5.1.1 High School Records, ACT Math Score, and 
SAT Math Score 
Of the six math courses offered in the fall semester that 
freshmen engineering students typically select, four of them, 
Calculus I, Calculus II, Multivariable Calculus, and Differential 
Equations, belong to the engineering core required courses. Two 
other math courses, Pre-Calculus and Applied Honors Calculus 
II are not included in the core courses but are popular choices. 
Pre-Calculus is recommended for students who do not have AP 
credit and the result of math placement test advised them as 
need to take additional preparing course for the later calculus 
sequences. Applied Honors Calculus II is an alternative to 
Calculus II, designed for students who scored a 4 or 5 (out of 5) 
on the Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus exam.  

Records of high school performance were not meaningful for 
predicting the academic performance of students. The 
correlations between students' high school records and first 
semester performance or graduation GPA were significant, but 
the absolute values for coefficients were below 0.1 (Table 1). 
There were significant differences between students' high school 
GPA between starting math courses [F(5, 5779) = 64.66, p < 
0.001]. A post hoc Tukey test showed that the high school GPAs 
of Pre-Calculus students were significantly higher than those of 
students starting with Multivariate Calculus (p < 0.01) and 
Differential Equations (p < 0.001). Students' high school GPA 
percentile had a similar pattern [F(5, 5779) = 67.89, p < 0.001]. 
Engineering students' ACT and SAT math scores, however, 
were positively correlated with first semester GPA and 
graduation GPA, ranging from 0.364 to 0.412 (Table 1). Also, 
students' ACT and SAT math scores, on average, increased by 
the difficulty of starting math courses (Table 2). ACT Math 
scores of each starting math courses were significantly different 
[F(5, 4841) = 342.4, p < 0.001]. A post-hoc test showed that 
scores are significantly different except between Applied 
Honors Calculus II and Multivariate Calculus, and Differential 
Equations (p < 0.001). Students' SAT math scores were all 
significantly different [F(5, 4286) = 225, p < 0.001]. SAT Math 
scores were significantly different except between Multivariate 
calculus and Differential Equations (p < 0.001), meaning that 
ACT or SAT math subject scores are more meaningful 
predictors than high school records for assuming students’ 
academic preparation level for engineering.

5.1.2 AP Calculus Exam Scores 
The AP Calculus exam is one way that students can show their 
proficiency in math. Depending on what kind of AP Calculus 
exam the student passes, they can waive corresponding courses 
and proceed to more advanced math course. AP Calculus AB 
(AB) is a calculus course taken after the Pre-Calculus course in 
high school. AP Calculus BC (BC) is also a calculus course, but 
covers additional topics from AB. If students have scores of AB 
(4 or 5), or 4 of BC exam, it is equivalent of Calculus I. If 
students have score of 5 from BC exam, it is equivalent of 
Calculus II. Most students who have credit from AP Calculus 
exam take Calculus II or higher courses as their first semester 
math course. Table 3 shows the success rate (percentage of 
students who received a 3.0 or better) on first semester GPA, 
graduation GPA, and starting math courses by AP Calculus 
exam scores. 
The AP scores largely determine enrollment numbers. For 
example, students with Calculus AB typically enroll in Calculus 
II and Applied Honors Calculus II, while Calculus BC students 
typically enroll in Multivariate Calculus and Differential 
Equations courses.  

Students' first semester GPA and final graduation GPA was 
significantly different by AP Calculus exam scores [F(3, 3202) 
= 124.8, p < 0.001]. A post-hoc Tukey revealed that the 
differences for semester GPA between AB and BC tests were 
significant (p < 0.01). The semester GPAs of BC 5 students 
were significantly higher than students with other AP Calculus 
scores (p < 0.01), while AB 5 and BC 4 students were not 
significantly different. A similar pattern was observed with final 
graduation GPA [F(3, 3202) = 107.6, p < 0.001], such that 

students with BC 5 scores were significantly higher than AB 4 
and BC 4 students (p < 0.01). Students scoring an AB 5 were 
not significantly different with students with a 4 or 5 on the AP 
BC exam.  

In Calculus II, the higher students scored in the AP test, the 
higher the success rates were. Students' course performance was 
significantly different by AP exam scores [F(3, 1620)=62.27, p 
< 0.001]. A post-hoc test revealed that the performance of 
students with a BC 5 score was significantly higher than other 
AP scores (p < 0.05). While the average grade of AB 5 and BC 
4 students were not significantly different, both were 
significantly different from students who scored an AB 4 (p < 
0.001). The average grades of Applied Honors Calculus II 
students were significantly different by AP exam scores [F(3, 
401) = 16.19, p < 0.001], while the over 90% of students with 
AB 5, BC 4, and BC 5 earned 3.0 or better grade. A post-hoc 
test showed that the performance of students with AB 4 was 
significantly lower than students with other AP Calculus scores 
(p < 0.001). Students in Multivariate Calculus showed 
significant difference of average grade by AP exam score [F(3, 
987) = 3.617, p < 0.05]. However, no pairs of AP exam scores 
showed significantly different results. Lastly, students in 
Differential Equations had the similar pattern as students in 
Applied Honors Calculus II. Average course grades were 
significantly different by AP exam scores [F(3, 182) = 3.855, p 
< 0.05]. Performance of students in this course with AB 4 was 
significantly lower than students with BC scores of 4 or 5.

5.2 Concurrent Course Enrollment Patterns 
Students were enrolled in 3,186 unique course combinations for 
their first semester across the 10 years in our dataset. Although 
this number is quite large, the variability of course combination 
can be abstracted based on the required courses.  

In order to declare an engineering major, every engineering 
undergraduate student needs to finish their 55 credit hours of 
core requirement courses, including chemistry, engineering, 
physics, math, and courses for intellectual breadth (courses from 
outside of the engineering college) with a minimum GPA of 2.0.  

Engineering core courses consist of Introduction to Engineering 
and Introduction to Computers and Programming. For 
chemistry, there is General Chemistry lecture, two general 
chemistry labs, and a Structure and Reactivity lecture and lab. 
Physics core courses are General Physics I lecture and lab, and 
General Physics 2 lecture and lab. Core math courses are four 
math courses: Calculus I and II, Multivariate Calculus, and 
Differential Equations. Pre-Calculus is a requirement for 
Calculus I, but it does not count as a core course. Applied 
Honors Calculus is an equivalent of Calculus II. For intellectual 
breadth, students are required to take 16 credit hours from 
outside of the engineering college. This wide range of courses 

generates copious unique combinations in concurrent course 
enrollment.  

5.2.1 Course Combination Selection Pattern 
Table 4 shows the top 5 popular course combinations for each 
first-term math course. This table explains 24.35% of total 
course combinations. Although most of engineering students’ 
course selections, especially for the first semester, are limited 
within a certain range, courses that count as intellectual breadth, 
such as Introduction to Psychology or Introduction to Sociology, 
add to the wide variety of small-percentage combinations.  
By comparing the subtotal frequencies of combinations by first-
term math courses, it can be observed that the concurrent course 
enrollment patterns are more fixed, as the level of math courses 
gets lower. Students who start with higher-level math courses 
select a wider variety of courses from core-required courses or 
others. Statistically, when comparing each pair of math courses, 
the proportion of students who take one of the top five most 
popular course combinations is significantly higher for the lower 
level math course (z > 3, p < 0.01), with the exception of the 
pairs of Calculus II-Applied Honors Calculus II and Multivariate 
Calculus and Differential Equations which are not significantly 
different.

Some courses were limited with certain groups of math courses. 
For example, popular courses for Pre-Calculus starters were 
limited to General Chemistry and Introduction to Engineering. 
Variations were made with whether taking lab courses of 
General Chemistry, and extra courses from outside of core 
requirements. For students enrolled in Calculus I, Structure and 
Reactivity, an advanced chemistry course set, and Introduction 
to Computing and Programming, which requires prior or 
concurrent enrollment in Calculus I or equivalent, were a 
popular combination. Patterns for students enrolled in Calculus 
II or higher starter groups were similar. Physics courses were 

also a popular course combination. Students in Calculus II or 
higher choose the General Chemistry set, the Structure and 
Reactivity set, or the General Physics I set. And a selection of 
Introduction to Computers and Programming is added.   

5.2.2 Performance Characteristics of Patterns 
In Table 4, the most popular course that students selected from 
outside of the core engineering courses was The Engineering 
Profession (TEP). This course is 2 credit hour seminar course 
learning about career paths as an engineer. Since the grade curve 
of this course is set high (an average grade of 3.82 (SD = 0.49)),

taking the TEP course increased students’ overall term and final 
graduation GPAs for most combinations.  

For students enrolled in Pre-Calculus, first semester GPA 
between course combinations were significantly different [F(4, 
206) = 2.968, p < 0.05]. However, taking TEP with the General 
Chemistry lecture and Introduction to Engineering did not result 
in a boost for students' semester GPA. Introduction to Sociology 
and Introduction to Psychology did not make significant 
differences either.   
The performances of Calculus I combinations were significantly 
different [F(4, 1255) = 11.5, p < 0.001]. Taking TEP course 
with Calculus I significantly increased students' semester GPA. 
Students' semester performance was significantly higher when 
taking TEP with General Chemistry lecture and lab courses and 
either one of the engineering core courses (p < 0.01).  
Calculus II combinations’ semester GPA were also significantly 
different [F(4, 759) = 2.752, p < 0.05]. However, the semester 
GPA for students enrolled in a combination of TEP, General 
Chemistry lecture and lab, and Introduction to Computers and 
Programming was not significantly higher than a combination 
without TEP. 

For Applied Honors Calculus II, combinations were not 
significantly different (F(4, 182) = 1.339, p = 0.257]. Although 
the semester GPA was significantly different for students 
enrolled in Multivariate Calculus combinations [F(4, 402) = 
3.706, p < 0.01] and Differential Equations [F(4, 90) =4.092, p 
= 0.01], no meaningful comparison of TEP between 
combination was found. 

Combinations between General Chemistry and General Physics 
I, with Introduction to Computers and Programming were not 
significantly different. Among popular combinations of Calculus 

II and Differential Equations courses, Introduction to Computers 
and Programming was concurrently taken with General 
Chemistry or General Physics I. Semester GPAs were not 
significantly different in both starting math course groups. A 
similar pattern was observed between students enrolled in 
General Chemistry and Structure and Reactivity. In Calculus I, 
Applied Honors Calculus II, and Multivariate Calculus, the most 
popular combinations included pairing the math course with 
either Introduction to Engineering or Introduction to Computers 
and Programming. Average semester GPAs were not 
significantly different for students enrolled in these three first-
term math course groups. 

5.2.3 Number of Credit and Semester Performance 
by Starting Math Courses 
Students most often take either 13 credits or 15 credits in the 
first semester. The institution considers 13-18 credits as full time 
enrollment, equating to 3-4 core courses and one non-core 
course.. Since engineering students need to complete their 
intellectual breadth requirements, many students who take more 
than 13 credits enroll in courses outside of the engineering 
college. Students who took more than 13 credit hours had 
significantly higher semester GPAs (M=3.06 vs. 2.94, SD=0.85 
vs. 0.86, t(7395.508) = 7.5383, p < 0.001). Between the math 
courses, semester GPA was significantly different [F(11, 12033) 
= 164.3, p < 0.001], except for students who took Pre-Calculus 
and Applied Honors Calculus II in their first semester (p < 
0.001) (Table 5). This finding is partially complicated. Pre-
Calculus is a required course, for students who test low on the 
mathematics placement exam, to enroll in Calculus I. However, 
Pre-Calculus enrollment does not count for financial aid 
enrollment since it does not count toward the engineering degree

completion. Thus, students with financial aid packages enrolled 
in Pre-Calculus must take at least 15 credit hours. 

5.2.4 Comparison among Core Requirement 
Courses 
As presented in section 5.2.1, concurrent course enrollment 
patterns were very complex. For example, some students did not 
take the lab courses with related lecture class in the same 
semester. Some students enrolled in more than 13 credit hours, 
and some took a variety of courses not included in the core 
engineering required courses. This complexity made it difficult 
to recognize the impact of certain courses on the first semester 
performance. However, we observed that some courses or 
course sets are rarely enrolled together in a single semester. 

Regardless of the course levels, the popular course combination 
for the first semester student was taking one course from math 
subject (12,071 out of 12,836 students enrolled in one of the 
math courses in the first semester), one from engineering 
subject, and a course set (lab and lecture courses) of either 
chemistry or physics (Table 4). Generally, this combination fills 
the minimum 13 credit hours. This analysis was conducted to 
determine which course selection gave students more benefit 
among these courses or disciplinary course set. 

A logistic regression model was built to see how the particular 
choice of core course or course set within the same subject 
category effects on students’ first semester success (whether 
they earn 3.0 or better GPA) (Table 6). Students were 
categorized by their starting math courses. In terms of chemistry 
and physics course sets, it was counted only if a student took 
both lab and lecture courses in the first semester. With this 

model, we could investigate which course or course set can be 
more beneficial to the students by their starting math courses. 
The exponential of the log odds in Table 6 represent the ratio of 
students’ proportion on being successful in comparing course 
over base course.  

Regardless of starting math course group, every course or course 
set selection had a significant impact on the first semester 
performance except one course set pair. Taking an advanced 
level course or course set within the same subject or taking a 
physics course set instead of chemistry course set gave students 
a better chance of success in their first semester (from 1.152 to 
2.465 times, p < 0.05). Taking more than 13 credit hours also 
increased the chance of success by 1.744 (p < 0.001).  
However, when the model was adapted separately by starting 
math course, only few courses or course sets showed a 
significant increase in the odd ratios. For Pre-Calculus starters, 
taking the Structure and Reactivity course set rather than the 
General Chemistry course set increased the likelihood of getting 
a semester GPA of 3.0 or better by 5.442 times (p < 0.01). For 
students who are starting with Differential Equations, taking 
Introduction to Computers and Programming, instead of 
Introduction to Engineering, increased the odds of success in the 
first semester by 2.348 times (p < 0.001). Also, students who 
took the Structure and Reactivity course set showed more 
likelihood of successful semester GPA than those who took 
General Physics I course set. Lastly, in terms of whether 
students take more than 13 credit hours in the semester, every 
starting math group showed the significant improvements if they 
took more credits, except for Pre-Calculus and Applied Honor 
Calculus II groups.

6. DISCUSSION 
6.1 Summary of Our Findings 
Our investigation described in this paper was guided by two 
overarching research questions: (1) what scholastic 
characteristics of first-year engineering students are most 
predictive of future academic success? And (2) what concurrent 
course-enrollment patterns are most predictive of academic 
success? The high correlation coefficient between first semester 
GPA and final graduation GPA indicated that first semester 
performance is very important to engineering students’ 
academic success. Thus, analyzing students’ first semester 
enrollment and success patterns is critical for developing a 
course recommendation system.  

To answer the first question, we compared high school records, 
ACT Math scores, SAT Math scores, and AP Calculus exam 
scores with students’ academic performance. We found that 
ACT Math and SAT Math scores were significantly correlated 
with first semester GPA and graduation GPA, while high school 
records only showed small correlation coefficients. Also, ACT 
Math and SAT Math scores were significantly different by 
students' starting math courses. Semester GPA and graduation 
GPA were also significantly different by AP Calculus Exam 
scores. The performance of students with AB 4, the lowest score 
to earn credit for Calculus I, in math courses were significantly 
lower than other AP scores across math courses. These results 
indicate that ACT Math, SAT Math, and AP Calculus scores 
effectively indicate the academic preparation level of freshmen 
engineering students, and can be used for predicting student 
success.  

For the second guiding research question, we observed that there 
is a greater variety of unique course combinations starting math 
course increases in difficulty level. Also, The Engineering 
Profession (TEP) survey course has relatively high average 
grade. Taking the TEP course with other core requirement 
courses were expected to boost students’ semester performance. 
However, only students who started with the Calculus I course 
benefited from TEP enrollment.  

Students who took more than the minimum 13 required credit 
hours per semester performed significantly better, except those 
who started with Pre-Calculus and Applied Honors Calculus II. 
Students with financial aid packages enrolled in Pre-Calculus 
must take at least 15 credit hours. This means that the non-
engineering requirement courses, which other students’ success 
rates benefit from, may not helping students who begin in low 
level math courses like Pre-Calculus.  

Lastly, we found that some courses or course sets affects 
students’ semester performance significantly. Among students 
who started with Pre-Calculus math course, those who took 
Structure and Reactivity course set showed higher likelihood of 
earning a 3.0 or better GPA in the first semester than students 
who started with the General Chemistry I course set. Students 
who started with Differential Equations had a higher chance of 
success when they took Introduction to Computers and 
Programming instead of Introduction to Engineering. The 
Structure and Reactivity course set also helped when compared 
to the General Physics II.  

6.2 Contribution of This Study 
This study sheds light on the importance of identifying the 
scholastic characteristics and concurrent course enrollment of 
freshmen engineering students. Both are important to help 

students achieve success in their first semester, which is very 
highly correlated with the final performance. Suggesting the 
“right” courses for students based on the incoming 
characteristics may help them achieve the academic success 
necessary for pursuing successful STEM careers and graduate 
STEM degrees. 
The findings in this paper help identify the requirements for a 
predictive model that can give insight for students and advisors 
during course registration to raise the probability of earning a 
GPA of 3.0 or better in first semester, and ultimately the 
foundation of a concurrent course recommendation system.  

For example, AP Calculus scores are better predictors of success 
in the core math courses than GPA or ACT score. So AP 
Calculus scores, when available, should be treated as the main 
factor in selecting the appropriate math course for an incoming 
freshman. 

If a student from the engineering college starts with a low-level 
math course, such as Pre-Calculus or Calculus I, the selection of 
other courses is limited since they do not meet the pre-
requirements of other courses, such as physics course sets. Also, 
students who started with Pre-Calculus showed that they do not 
benefit from taking non-required courses.   
On the other hand, students who can start in higher-level math 
courses may widen their range for course consideration. 
Students with higher AP Calculus score earned higher semester 
GPA, final graduation GPA, and starting math course 
performance. While starting in higher-level course may fulfill 
their academic curiosity and accelerate their time to degree, 
starting in relatively lower-level class can lead to solidifying the 
students’ preparation for further engineering major courses. 

6.3 Limitations 
There were some limitations of the study. First, in this initial 
investigation, there were too many variables to consider with 
limited time and resources. With more than 3,000 unique course 
combinations among first-year engineering students, analyzing 
only the most popular combinations is not enough to reveal 
every detail of concurrent course enrollment patterns. Second, 
the scope of the analysis was limited. Even though the results 
from first semester are important, it does not fully explain 
students’ future academic success or course enrollment. 
Analyses such as course taking sequences [11], or tracking the 
semester performance by incoming characteristics can be 
applied. Third, our analyses were only limited to undergraduate 
engineering students. The curriculum for engineering students is 
a relatively fixed sequence of courses. Other disciplines, both 
STEM and non-STEM such as social sciences or humanities, 
may have a much more complex structure of requirement 
courses, more numbers of unique course combinations, and 
different measurements for academic preparation that need to be 
applied. Lastly, even though the demographic information was 
not considered with the analysis of this paper, we believe that 
integrating the demographic information with incoming 
characteristics or concurrent course enrollment would be a 
worthwhile investigation. For example, the location of high 
school with AP exam results and high school GPA may be 
related, and could help improve the precision of a course 
recommendation system. However, care must be taken to ensure 
that including such information does not recreate an existing 
inequality (e.g., low female enrollment in STEM courses).  

This preliminary study mainly focused on data exploration. It 
may not answer every question that students or academic 

24



advisors may encounter or prove the causal relationship between 
the variables and students’ performance yet. Further analysis 
that considers a wider range of students with more variables 
would help to build a tool that can actually be used by an 
advisor.  

6.4 Future Research 
In future investigations, we plan to expand the scope of the 
analyses to include additional semesters and additional final 
degrees, beginning with non-engineering STEM degrees. 
Furthermore, analyzing the sequence of courses may be 
necessary for expanding the scope to additional semesters. For 
example, students may want to compare the possible outcomes 
between taking Introduction to Engineering in this semester and 
Introduction to Computers and Programming in following term, 
and vice versa. Another example can be comparing when 
students enroll in chemistry or physics lab courses non-
concurrently with the corresponding lecture course.  

Investigating when students enroll in particular courses can also 
potentially affect academic success. The time “off” between the 
fall semester and winter semester (winter vacation) is relatively 
shorter than between winter semester and fall semester (summer 
vacation). The difference in these gaps may be correlated with 
the performance of courses that are related to each other. For 
example, taking Calculus I and Calculus II in fall-winter 
semester sequence may result in a higher success rate compared 
to the case of winter-fall enrollment, since the shorter time 
between courses may increase knowledge transfer between 
courses. Also, taking courses in the summer semester may 
further increase success rates as the summer semester class may 
shorten the learning time gap that can occur during a long 
summer vacation. Particularly with students who enroll in 
courses like Pre-Calculus, it may be interesting to investigate 
differences in future academic performance controlling for 
whether students finish their required math courses more quickly 
than others. Finally, we plan to study the effect of taking courses 
at external institutions. Many students complete required core 
courses at other institutions, such as local community colleges. 
The effect of taking core required courses at other institutions 
may be related to future course performance, such as the next 
level physics course for particular engineering majors (e.g., 
Mechanical Engineering vs. Electrical Engineering).   

7. CONCLUSION 
This research is critical to not only building a course 
recommendation system, but also better supporting students 
through their chosen source of study and balancing that against 
the wealth of knowledge that the institution has at its disposal 
regarding those course selections. Providing students more 
information about details of successful characteristics may raise 
the ethical questions, such as replicating gender, ethnicity, or 
socioeconomic differences in choosing courses. But it is also 
true that students, properly scaffold, may understand those 
trends and instead leverage the prior course and student success 
history to maximize their own outcomes. As these analyses 
become easier to conduct and automate, the institution may be 
compelled to properly release these findings such that student 
success can be optimized for every student, regardless of 
demographics and incoming test scores [12].
