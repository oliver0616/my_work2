Experiments withaniterativetrainingonstandard-sized supervised (manually annotated) dataset (106 tokens) combined with a relatively modest (in the order of 108 tokens) unsupervised (plain) data in a bagging-like fashion showed signi?cant improvement of the POS classi?cation task on typologicallydifferentlanguages,yieldingbetter than state-of-the-art results for English and Czech (4.12 % and 4.86 % relative error reduction, respectively; absolute accuracies being 97.44 % and 95.89 %).

 abstract={We address the problem of predicting a word from previous words in a sample of text. In particular, we discuss n-gram models based on classes of words. We also discuss several statistical algorithms for assigning words to classes based on the frequency of their co-occurrence with other words. We find that we are able to extract classes that have the flavor of either syntactically based groupings or semantically based groupings, depending on the nature of the underlying statistics.}
