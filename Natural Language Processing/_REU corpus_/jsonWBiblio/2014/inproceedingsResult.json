This paper calls experience-based and out-of-school learning real-world learning. A typical example of real-world learning is environmental learning in nature for discov- ering forest ecology [12]. Figure 1 shows one of our field practices of environmental learning. In contrast with classroom learners in a fixed setting, real-world learners behave in a physical field (e.g., a natural environment) without restriction of movement, and so it is hard for educators to observe and assess all situations of real-world learning. A methodology for constantly monitoring and assessing intellectual activities in the world is essential for heightening the effects of real-world learning.  Mobile or ubiquitous computing technologies are rapidly advanc- ing, and new analytics realized with these technologies have the power to innovate real-world learning (e.g., support adaptive to the situation of a learner in the world). With the use of small computer devices and wearable or ubiquitous sensors, we propose a method of ubiquitous and multimodal sensing for assessing the situation of how intellectual collaboration (e.g., learner-learner interaction in a group and learner-environment interaction) proceeds through autonomous and bottom-up learning in the world.  1.1 Designing Autonomous Bottom-up Learning in the World  Traditional education in a classroom usually predefines what and how a learner should learn [1, 19]. This is because a cognitive architecture has traditionally been considered to be a closed process  1    Strange but  interesting objects exist.

Such a traditional learning design encourages learners to follow educators predefined scenarios to acquire knowledge [1]. This is a top-down approach driven by educators.  In contrast, the theory of situated cognition gives a foundation of real-world learning and suggests a bottom-up approach driven by each learner. Situated cognition explains that a learner situated in real situations in the world can often make the bottom-up acqui- sition of knowledge that can be practically used in a society [2, 10]. This theory, which postulates that a learners cognitive pro- cess is embedded in the world, proposes a cognitive architecture for acquiring knowledge through human interaction with the world [2, 10]. People generally have different viewpoints, and the diver- sity of knowledge emerges through the autonomous and bottom-up process of learning when learners interact with the world, com- municate with each other, and decide what and how they investi- gate. Navigating learners by providing predefined knowledge in a specific field (e.g., navigating visitors at a museum to observe and study objects in an art exhibition [3]) is a well-known work- able approach, but its position seems closer to traditional top-down approaches. Our challenge is designing and creating a new learner- centered environment for promoting discovery learning through au- tonomous bottom-up knowledge acquisition in the world.  1.2 Formative Assessment of Real-world Learning  It is generally known that the effect of educational support is achieved when it is properly delivered to learners according to their intellec- tual state (e.g., the level of understanding and interest). Therefore, it is fundamental to develop a method for formative assessment of learning by constantly monitoring learner activities and evaluating the intellectual situation of each learner at a given time. For ex- ample, a mini paper test in a classroom is often used to assess top-down knowledge. System use logs, test results, and reports are used for assessment by learning management systems (LMS) in a classroom [17]. Recent studies have attempted to estimate the affects (e.g., boredom, confusion, delight, or frustration) of classroom learners from sensor data (e.g., data from a fixed video camera, a pressure-sensitive mouse, and a pressure-sensitive chair) [6, 8]. However, designing a learner-centered environment for au- tonomous bottom-up learning in the world is a new challenge in the field of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), and so far the methodology to assess such real-world learning has not been well investigated.  The first difficulty is that the effects of autonomous bottom-up learn- ing cannot be measured by comparing learners achievements with predefined answers, which is the method of testing the effects of  Interest-level learning  (finding and examining knowledge seeds)  Knowledge-level   learning  (germinating knowledge seeds)  Preparatory-level learning  (exploring nature, but not finding any information)  level  Figure 3: Learning levels about finding and interpreting infor- mation in the world.  top-down education. The second difficulty is that the effects of real-world learning are derived from an outdoor experience that a learner autonomously obtains by dynamically interacting in and with the world. In other words, no methodology has been proposed to assess knowledge that comes from the interaction between learn- ers and the environment, and to carry out a real-time evaluation of the state of intellectual collaboration that changes from moment to moment in the world.  1.3 Research Objective Our research objective is to evaluate the performance of individual learners participating in collaboration activities in the real world. It is expected that the effects of bottom-up knowledge creation by learners are heightened if we can dynamically provide each real- world learner with dedicated context-aware support that is tailored to his/her state of collaboration. Context estimation (e.g., place of interest, learning topics, unachieved knowledge, and tendency of viewpoint) of a real-world learner is conventionally an unsolved issue. We consider this issue in this study so that we can create a learner-centered environment for strengthening and enhancing a learners interest and viewpoint and for promoting effective learner- learner interaction and learner-environment interaction. Thus, we propose a new method to systematically grasp the human-world dynamics through which intelligence emerges and to formatively assess the situation of a real-world learner at a given time.  The type of learning considered in this paper is exploratory learn- ing in which individuals in an environment interact and collabo- rate with their surroundings and achieve knowledge. Since human- world interaction is the essential key to directly cause learning ef- fects, our method mainly focuses on improving the human-world interaction of each individual learner. Our method is a basic assess- ment method for realizing computer-based support for exploratory learning that is interactively and collaboratively made between peo- ple and the world, and is an important contribution in the field of new analytics enhanced with mobile and ubiquitous computing.  2. ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK As stated above, an approach for estimating the situation of a real- world learner at a given time has not been well researched. Conse- quently, the first argument we have to make concerns the distinctive characteristics of real-world learning. As shown in Figure 2, real- world learning is driven by field activities for searching and dis- covering physical information existing in the world [14]. Such real-world information can be regarded as a knowledge seed [14]. A learner visits a certain location in the world and explores and searches for information as the stage of preparatory-level learning  2    prior knowledge  stable  stay  Estimation by signal processing  Estimation by information integration  2D  location  head  posture  body  posture  LPS  place of  interest  barometer  learning  topic  acceler  -ometer gyroscope  Usage as context information  Intellectual states  GPS  Adaptive and context-aware learning support  unachieved  knowledge  spatial  characteristics   of information  Low-level sensing  Physical  situation  tendency of  viewpoint  Component 1  Component 2  Component 3  2D locating  behavior  Information access behavior  3D focusing  behavior  probing  behavior  Recognition by machine learning algorithm Content and process of   internal situation  activity  map  field  notes audio-visual   recorder  Knowledge   sensing  Experience  capture  interest   acquisition  knowledge  acquisition  learning  achievements  enencecece  Local Positioning System (LPS)   Hybrid motion sensor      Wearable camera & microphone  Microphone  Eye cameraData   storage  LPS GPS   receiver  Example of wearable-type  sensor sets  a 3-axis accelerometer,  a 3-axis gyroscope,  and a barometer  Figure 4: Method for assessing the situation of intellectual ac- tivities in the world.  (Figure 3). When the learner finds information of his/her interest, this learner starts interest-level learning to examine the nature of the information. Interest-level learning can trigger higher knowledge- level learning (Figure 3). When he/she successfully examines and interprets the information, knowledge is then constructed by the learner as a mental model of the environment functions [14]. When the learner fails in the examination or interpretation of the informa- tion, he/she cannot achieve knowledge.  Real-world learners use their body to interact with their surround- ings and to obtain information in the world. A real-world learners body functions as a sensor for obtaining information about the real world and also functions as an actuator for manipulating the world (Figure 2). We focus on both the role of the real world (viewpoint 1) and the behavior of a learner in the world (viewpoint 2).  Viewpoint 1. The role of the real world What a learner can learn in the world depends on what infor- mation is embedded around his/her location. Some locations in a learning field have valuable observation targets, but some locations do not. If we know the spatial characteristics of a learning field, in other words, if we know what intellectual activities are drawn out at each location in the field, we can narrow down the learning situation that can occur at each lo- cation. Thus, we need to develop a technique for extracting the spatial characteristics of a real-world learning field.  Viewpoint 2. The behavior of a learner in the world What a learner can learn in the world depends on his/her be- havior, as well as his/her surrounding information. For ex- ample, Figure 2 shows a location with discovery knowledge, where strange but interesting objects (e.g., aerial roots of a plant) exist on the ground. Just visiting this location without sufficient observation is not enough for a learner to discover the nature of the strange objects, and so appropriate behavior  becomes indispensable. A real-world learner interacts with the world, selects from a range of possible actions, and then executes an action. The final output of thinking is behavior, and the intellectual state of a real-world learner is to some extent physically reflected by their body. It is not possible to directly observe the internal state of the learners brain, but his/her physical interaction with the world can be observed from outside, and the differences of behavior can be a clue to understanding learning situations. For understanding a learn- ing situation, we need to develop a technology to grasp a learners body-based behavior for accessing the information embedded in the world.  The central topic discussed in this paper is how we can systemat- ically integrate the elements of knowledge, behavior, and the en- vironment for assessing real-world learners situations. This is an issue of finding a way to combine heterogeneous factors: learners internal situations, their external situations, and their real-world learning field. Here, we consider the following three requirements for assessing real-world learning situations. Requirements 1, 2, and 3 were developed as components 1, 2, and 3 of our assessment method, respectively (Figure 4).  Requirement 1. Development of an externalization method of interests and knowledge to grasp the internal situation It is necessary to develop a method that encourages each learner to externalize new information and knowledge gained as the result of real-world learning, and to show the process and contents of internal intellectual activities (e.g., thinking and knowledge acquisition). With such a method, it is nec- essary to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the intel- lectual process of how each intellectual activity draws out intellectual achievements (e.g., a hypothesis, a question, or a discovery) from each learner. Then, it is necessary to extract the spatial relationship of how information and knowledge that a learner can obtain in the world are related to the envi- ronment where he/she exists. In this research, requirement 1 was satisfied by developing component 1 with the technique of knowledge externalization with a semantic network, ex- perience capturing with wearable audio-visual sensors, and a spatial analysis.  Requirement 2. Development of a sensing method of time-series behavior to grasp the external situation It is necessary to have a detailed understanding of the phe- nomena occurring in a learning field. The differences of be- havior observable from outside a learner can be a clue to un- derstanding learning situations. Thus, we need to investigate how learning behavior is related to the intellectual situation, and we need to find what learning behavior is displayed dur- ing a certain learning situation of real-world learning. We need to watch every behavior of a learner to trace the entire time series of a learners physical behavior in accessing in- formation in the world. In this research, requirement 2 was satisfied by developing component 2 through behavior sens- ing by multimodal motion sensors and recognizing behavior by signal processing and machine learning.  Requirement 3. Development of a spatial integration method of internal and external situations Evaluations of both the learners internal and external situ- ations are qualitatively different, and can complementarily explain a phenomenon in a learning field. Thus, it is nec- essary to integrate these two evaluation results and to form  3    an understanding of how knowledge, behavior, and the envi- ronment are related. For example, it is necessary to spatially summarize the situation of past intellectual activities (e.g., acquisition of interests and knowledge) in the world to make a spatial pattern of knowledge acquisition activities, and to extract the spatial characteristics of how information is dis- tributed in a learning field. Then, it is necessary to under- stand the state of real-world learning at a high level of ab- straction (e.g., topics of interest, unachieved knowledge, and tendency of viewpoints). The various context information es- timated by our method acts as the core for realizing context- aware learning support adapted to the interest, knowledge, and viewpoint of each learner. In this research, requirement 3 was satisfied by developing component 3 with information integration techniques.  The rapid progress being made in engineering technologies has led to new ways of innovating learning support. Our intention is not to select engineering technologies that fit conventional method- ologies, nor to replace old educational tools with new ones. Our method is for educators and system designers who want to design and create an effective methodology of future learning support that can be embodied only by using the innovations of computational devices and sensing technologies in a real-world environment.  3. STRUCTURING 3D INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION  As component 1, we developed a technology to observe the inter- est and the knowledge that a learner obtains in a field and used this technology to consider the spatial structure of information distribu- tion in a real-world learning field.  3.1 Capturing and Analyzing Real-world Learning Experiences  To model the role of a real-world learning field, we developed a technique to grasp the process and contents of information acquisi- tion and knowledge acquisition. In our example of outdoor learn- ing, each learner is equipped with a wearable camera (on his/her head) and a microphone (at his/her mouth) to record his/her vision and utterances (Figure 4). This makes it possible to know exactly where the learners are looking and finding or not finding real-world information. The learners behavior and communication are also recorded with video cameras operated or set by the observers. Dur- ing outdoor learning, each learner is asked to take field notes of what he/she is interested in so that we can grasp the information found by each group.  Among the various definitions of knowledge, we consider knowl- edge acquisition as structuring the internal representation of a se- mantic network between different concepts (information) [14]. A conventional concept map [13] is widely used for structuring peo- ples knowledge, but when we used it for our research purposes, we found that a conventional concept map was hard to use for distin- guishing newly acquired knowledge from a learners background knowledge and for clearly identifying the contents and process of real-world learning [14]. Thus, we improved the knowledge repre- sentation of a conventional concept map by developing an activity map to objectively externalize the content and process of his/her knowledge acquisition [14].  Immediately after the outdoor learning, each learner is requested to draw an activity map (Figure 5) to express the semantic structure of  Attribute information of  knowledge or an activity  Attributes:  - example  - general knowledge  - question  - hypothesis  - observation  - verification  - discovery  (defined from 90 learners experiments)  Figure 5: Activity map with semantic network.  the information and knowledge that he/she newly acquired by the outdoor learning [14]. A node in an activity map is used to write information that a learner found. Each arc is used to express the semantic relationship between information that the learner found. Unlike a conventional concept map [13], a node and an arc in an ac- tivity map can be expressed with a single word or phrase in natural language. Moreover, we examined field notes written by 90 learn- ers in our past experiments and designed attribute information that identified the activity from which a learner found the relationship [14]. The attribute information can be added to each arc and con- sists of the following: example of a concept, general knowledge (a learners background knowledge), question, hypothesis to explain the relationship between concepts, observation of a phenomenon in the world carefully watched for a period of time, verification (be- havior to examine and verify the hypothesis), and discovery. The granularity of each attribute information was set at a level that the learners were able to consistently judge. We used free software1 to draw an activity map.  A learners field notes show his/her interests, and the activity map of the learner shows the knowledge that he/she acquired. We syn- chronously replay all multiview audio-visual records (e.g., from learners wearable cameras and microphones, and experimenters hand-held cameras) to correlate the topic and level of intellectual activity at each time point with the results of the learners knowl- edge externalization. When the content that a learner deals with at a certain point of time is what he/she externalized in his/her field notes, the learning at this time point is regarded as learning con- tributing to obtaining real-world information or learning for ex- amining the nature of real-world information (i.e., interest-level learning; Figure 3). Similarly, when the content is properly exter- nalized in the learners activity map, the learning at this time point is regarded as learning contributing to constructing understanding by interpreting real-world information or learning for examin- ing newly constructed knowledge (i.e., knowledge-level learning; Figure 3). When the content does not meet the requirements of interest-level learning or knowledge-level learning, the learning at this time point is regarded as preparatory-level learning (Figure 3).  3.2 2D Dependence of Learning Topics 1Reflective mapper Ando-Kun, http://www2.kobe-u.ac. jp/~inagakis/undo.html  4    Figure 6: 3D change of learners postures according to learning topics being considered.  We conducted experiments with 15 learners in Kamigamo Exper- imental Forest, Kyoto University in 2010 and investigated the re- lationship between learning topics and locations by dividing the experimental field (130 x 50 m) into 80 regions (10 x 10 m grid) in a two-dimensional (2D) plane. These learners had not visited our experimental field beforehand and so did not have any prior knowledge of the field.  We determined the learning topics examined by the learners by cap- turing and analyzing learning experiences, as described in the pre- vious section. The learners considered various topics (142 topics total), but the learning topics tended to depend on the learners lo- cation. On average, each topic was considered in 1.71 regions, and 2.16 topics were considered per region. What is learned in a field is closely related to the position of the learner, which illustrates the uniqueness of the physical information in each region. These experiments confirmed that the range of learning topics can be nar- rowed down based on the 2D location.  3.3 3D Existence of Real-world Information The learning topics that can be examined are region dependent. Thus, 2D positional information limits the range of the situation of the learner and narrows down possible learning topics that can be examined at his/her location. However, in regions where more than one learning topic exists, 2D location information is insuf- ficient to uniquely identify the topic of interest that a learner is examining. Therefore, additional information is required to deter- mine the learner context. We note that a natural ecosystem gener- ally has a multi-layered hierarchy. As shown in Figure 6, learners behave differently even if they stay in the same location. They sometimes look up and sometimes crouch down, and their posture changes according to the learning topics that they are considering. We therefore performed a 3D classification of the learning topics to be learned in the experiment. We found the tendency that the top- ics were not only region dependent in 2D but also height dependent, and were related to the following three layers:  (1) Upper layer: Objects above the level of the learners heads (e.g., tall trees, branches and leaves, and light sources). The learn- ing topics related to this layer are usually examined when a learner is looking up.  (2) Middle layer: Objects at eye level (e.g., tree trunks and shrubs). The learning topics related to this layer are usually examined when a learner is looking straight ahead.  (3) Lower layer: Objects at ground level (e.g., mushrooms, moss, soil, undergrowth, aerial roots, mountain streams, and ponds). The learning topics related to this layer are usually examined when a learner is looking down or crouching down.  What a learner examines depends on the 2D region, and each 2D region offers only a small number of topics. Moreover, this re- search also found that each layer of an ecosystem contains different information, and height is therefore another factor influencing the knowledge that a learner can acquire. Even if more than one topic occurs in the same region, we found that height information is use- ful for distinguishing such topics. If the learning topics cannot be distinguished in a 2D space, it is possible to distinguish them in a higher 3D space.  4. 3D ESTIMATION OF INFORMATION ACCESS BEHAVIOR  As component 2, we developed sensing technologies to determine the time series of learning that occurs in the world. These technolo- gies recognize a learners 3D behavior for accessing and acquiring information embedded in the world.  4.1 Estimating Time-series Probing Behavior 4.1.1 Probing Behavior  Two types of behavior can be found in environmental learning: be- havior effective for learning, and behavior ineffective for learning [12, 15]. Behavior effective for learning includes observation (e.g., visual inspection and examination by touch), knowledge exchange (e.g., cooperative thinking and discussion), and intellectual investi- gation (e.g., cooperative thinking and discussion through a collab- orative field survey). This type of behavior, which accesses and ac- quires real-world information, is called probing behavior in this paper. As discussed, probing behavior at each time point is at one of the three levels about how a learner is finding and interpreting information in the world (Figure 3). On the other hand, behavior ineffective for learning includes trivial chat, idle talk, lack of ob- servation, lack of conversation, and rest. This paper calls this type of behavior non-probing behavior.  4.1.2 Relationship between Intellectual Situations and Behavior  Although human behavior can be estimated from sensor data [9, 11, 21, 22], it is conventionally difficult to estimate the intellec- tual state of a learner by using sensors. To begin with, sensors are devices for measuring physical quantities (e.g., velocity, acceler- ation, angular velocity, and signal strength) associated with body movement. A typical example of behavior sensing is identifying the location of humans at a given time [21]. Other examples in- clude recognition of daily activities (e.g., walking and ascending stairs) [11], and abnormal activities (e.g., slipping on a wet floor) [22]. This has recently been extended to the ability to sense human activities by using consumer devices such as mobile phones [9]. However, few studies have attempted to determine the relationship between the physical behavior and the intellectual state of humans. Hence, even if we measure real-world activities using sensors, it is quite difficult to infer the internal intellectual state of the learner. Thus, we conducted field surveys to investigate how intellectual sit- uations are accompanied by physical behavior in the world. Then, we obtained the following significant results [15].  (1) When learners walk inattentively in an environment, they rarely have enthusiastic discussions and obtain only superficial informa- tion about the environment.  (2) When learners engage in probing behavior (e.g., observation, knowledge exchange, and intellectual investigation), they display  5    a characteristic physical motion. We call this motion stable stay. Stable stay is defined as a condition that extends for Tt [sec] or more, during which a fixed body posture is adopted (horizontal an- gular rotation of T [deg/sec] or less) and movement is restricted to a velocity of Tv [m/sec] or less. Stable stay includes the state of crouching down.  (3) When learners are not focused on a specific learning topic and casually look around, their body orientation in the horizontal plane is not fixed, even if they are not walking.  4.1.3 Recognizing Probing Behavior by Sensing Stable Stay  Learners exhibit a wide variety of behaviors, such as looking at various parts of the environment, touching objects at various points with their hands, and observing objects while crouching down. How- ever, whatever each learner actually notices, observes, or investi- gates, stable stay is commonly displayed when probing behavior is performed. In fact, under stable stay conditions, the possibility that probing behavior occurred was found to be 3.12 times higher than that under other conditions [15]. This is an important finding concerning the common structure of diverse learning activities.  On the premise that probing behavior and stable stay conditions frequently co-occur [15], each learner was given a wearable local positioning system (LPS, 255 g, 111 x 82 x 39 mm; Figure 4) to be placed on their lower back in order to capture the local move- ment and body orientation of the learner. The time series of probing behavior was determined by detecting stable stay conditions from the LPS data with three threshold parameters (Tt = 15.00 [sec], Tv = 0.10 [m/sec], T = 60.00 [deg/sec]). These values were deter- mined by pre-evaluating sensor data for experimental learners and inspecting the data distribution of physical movements associated with both probing behavior and non-probing behavior. The data for these learners were not used in the subsequent experiments for evaluating the recognition accuracy.  We carefully specified the contents and levels of learning at a cer- tain time point by referring to multiview audio-visual records (e.g., from learners wearable cameras and microphones, and from ex- perimenters hand-held cameras) and made the ground-truth data of the series occurrence of learning activities (time precision: second order). Then, we evaluated the accuracy of the recognition tech- nology by using the ground-truth data for the time series of stable stay and probing behavior (18,000 sec; data for five groups repre- senting 15 learners). Our technique extracted data for 7,787 sec as candidates of probing behavior, and among these data, 6,786 sec correctly matched the ground-truth data. Thus, we confirmed that the technology could accurately recognize the time when probing behavior occurred (precision = 87.1%) by automatically analyzing the LPS data of the learners [15].  Knowledge exchange and intellectual investigation are the states of group collaboration based on the interaction between learners. With our sensing technique, we were able to estimate such group collaboration by individually sensing each person who participated in the collaboration.  4.2 3D Determination of Target of Interests By sensing stable stay conditions, an accurate real-time estimation can be made of how probing behavior occurs in a learning field. Moreover, by tracing the location of a learner with a GPS receiver,  walking pace  Tv [m/sec]  horizontal body   orientation  T [deg/sec] duration  Tt [sec].....................  3D posture during the stable stay  looking  straight  head height 1  looking  up  crouching  down  head height 2  head  posture  body posture  stable stay  Figure 7: Estimating 3D posture during the state of stable stay.  both the 2D locations of interest and the time spent engaged in probing behavior can be determined. Because this is an advanced technology, it is still difficult to estimate what the learner actually learns in the world. By identifying the targets on which probing be- havior is focused, we hope to clarify the associated content and the knowledge acquisition process. Stable stay is defined in a horizon- tal 2D plane and can be used for robust identification of probing behavior. As shown in Figure 6, the postures of learners reflect their interests at that time. In this research, we therefore extended the technique for recognizing stable stay behavior to also identify the posture involved (Figure 7), thus allowing the 3D position of the topic of interest to be determined.  An eye-mark recorder is conventionally used to track the gaze di- rection of a person. However, because current eye-mark recorders are large and heavy, they restrict the movement of a learner in the world. Furthermore, when a learner moves, his/her location and head direction constantly change without constraint. This makes it difficult to use data from an eye-mark recorder for automatic de- termination of what is being observed. Here, we trace the head direction instead of eye movement, because it is known that head direction and gaze direction are closely related, and head direction can be substituted for gaze direction [20]. For example, as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, to observe objects at ground level, learners need to crouch or bend their head down. A learner who is crouching down has a different head height from one who is standing upright (Figure 7). Thus, this paper proposes an idea to classify a learners posture (e.g., looking straight ahead, looking up, looking down, or crouching down) based on head height, head tilt, and body tilt. In this method, we provide each learner with wearable-type hybrid motion sensors (shown in Figure 4) for the head and body, in addi- tion to an LPS for the lower back and a GPS receiver for the head. The hybrid motion sensor (22 g, 37 x 46 x 12 mm) has a 3-axis ac- celerometer (50 Hz), a 3-axis gyroscope (50 Hz), and a barometer (25 Hz) built in. The accelerometers obtain 3D tilt information, and the barometer obtains height information. The gyroscopes obtain 3D information about the rotation of a learners body and head.  Preliminary evaluation of sensor data was done to test our assump- tion for designing a classifier for recognizing body posture, and the evaluation found the typical characteristics of sensor data as- sociated with each target posture [16]. For a detailed analysis, in this paper, we further investigated the data obtained in experiments with 33 adult learners at Kamigamo Experimental Forest in 2009  6    and 2010. When learners stood upright and were looking straight ahead, the output from the vertical axes of the accelerometers at- tached on the body and the head almost equaled the gravitational acceleration (1000 mG). In contrast, when the body and head of a learner were tilted, the accelerometers also tilted and the gravita- tional acceleration was properly split into two or three components. The experiments also showed that the sensor data exhibited differ- ent characteristics for each of the target behaviors (e.g., looking up, standing upright, and crouching down). We also examined actual behavior of the learners at the experiments by manually checking video records. Then, we found that the information of acceleration, angular velocity, and height is useful for determining the posture of a learners head and body. Moreover, although noise reduction is a basic problem of signal processing, these experiments showed that sensor data noise caused by the learners movement is considerably reduced during the state of stable stay. We found that this is a merit for robust pattern classification of learner behavior. For implement- ing a posture identification technique, the integration of multimodal sensor data is carried out by a support vector machine (SVM). Our signal processing is implemented to be done in real time to realize real-time learning support according to learner situations.  5. FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT BY SPATIO- TEMPORAL BEHAVIOR INFORMATION  Our method consists of three key elements formed by components 1, 2, and 3: knowledge, behavior, and the environment. First, our research on component 1 showed that knowledge and topics that can be learned in a real-world learning field are three-dimensionally dependent, although a wide variety of intellectual activities occur there. We showed that each region in the horizontal plane offers only a small number of topics, and each layer in the vertical direc- tion of an ecosystem promotes the acquisition of different knowl- edge. Second, component 2 was developed by focusing on the 3D role of a learners body as an interactive medium for obtain- ing real-world information from his/her surroundings. We found the time series of probing behavior can be precisely estimated by determining a characteristic stay behavior (i.e., stable stay) that fre- quently occurs during the state of probing behavior. Importantly, the ground-truth data from audio-visual records of learning activ- ities showed that a learner in a group rarely did stable stay when learner collaboration in his/her group did not actively function. It follows from this that the occurrence estimation of stable stay pro- vides us not only with an index to evaluate the activity of each individual learner at a given time, but also with an index to evalu- ate the activities made by the learners group at that time. We also confirmed the possibility that the 3D position of a learners focus can be identified by sensing and determining a learners 3D posture that is involved in the state of stable stay.  However, we should point out that it is hard to estimate real-world contexts in which learners are involved if we do not systematically integrate world characteristics (e.g., spatial distribution of real-world information) and human behavior. Behavior-based context estima- tion alone is not enough for our purpose, even if we determine the occurrence of probing behavior and 3D spatial placement of the learners focus. Diversity and the effects of discovery learning emerge in the process of learners bottom-up knowledge processing based on their own interests. But without the data of spatial infor- mation distribution in a field, it is hard to estimate the information that a learner actually accesses or does not access. Similarly, it is not possible to consider the spatial contexts around a learner, such as the difficulty of knowledge acquisition at his/her current loca- tion.  23  34   6  14  22  33  47   5  13  32  46  59   4  12  31  45  58   3  11  21  44  57  69   2  10  20  43  56  68   1   9  19  30  42  55  67   8  18  29  41  54  66  76    7   17  28  40  53  65  75  16  27  39  52  64  74  15  26  38  51  63  73  25  37  50  62  72  80  24  36  49  61  71  79  35  48  60  70  77  Area for learning (each grid: 10x10 m)  Location with information that is hard to understand  7877  7672  50 51 5248  42 44 45  12  20  26 29  Figure 8: Difficulty of knowledge acquisition at each location.  5.1 Extracting Spatial Characteristics of a Field As component 3, we integrate the heterogeneous elements of knowl- edge, behavior, and the environment, and summarize the spatiotem- poral occurrence of learning activities in a field for systematically understanding real-world learning situations.  5.1.1 3D Spatial Characteristics of a Learning Field By analyzing 15 learners data in our experimental field in 2010, we found that a different quality of information exists at each location in a field [15]. For example, we found the locations where learners casually passed through without staying (26 regions of 80 regions; 32.5%). We also found the locations where probing behavior and interest level occurred for a long period of time, but knowledge- level learning hardly occurred. In Figure 8, 15 regions (18.8%) are such locations, where learners had acute interests, actively tried to obtain information through observation or investigation, but did not successfully understand the nature of the information. 2D clas- sification of a field from the time amount of learning activities at each location showed that the value of each location in a field is not equal. This classification extracted important locations that have discovery knowledge that is hard to understand, even if learners en- thusiastically make an observation, an investigation, and a discus- sion. This is a basic result showing that our method can illustrate learning situations involving a learner in the world.  Furthermore, as an advantage of our method, the above classifica- tion technique can be three-dimensionally extended to better ex- plain real-world spatial characteristics. For example, information distribution inherent in each 3D region in a learning field can be extracted by using our sensing technologies for 3D measurement of learner behavior and 3D determination of a learners focus in the world. Such 3D spatial characteristics of a field can be used as prior knowledge for determining the situation where learners fo- cusing on each 3D location are expected to be involved. In other words, this extended technique makes it possible to express the 3D spatial contexts around a learner, for example, from the difficulty of knowledge acquisition at the 3D location of his/her current interest.  5.1.2 Probabilistic Spatial Modeling Based on Learn- ing Processes  The result of learning is achieved through the process of a chain of activities from the past to the present. In the case that learners failed in knowledge acquisition at a location, it is expected that the process of their activities had some problems. The analysis shown in the previous subsection was a method to show the result of learning at each location (e.g., whether learners understood infor- mation at each location), and is useful to predict the result in how  7    learning at each location tends to end.  As an advantage of our method, we can identify the problematic learning processes that posed obstacles to knowledge development and then structure a field including the process of learning at each location. We can make a location-based model explaining how in- dividual learning activities (i.e., points in time) made a time-series sequential chain (i.e., lines, or a network) and promoted intellectual achievements. For example, the multimodal techniques discussed in this paper can be used to track the sequence and co-occurrence of behavior and each level of learning at each location, to find patterns of learning activities inherent at each location, and to extract struc- tural problems in the chain or transition of learning activities. This makes it possible to calculate the probabilistic structure of the oc- currence and transition of learning situations in a field, including, for example, the probability of acquiring and developing knowl- edge at each location based on the probability that preparatory-level learning at a location failed to promote interest-level learning or knowledge-level learning.  5.2 Process of Assessing Real-world Learning Discovery learning in a bottom-up style should be autonomously driven by learners, not by educators. However, such bottom-up learning does not necessarily mean learning without the aid of ed- ucational support. When bottom-up learning is deadlocked, small hints (not answers) are helpful for encouraging learners to do prospec- tive activities for breaking the deadlock. Here, how and when should learning support be given to learners in the world Needless to say, it is not our position to one-sidedly provide definite and cor- rect answers with learners in a top-down style because this will not promote the learners autonomy. In our position, the necessity of learning support needs to be determined by considering what activ- ities learners are autonomously doing or not doing. Similarly, the delivery of learning support needs to be driven by considering the state of bottom-up knowledge acquisition in the world.  In conventional studies, few approaches have been proposed about how to systematically understand the intellectual state of learners interacting with and in the world. As component 3 in Figure 4 shows, we can integrate the recognition results of 3D behavior in a region in a field with the 3D spatial characteristics of the region and then form an understanding of learning situations at a given time at a high level of abstraction. Real-time data processing (e.g., signal processing and information retrieval) is mainly designed to run on a Java software environment as a client service of a mobile computer with ubiquitous sensors, so that a learner in the world can acquire the services of adaptive learning support. At the first system boot, a local client is designed to access the server database that stores the spatial characteristics of the field (spatial index database), to make a local copy of the database, and to use the local copy for efficient information retrieval.  Our method gives us knowledge on specific objects and informa- tion that are potentially effective in a learning field. Although such knowledge can be used in top-down education, our scaffolding of learning, based on learners autonomy, is intended to avoid unnec- essary intervention in learners activities. Learners autonomous activities observed with our method are used as service triggers for driving context-aware learning support to encourage bottom-up knowledge acquisition in the world.  Let us assume that learners stay at a location with discovery knowl- edge (Figure 2) and examine the aerial roots of a plant on the  ground while crouching down. The following is an example of estimating such a situation by using the 3D spatial contexts of the world.  (1) Real-world behavior of a learner is measured and estimated with wearable sensors. GPS information shows the 2D stay location of a learner at a given time. The 3D location of the target of his/her interest or consciousness is determined by sensing his/her 3D pos- ture during the state of stable stay. In this example, the posture of crouching down is estimated and shows that the learner notices the lower layer of the ecosystem and that he/she is examining learning objects inherent at this layer as the current learning topic.  (2) Queries are sent to the spatial index database (local database) by using these recognition results as reference keys. A learners 2D location at a given time limits the range of potential learning contents that can be examined at his/her location. In this example, the database answers several possible topics, including the topic of aerial roots of a plant on the ground. The 3D location of the learners focus determines the topic that can be studied by focusing on each layer. Learners can examine several topics at the location, but, in this case, the estimation result shows the situation that the learner in the world is examining aerial roots on the ground as the main topic. At the same time, the characteristics of each topic can be known by referring to the spatial index database, and we can estimate the features (e.g., difficulty of knowledge acquisition) of the learning topic that the learner is examining.  Various context information estimated by our method acts as the core for realizing context-aware learning support adapted to the in- terest and viewpoint of each learner. For example, if a learner ca- sually passed through an important location with abundant discov- ery knowledge without doing a suitable amount of stable stay, the learner was probably unaware of the interest, values, and wonder of the location. Or, if a learner did stable stay but did not carefully watch the layer where information was embedded, he/she failed to find the seeds of discovery knowledge as a topic of observation or discussion. In these cases, our estimation method regards the learners observation, investigation, and discussion as insufficient. Estimation with our method identifies 3D locations where knowl- edge has not yet been achieved and determines important learning objects whose existence is overlooked or whose value is not dis- covered. Then, learners are encouraged to study at the locations that are interesting but difficult for achieving knowledge, and are encouraged to be aware of potential information that should be ex- amined. As another example, by extracting the locations where a small number of learners did very active learning, we can find the locations that only sensitive and keen learners can notice. Learn- ers are encouraged to visit such important locations and to acquire the discovery knowledge there. Furthermore, by considering prob- lematic situations that tend to occur at each location, appropriate support can be provided to learners. These supports do not aim at top-down educational support for giving learners concrete answers. Instead, these supports aim at bottom-up learning support for di- recting learners attention to potential information in the world and for drawing out prospective activities to approach an answer and autonomously make discovery in the world. The timing and the frequency of these supports can be tuned according to the strategy of bottom-up learning.  This research considered integrating components 1, 2, and 3 as a unified and systematical assessment method for real-time CSCL applications. The evaluation results of each component show the  8    basic performance of our technologies for context-aware and adap- tive real-time support for real-world learning, such as the deter- mination of spatial contexts that learners at each location are ex- pected to be involved in. An important contribution of this pa- per is our proposed new method for real-time formative assessment of various high-level situations of intellectual collaboration chang- ing from moment to moment in the world. Our method integrates both the distribution structure of real-world information and the hu- man real-world interaction. An advantage of our method is that we showed a method to generate many indexes to systematically un- derstand real-world learning situations. For example, the duration of stable stay about a certain target can be used as an index of the intensity of a learners interest in the target, and an index of the intensity of collaboration in his/her group. The tendency of the time series and the spatial change of topics in which a learner is interested and learns in the world is an index to understand the viewpoints from which the learner grasps and examines real-world problems. Our method realizes a new way to objectively grasp the direction of his/her interest, thinking, and learning activities. Our method focuses on each of the diverse learning activities and serves to strengthen and enlarge the interest of each learner. This draws out new viewpoints and learning activities from each learner and promotes his/her discovery activities. Consequently, it is possible to promote active collaboration between learners in a group activ- ity, and to help the bottom-up emergence of new knowledge from real-world collaboration. Our method is a type of methodology that is not proposed by conventional studies and is valuable for the inno- vation of collaboration support technologies in real-world settings.  5.3 Extensibility of the Method An effective learning environment can be formatively designed by making a field practice, getting feedback from the practice, and re- fining the design principle [4]. Our method is designed so that it can be flexibly extended. For example, when system designers want to use sensors installed in the environment, sensing information from such environmental sensors can be incorporated into the component 2 functions of our method. When system designers find behaviors that are complementarily useful for identifying learning situations, they can add new behavior-estimation engines to component 2 and improve the granularity and coverage of learners context that the method deals with. For example, recent social science has shown that a body condition called body torque (i.e., the condition that only a persons upper body twists independently of his/her lower body) is displayed when a person is inactively and subordinately involved in an activity [18]. By adopting such research results from behavior science, it is possible to estimate that a learner who si- multaneously displays both stable stay and body torque at a given time is in the state of probing behavior, but his/her interaction with the world is not so active. As illustrated by this example, context-aware CSCL services with our method are improved by better scientific understanding of human behavior. Similarly, com- ponent 1 can be replaced according to developments of knowledge science, and component 3 can be replaced by an information inte- gration method such as probabilistic reasoning algorithms. This pa- per looked at the future extension of context estimation techniques adapted to various demands and possible advances in research and proposed a basic method to systematically and flexibly grasp situa- tions in real-world learning.  5.4 Future Work Our research made it possible to automatically estimate not only the occurrence of important learning but also the 3D target of interest by examining the sensor data of learners physical behavior. Our  future work includes simplifying the labor of other processes of the analysis. If we enable a learner in the world to make a digital memo (automatically time-stamped) with a portable device, then we can record the time-series process of acquiring knowledge seeds in the world. This is technically easy and would reduce the work of gen- erating the time-series occurrence data of learning activities. More- over, conventional research suggests that it is possible to automat- ically estimate the detailed structure of a semantic network if the network is written with simple sentences and obviously describes the co-reference information [7]. These techniques are expected to simplify and automate the analysis of the activity map.  Our method was applied to autonomous bottom-up learning in the world without forcing real-world learners to follow predefined sce- narios or viewpoints to explore a field. In general, each individual differently grasps and interprets the world according to his/her own schema. An important point is that our spatial indexing technique integrated the different results of such spatial recognition. In the future, we will conduct larger-scale experiments with more partici- pants to further investigate the applicability of our method. Our fu- ture work includes verifying learning effects achieved by our new approach to real-world learning. It is valuable to take more con- sideration of the relationship between real-world interpretation and peoples subjective views, and to apply our method to people from different cultures and different domains (e.g., learning in museums and learning in the sea). Our method mainly focused on human- world interaction for interactively acquiring knowledge from the world. Future work should consider integrating the social elements of human-human interaction that include, for example, the dynamic development of collaboration policies in group learning.  Our method is designed for a real-world field in which the occur- rence of behavior can be structured according to location, and we should consider how our method is applicable to other fields. Since our method focused on behavior externalized outside of a learner, it is not designed for tracing internally hidden mental states such as silent reflection inside a learner. The method has these limitations, but, as potential application fields of our method, we can find many real-world fields in which the occurrence of behavior is restricted by location, and situations at such fields are expected to be deter- mined from the information of behavior and location. For example, areas in an office have functions associated with a certain physical behavior (e.g., corridors for walking, places for doing desk work, and places for taking a break by sitting in a chair) [5]. Similarly, at a hospital, different rooms are assigned for doing certain behaviors (e.g., rooms for doctor consultations, rooms for performing medi- cal operations, and rooms for staff meetings). Automatic tracing of business procedures at such real-world fields is a potential advan- tage for labor management and optimization of human resources. Our proposed basic ideas and analysis techniques will be applica- ble to the investigations of the tendency of the spatial occurrence of collaboration in other real-world fields. Therefore, it is an im- portant theme of the future to accumulate practical knowledge in various real-world fields by using our method.  6. CONCLUSIONS Our challenge is designing and creating a new learner-centered en- vironment for promoting discovery learning through autonomous bottom-up knowledge acquisition in the world. Automatic assess- ment of a learning activity is the base for effective learning support, but, unlike classroom learning, the methodology to formatively as- sess autonomous bottom-up learning in the world has not yet been well investigated. The main difficulty in the assessment is the lack  9    of a methodology to measure, grasp, and summarize the learning experience that a learner autonomously obtains in the world. For considering new analytics for real-world learning, we confronted this difficulty by capturing and understanding human learning ex- periences in the world with ubiquitous computing technologies.  We discussed the distinctive characteristics of real-world learning and considered the requirements for assessing real-world learning situations. Our originality is based on the viewpoint that real-world learners use their bodies to interact with their surroundings and then to obtain knowledge about the world. We suggested obser- vation techniques of internal and external situations of a real-world learner and proposed a context estimation method for real-world learning by systematically integrating the heterogeneous elements of knowledge, behavior, and environment.  As a result of observing the internal situation (e.g., interest and knowledge) of a learner, we showed that each 3D region in an ecosystem promotes the acquisition of different knowledge. As a result of sensing the external situation of a learner, we showed that information access behavior and the 3D location of interest can be identified by sensing the learners body motion and pos- ture. As a result of integrating the internal and external situation of a learner, we showed that our technique can illustrate real-world spatial contexts of how each 3D region of the field encourages the learners knowledge acquisition (e.g., from the probability of knowledge acquisition and problematic situations). Our method enabled the estimation of 3D locations where discovery knowledge has not yet been achieved and the identification of potential infor- mation that should be examined. As another advantage, we showed a method to generate many indexes to systematically understand real-world learning situations, including, for example, the intensity of a learners interest in a certain target, the intensity of collabo- ration in his/her group, and the viewpoints from which the learner grasps and examines real-world problems.  The assessment method of high-level learners contexts in real- world learning is not proposed by conventional studies, but our sys- tematic integration method of the spatiotemporal occurrence infor- mation of real-world behavior is a foundation for learner-centered support adapted to the interest and viewpoint of each of the diverse learners in the world. Such support draws out new interests, view- points, and activities from each of the participants in group learning and promotes the emergence of new knowledge from real-world collaboration. Our new analytics with ubiquitous computing tech- niques is expected to be helpful in formatively designing a better learning environment for real-world learning.  7.

INTRODUCTION  Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics and  Knowledge (LAK) [10] study data and analytics in education,  teaching, and learning, suggesting educational priorities and  undertaking high-quality research into the models, methods,  technologies, and impact of analytics. One of the current  promising techniques in EDM and LAK is Educational Process  Mining (EPM). The basic idea of process mining is to extract  knowledge from event logs recorded by an information system.  EPM [12] aims to (i) construct complete and compact educational  process models that are able to reproduce all observed behaviour,  (ii) to check whether the modeled behaviour matches the observed  behaviour, and (iii) to project information extracted from the logs  onto the model, to make unexpressed knowledge explicit and to   facilitate better understanding of the process.    The results of EPM can be used to get a better understanding of  the underlying educational processes, to generate  recommendations and advice to students, to provide feedback to  either students, teachers or/and researchers, to detect learning  difficulties early, to help students with specific learning  disabilities, to improve management of learning objects, etc.; but  crucially, helping solve the difficulties that students of different  ages show when learn in highly cognitively and metacognitively  demanding learning environments like hypermedia or Computer  Based Learning Environments [3]. However, we have found two  problems when using EPM: 1) the model obtained cannot fit well  to the general students behaviour and 2) the model obtained can  be too large and complex for use or analysis by an instructor. In  order to resolve these problems, we propose to use clustering to  improve both the fitness and comprehensibility of the obtained  models by EPM.   This paper is organized as follow. Section 2 is a background  about related works. Section 3 describes the proposed approach.  Section 4 describes the datasets used. Section 5 describes the  experiments and finally, section 6 shows the conclusion and  future works.   2. BACKGROUND  Most of the traditional data mining techniques focus on data  dependencies or simple patterns and do not focus on the process  as a whole and do not provide visual representation of the  complete educational process ready to be analyzed [6]. However,  EPM techniques aim to extract process-related knowledge from  event logs recorded by an information system [13]. In fact,  nowadays there are an increasing number of examples about the  applicability of process mining in education.    Process mining has been used to extract knowledge from a  particular type of an educational information system, considering  (oversimplified) educational processes reflecting student  behaviour only in terms of their examination scores [13]. Several  process mining techniques such as Petri nets, Heuristic and Fuzzy  miner have been used to analyse assessment data from recently  organized online multiple choice tests [6]. Petri nets analysis has  been used to find learning paths or to optimise the path that a  student must follow in order to reach a degree or a qualification  [4]. Bottleneck mining and petri net simulation have been used to  detect discrepancies between the flows prescribed in a students  registration model and the actual process instances [2]. Heuristic  Mining has been used to analyze students writing activities to  improve not only the quality of the written document but more  importantly the writing skills of those involved [11]. Heuristic  Mining has been also used to investigate the processes in  students registration of Thailands universities for adaptive  process simplification in education [1].

Finally, we want to notice that we havent  found any work that uses clustering techniques together with  EPM.   3. PROPOSED APPROACH  In this paper, we proposed an approach that uses clustering for  improving educational process mining (see Figure 1).       Figure 1. Proposed approach versus the traditional approach.    The traditional approach uses all event log data to reveal a process  model of students behaviour.     On the other hand, this proposed approach firstly applies  clustering in order to group students with similar marks or  characteristics. It then applies process mining to discover more  specific models of student behaviour. We propose two different  clustering/grouping approaches:   Manual: To group students directly using only the students   marks obtained in the final exam of the course.   Automatic: To group students using a clustering algorithm   over the students interaction with the Moodles course.     4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA USED  The datasets used in this research were gathered from a Moodle  2.0 course used by 84 undergraduate university students taking  the Psychology degree in a university in the north of Spain. The  study was conducted during two different semesters in the years  2011-2012 and 2012-2013. The experiment took the form of an  assignment in the curriculum of a 3rd year compulsory subject.  Students were asked to participate in an eLearning/training  programme about learning to learn, related to the subjects  topic, completed entirely out of teaching hours. The programme  was made up of 11 different units that were sent to the students on  a weekly basis, but each of them was able to work on it during a  15 day period. Each unit was composed of three different types of  contents:    Declarative knowledge level: Theoretical contents,   description, information, and how-to put the learn to learn  strategy or strategies of the week into practice.     Procedural knowledge level: Practical tasks where the  students had to put their declarative knowledge into practice.    Conditional knowledge level: Discussion forums where the  students had to discuss about how they had or would use the  strategy or strategies of the week in different contexts.   Students get an extra point in their final subject grade if they  complete at least 80% of the assignments. Compulsory  assignments for each unit were to solve the practical task and to  post at least one comment on each unit forum. Suggested  assignments for each unit were to understand the theoretical  contents, put them in practice in the task, and share their  experience about the weeks topic in the forum. Based on the data  obtained after students worked on the entire programme, we used  three different sources of information.     On the one hand, we used a summary about the interaction of  each student in Moodle calculated from Moodles log and  different tables of the database (Table 1).     Table 1. Variables of a student in our Moodle summary file.   Name Description Extraction Method  under Moodle  nomenclature   Time  Theory   Total time spent on  theoretical contents   Time between  viewing resource and  next different action   Time Tasks Total time spent on  practical tasks   Time between  viewing quiz/   attempting quiz/  continuing quiz   attempt/ closing quiz  attempt and next  different action   Time  Forums   Total time spent  reviewing forums    Time between  viewing forum and  the next different   action   Days  Theory   How long students  wait to check the   content    Date resource was  viewed since content  became available on   Moodle (in days)   Days Tasks How long students  wait to check the   task    Date task was viewed  since task became   available on Moodle  (in days)   Days hand  in   Taking time in hand  in the task    Date quiz attempt  closed since task   became available on  Moodle (in days)   Number of  Words in  forums   Number of words in  forum posts   Extracting number of  words added to forum  discussion OR forum  replay words added    Number of  sentences in   forums   Number of  sentences in forum   posts   Extracting number of  sentences added to   forum discussion OR  forum replay   12    sentences added   We saved/converted all this information into an .ARFF (Attribute- Relation File Format) file to be able to apply clustering  algorithms provided by Weka [16].    On the other hand, we also used the log file provided by Moodle  directly (see Table 2).     Table 2. Variables of a Modle log files.   Attribute Description  Course The name of the course   IP Address The IP of the device used to access   Time The date they accessed it   Full Name The name of the student   Action The action that student has done   Information More information about the action     We preprocessed this log file (see Table 2) thus: we only used the  last four variables, that is, we did not use the name of the course  (it is the same for all records) or the IP address (it is irrelevant for  our purposes). We turned the students names into IDs  (Identifiers) to maintain their privacy. We filtered the possible  actions in our log file. So, from 39 actions that Moodle stored in  our log file, we only used the next 20 actions that are related to  the students activities in the course: upload assignment, view  assignment, view course, view folder, add forum discussion, add  forum post, update forum post, view forum discussion, view  forum, view page, submit questionnaire, view questionnaire,  attempt quiz, close quiz attempt, continue quiz attempt, review  quiz, view quiz, view quiz summary, view resource, and view url.  We then transformed this log file into a MXML (Minimal XML)  file using the proMimport framework in order to can use ProM  [14] for later process mining.    Finally, we used the students final marks, or the scores they  obtained in the final exam at the end of the course. This is a file  provided by the instructor that contains both each students ID  and his or her final mark (a numeric value on a 10-point scale).  We turned this continuous value into a categorical value using the  traditional academic grading in Spain: 0-4.9: fail and 5-10: pass.     5. EXPERIMENTS  We carried out several experiments to test our proposal. In the  first, we used all the log data about the 84 students. In the second,  we divided firstly the original log file into two datasets: one that  contains the 68 students who passed and other with the 16  students who failed. And in the last experiment, we have used the  Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm provided by  Weka [16] to group together students of similar characteristics  when using Moodle (see Table 1). We used this algorithm  because it is a well-known clustering algorithm that does not  require the user to specify the number of clusters to find. In our  case, we obtained three clusters with the following distribution of  students:     Cluster 0: 23 students (22 pass and 1 fail).    Cluster 1: 41 students (39 pass and 2 fail).    Cluster 2: 20 students (13 fail and 7 pass).   Clustering algorithms provide a high interpretable result model by  means of the values of each cluster centroid (Table 3). The  centroid represents the most typical case/student or prototype in a  cluster, which does not necessarily describe any given case in that  cluster.   Table 3. Values (meanstd.dev.) of centroids of each cluster.   Attribute Cluster  0 Cluster 1 Cluster 2  Time Theory 5.93.2 7.12.6 3.91.5   Time Tasks 14.12.7 11.36.2 5.31.9   Time Forums 8.77.0 12.45.4 7.64.5   Days Theory 6.02.4 1.66.9 8.42.6   Days Tasks 3.51.0 1.80.8 6.82.3   Days hand in 4.80.9 3.01.2 9.32.2   Number of words  in forums   7.56.5 9.23.5 5.33.4   Number of  sentences in  forums   92.923.1 107.840.6 78.139.4     As shown by the mean values in the different variables, students  in clusters 0 and 1 (in which most students pass) obtain higher  values than cluster 2 (in which most students fail) in times  (theory, task and forums) and numbers (of words and sentences in  forums), but lower values in days (theory, tasks and hand in).  Cluster 0 gives priority to the procedural level of knowledge,  corresponding to the scores at the Time tasks and Days Tasks. The  students comprising that cluster also seem to show an  achievement or strategic approach based on the prioritisation of  the actions related to the compulsory assignments. In contrast,  students belonging to Cluster 1 are presumably adopting a more  dedicated approach to learning: note that the scores are good  whether or not the variables are related with compulsory or  suggested assignments. Finally, Cluster 2, comprised of students  who normally fail, shows maladaptive profiles and a more  infrequent use of Moodle.     We then applied process mining over the different datasets (all,  pass/mark and clusters) in order to discover students process  models and workflows in each one of these logs. We used ProM,  [14] a generic tool for implementing process mining tools in a  standard environment. In fact, we applied Heuristic Miner, [1] one  of the robust algorithms to investigate the processes in users  behaviour. Heuristic Miner can be used to express the main  behaviour registered in an event log. It focuses on the control  flow perspective and generates a process model in the form of a  Heuristics Net for the given event log. Therefore, the Heuristic  Miner algorithm was designed to make use of a frequency based  metric and so it is less sensitive to noise and the incompleteness  of logs. We used the default threshold parameters of Heuristic  Miner algorithm provided by ProM and the fitness as a quality  measure (see Table 4). Fitness is a quality measure indicating the  gap between the behaviour actually observed in the log and the   13    behaviour described by the process model. It gives the extent to  which the log traces can be associated with execution paths  specified by the process model. If model has a poor fitness value,  this indicates that the mined process model does not successfully  parse most of the log traces. This may be due to the presence of  noise, resulting in dangling activities and missing connections. It  is also possible that the parameter settings do not notice all  connections.   Table 4. Fitness of the obtained models   Dataset Fitness   All students 0.8333   Pass students 0.9117   Fail students 0.9375   Cluster 0 students 0.9130   Cluster 1 students 0.9024   Cluster 2 students 0.9000  As we can see in Table 4, the lowest fitness was obtained when  using all data in which 70 of 84 students fit to the obtained model,  that is, 83.33% of all students. On the other hand, all the other  models (obtained using both manual and automatic clustering)  obtained a fitness value greater than 90% in all the cases. And the  highest fitness value was obtained when using data from students  who failed, where 15 of 16 students fit to the obtained model, that  is, 93.75% of students who failed. So, in this case/experiment we  can see that these specific models obtained using manual and  automatic grouping/clustering performed/fitted better than the  general model obtained from all students.    Next, some information about the level of complexity or size of  each one of the obtained models (Table 5) and two examples of  obtained models (Figure 2 and 3) are described. The model  discovered by Heuristic Miner algorithm is a heuristic net, drawn  as a directed cycle graph, which represents the most frequent  behaviours of the students of the dataset used.    We have used two typical measures from graph theory (the total  number of nodes and the total number of links) in order to see the  level of complexity of the models.   Table 5. Complexity/Size of the obtained models   Dataset N.Nodes N.Links   All students 32 70   Pass students 113 244   Fail students 12 24   Cluster 0 students 61 121   Cluster 1 students 59 110   Cluster 2 students 38 84     As we can see in Table 5, the smaller or more comprehensible  model was obtained with students who failed followed by all  students and cluster 2 students. On the other hand, the other three  models are much bigger and complex. We think that the reasons  for this may be that:    In the dataset all students, the students show different  behaviour and only have some common actions because  there are mixed different type of students (pass and fail  students).    In the datasets students who failed and cluster 2 students,  the students show only some common behavioural patterns  because this type of student participates/interacts little with  Moodle.    In the datasets students who pass, cluster 0 and cluster 1,  students show much more common behavioural patterns  because these types of students are more active users of  Moodle   Finally, two examples of obtained models (heuristic nets) are  described. The first example shows the heuristic net obtained  when using all students (Figure 2) and the second when using fail  students (Figure 3). In our heuristic nets the square boxes  represent the actions of the students when interacting with  Moodles interface, and the arcs/links represent  dependences/relations between actions     Figure 2. Heuristic net of all students.     Figure 3. Heuristic net of fail students.   On the one hand, Figure 2 shows two subnets that follow most of  the student of the course. The upper subnet consists of some view  forum actions about the most viewed forums in the course. And  the lower subnet consists of some view quiz actions about the  most viewed quizzed in the course.    On the other hand, Figure 3 shows two subnets that follow most  of the students who fail the course. The upper subnet consists of  some page view actions about the most viewed pages. These  pages are about general information on the course. The lower  subnet consists of some view quiz actions about the most viewed   14    quizzed. In this case/dataset, the number of quizzes is much lower  than in the previous case (see lower part of Figure 2) and not in  the same exact order of visiting.   In summary, both Figures 2 and 3, show the most typical  behaviour of the students in each case/dataset. But, it is  interesting to see that the heuristic net of students who failed is  smaller than the heuristic net of all students. From an educational  and practical point of view (to be able to use this information for  providing feedback to instructors about student learning), it could  easily be used to point out new students at risk of failing the  course. For example, instructors only have to check if new  students follow the same specific routes/behavioural patterns that  shown by the heuristic net of students who failed. That is, if they  visit the same pages, view the same quizzes, and in the same  order as previous students who failed.   6. CONCLUSIONS  In the present work, we propose to use clustering to improve  educational process mining and, at the same time, optimise both  the performance/fitness and comprehensibility/size of the model  obtained. In particular, the comprehensibility of the model is a  core goal in education due to the transferral of basic knowledge  that it entails. Making graphs, models or visual representation  more accessible or at least, accessible, to teachers and students,  makes these results very useful for monitoring the learning  process and providing feedback, one of our future goals being to  do it in real time. Furthermore, Moodle does not provide specific  visualization tools of students usage data that let the different  agents of the learning process understand these large amounts of  raw data and become aware of what is happening in distance  learning, apart from extending the use of the results to Adaptive  Hypermedia Learning Environments in which it is very useful to  prompt students or recommend learning paths, shortenings, etc.,  in order to enhance the learning experience in a more strategic  way.   In the future, we want to do more experiments in order to test our  proposed approach with other types of courses from different  fields. We also want to explore other ways to group students  before process mining. For example, grouping students based on  the triangulation of the different sources of information used at  this work and adding, if possible, self-report data from students  metacognitive behaviour.   7.

INTRODUCTION  Every college student registers for courses from a catalog of  hundreds or even thousands of offerings each term. Selecting the  courses in which to enroll, and in what combinations, can  dramatically impact each students chances for academic  success, progression towards degree, and retention within the  field and the institution. Learning analytics has the potential to  leverage historical student data to better inform students  decisions and ultimately improve their understanding of how  course content and learning outcomes might better serve their  ultimate institutional and long-term career objectives.   First implemented in 2008, the Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Academy identifies  talented diverse incoming students with interest in STEM fields  who, for reasons of socioeconomic class, first generation college  student status, lack of high school rigor, race, or gender, might  not be successful in pursuing a STEM degree [1]. The STEM  Academy provides students with a highly coordinated and  holistic support system during the critical transition years  between high school graduation and the declaration of a STEM  concentration by the third undergraduate year. Components of  the program include an intensive pre-first year summer program,  academic coaching, limited financial support, mentoring, study  groups, and community building.   One of the primary objectives of the STEM Academy is to  graduate students with an overall grade point average (GPA) of  3.0 or above. There are a number of predictors of overall GPA at  completion of the baccalaureate degree [2, 3].  These may  include, but are not limited to, standardized test scores, first and  second year college GPA, first-generation college status, and  family income.

Nor has the impact on cumulative GPA of  enrolled students taking some courses at community colleges or  online and then transferring the credit been studied.   The STEM Academys academic advisers, as well as general  engineering academic advisers, help students select courses that  will hopefully lead them on the pathway towards success in their  chosen academic career. Until recently, academic advising has  been largely based on advisors intuition, prior experience, and  institutional knowledge. With newly created analytic tools and  reports, advisors can begin to infer how a particular student may  perform in following semester, by comparing the data from  previous students who were in similar condition, such as  Advanced Placement (AP) credits, previous performance in core  courses, or demographic data. However, a coherent system is  needed to bring these disparate data sources together in order to  better inform the course-selection process for students and their  advisors alike.    A course recommendation system can allow advisors and  students to make plans for future semesters, equipped with data  on courses or even majors in which past students with similar  programs, grades, and course histories had found success [4].  Degree Compass was one of the first such systems to use  predictive analytics techniques to rank courses using grade and  enrollment data, delivering information that could potentially  help a student progress more readily through a chosen program.  While Degree Compass had initial overall success, the  predictive model of a C grade (2.0 GPA) or better lacks the  specificity needed for the highly competitive undergraduate  environment in which the STEM Academy is situated.  Furthermore, examining course prediction in isolation obscures  the variety of course combinations students register for in a  given academic term; particular combinations can be  academically hazardous to individual students, depending on  their academic background. It is therefore necessary to examine  course-taking behavior in concurrent patterns as well. For both  academic advisors and students, predictive models utilizing rich  and meaningful information, can greatly inform students  course-planning decisions, particularly in the critical transition  years from secondary to higher education. Understanding these  patterns and student characteristics that can accurately predict  academic success is a first step before construction of a  concurrent course recommendation system can begin. This paper  describes our investigation in service of this goal.   2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS  The overall goal of the Customized Course Advising (CCA)  project is to determine the optimal term-by-term course  selections for all engineering students based on their incoming  characteristics and previous course history and performance,  paying particular attention to concurrent enrollment. This paper  describes the preliminary data mining investigation that must  precede any implementation of a course recommendation system  in order to identify the key metrics and refine the predictive  models. The overarching research questions guiding this  investigation are:    What scholastic characteristics of first-year engineering  students are most predictive of future academic success    What concurrent course-enrollment patterns are most  predictive of future academic success   Uncovering the relationship between first-year engineering  students academic background and their concurrent course  enrollment is an important and critical component of the  development of a robust and dynamic course recommendation  system that is able to consider the totality of a students course  load, academic trajectory, and ultimate goals within the  institution.   3. BACKGROUND  Many students plunge into college level work with no difficulty.  Other students can struggle and seem to need carefully adjusted  course loads and sequences that will maximize academic success  as indicated by course grades and overall GPA while still  maintaining a reasonable time to degree (and may have positive  effects on students self-efficacy and self-regulation as well).  This transitional phase for any given student, if needed at all,  can range from the first semester freshman year up to and  including the first semester sophomore year.  The challenge lies  in (1) identifying the student who needs this transitional period  and (2) determining the combination of courses (A) within a  given semester, (B) from semester to semester, and (C) transfer  credit from other academic institutions that will optimize student  success while still remaining on track to graduation.   In prior work, members of our research team have worked with  the STEM Academy to develop Student Explorer, an early  warning system (see [5], [6]). While early warning systems  leverage learning analytics techniques to identify students in  need of additional academic support (e.g., [7]), course  recommendation systems are designed to be useful for all  students regardless of perceived need. Both types of systems  share the goal to ultimately reduce the time and effort involved  in the feedback loops between students, instructors, and  academic advisors [8]. Early attempts at course recommendation  systems relied on social input (e.g., [9]), predating automated  input from student academic history data which utilizes learning  analytics to identify actionable points of decision-making, in this  case, which courses, and in what combination, to enroll in a  given term. Ultimately, the goal of a well-designed course  recommendation system should be to provide useful data that  allows the student (and their advisor, if applicable) to make  intelligent decisions for their own course of study, supporting  notions of self-advocacy and self-regulated decisions.  4. METHODOLOGY  The sample for the analyses was drawn from the data warehouse  of a large American Midwestern university. According to the  Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education  (http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org), this institution is  a large, public, primarily residential four-year research  university with very high research activity and a majority  undergraduate enrollment. The university enrolls approximately  28,000 undergraduate students, more than 80% of whom are  enrolled full-time, have entering test scores in the top fifth of all  American baccalaureate institutions, and fewer than 20% of  whom transfer in from other institutions. The engineering  college enrolls approximately 5,800 undergraduate students,  21% of the total undergraduate population.    4.1 Data Sources  Academic history and demographic data from the institutional  data warehouse was drawn from undergraduate students who   17    matriculated into the engineering college between the fall 2001  and fall 2012 semesters (N=12,836). Nearly three-quarters  (75%) of the students were male and 11.5% were international  (non-US) students. The average incoming Math ACT score was  31 (out of 36) and the average incoming Math SAT score was  709 (out of 800) (ACT and SAT are college readiness  assessments taken in high school as part of the college  application process). These students enrolled in 6,877 unique  courses throughout their undergraduate tenure (some students  have not yet graduated).   The warehouse data included records such as students course  enrollment information, credit for courses taken at other  institutions (transfer credit), achievement and placement test  scores, and final degree information. In this paper, the analyses  primarily focused on analyzing enrollment information, which  included course name, course section, course grade, semester  GPA, and enrolled term. Students preparation level when  entering university, such as ACT and SAT scores, Advanced  Placement (AP) credits, and placement tests as well as final  degree status, such as number of years took to graduate, kind of  achieved degree, and final GPA, were also included in the  analyses. The scope of the analysis was limited to enrollment  data and incoming academic measures, while setting aside  demographic information. Demographic information was  excluded to limit the complexity for this preliminary study.   4.2 Procedure  The analysis started by identifying the first semester math  course students selected. Often times, proficiency in math  readiness assessments is considered as an indicator of success in  university engineering courses [10]. In this context, the first  semester math course can be considered as an indicator of  undergraduate engineering students academic preparation level,  in terms of equivalent credit and subjective confidence in math.  For example, incoming students can satisfy course requirements  with AP, IB, or other A-Level Credit exams, and take higher- level courses in the first semester. This leads to a wide variety of  first semester course combinations.    The grade of 3.0 was set as a standard of academic success. This  standard, a grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, was set  because it is (1) the minimum GPA required by most  engineering employers for internships and permanent positions,  and (2) it is a goal of the STEM Academy. Whether students  finish their degree as originally entered was also considered as  an indicator of success. Although students entered the university  as a part of the engineering program, not all of them graduate  with an engineering degree.  So if a student graduated from the  College of Engineering with a final GPA of 3.0 or better, we  considered this student as successfully graduated as an  engineer.    There are six math courses that engineering students can select  in their first semester. This variety is the widest among all  subjects in core-required courses that freshmen engineering  students take, such as engineering, chemistry, and physics.  Grouping students by their first term math courses was a simple  and easy way to group students and achieve various profiles  from many students.   5. RESULTS  5.1 Scholastic Characteristics of Engineering  Students  In order to predict which students are likely to be successful in  college, the analysis started from profiling the incoming  characteristics of students, which include high school GPA, high  school GPA percentile, ACT math score, and SAT math score.  Groups were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA)  and post-hoc Tukey.    High correlation between first semester GPA and graduation  GPA (r = 0.763, p < 0.001) showed that first semester  performance is very important for engineering students.  Choosing which courses to take in the first semester may  become a critical decision with students academic performance  throughout the graduation, and selecting the first semester math  course can be a major determinant of the overall first semester  performance.    5.1.1 High School Records, ACT Math Score, and  SAT Math Score  Of the six math courses offered in the fall semester that  freshmen engineering students typically select, four of them,  Calculus I, Calculus II, Multivariable Calculus, and Differential  Equations, belong to the engineering core required courses. Two  other math courses, Pre-Calculus and Applied Honors Calculus  II are not included in the core courses but are popular choices.  Pre-Calculus is recommended for students who do not have AP  credit and the result of math placement test advised them as  need to take additional preparing course for the later calculus  sequences. Applied Honors Calculus II is an alternative to  Calculus II, designed for students who scored a 4 or 5 (out of 5)  on the Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus exam.    Records of high school performance were not meaningful for  predicting the academic performance of students. The  correlations between students' high school records and first  semester performance or graduation GPA were significant, but  the absolute values for coefficients were below 0.1 (Table 1).  There were significant differences between students' high school  GPA between starting math courses [F(5, 5779) = 64.66, p <  0.001]. A post hoc Tukey test showed that the high school GPAs  of Pre-Calculus students were significantly higher than those of  students starting with Multivariate Calculus (p < 0.01) and  Differential Equations (p < 0.001). Students' high school GPA  percentile had a similar pattern [F(5, 5779) = 67.89, p < 0.001].  Engineering students' ACT and SAT math scores, however,  were positively correlated with first semester GPA and  graduation GPA, ranging from 0.364 to 0.412 (Table 1). Also,  students' ACT and SAT math scores, on average, increased by  the difficulty of starting math courses (Table 2). ACT Math  scores of each starting math courses were significantly different  [F(5, 4841) = 342.4, p < 0.001]. A post-hoc test showed that  scores are significantly different except between Applied  Honors Calculus II and Multivariate Calculus, and Differential  Equations (p < 0.001). Students' SAT math scores were all  significantly different [F(5, 4286) = 225, p < 0.001]. SAT Math  scores were significantly different except between Multivariate  calculus and Differential Equations (p < 0.001), meaning that  ACT or SAT math subject scores are more meaningful  predictors than high school records for assuming students  academic preparation level for engineering.   18    5.1.2 AP Calculus Exam Scores  The AP Calculus exam is one way that students can show their  proficiency in math. Depending on what kind of AP Calculus  exam the student passes, they can waive corresponding courses  and proceed to more advanced math course. AP Calculus AB  (AB) is a calculus course taken after the Pre-Calculus course in  high school. AP Calculus BC (BC) is also a calculus course, but  covers additional topics from AB. If students have scores of AB  (4 or 5), or 4 of BC exam, it is equivalent of Calculus I. If  students have score of 5 from BC exam, it is equivalent of  Calculus II. Most students who have credit from AP Calculus  exam take Calculus II or higher courses as their first semester  math course. Table 3 shows the success rate (percentage of  students who received a 3.0 or better) on first semester GPA,  graduation GPA, and starting math courses by AP Calculus  exam scores.  The AP scores largely determine enrollment numbers. For  example, students with Calculus AB typically enroll in Calculus  II and Applied Honors Calculus II, while Calculus BC students  typically enroll in Multivariate Calculus and Differential  Equations courses.    Students' first semester GPA and final graduation GPA was  significantly different by AP Calculus exam scores [F(3, 3202)  = 124.8, p < 0.001]. A post-hoc Tukey revealed that the  differences for semester GPA between AB and BC tests were  significant (p < 0.01). The semester GPAs of BC 5 students  were significantly higher than students with other AP Calculus  scores (p < 0.01), while AB 5 and BC 4 students were not  significantly different. A similar pattern was observed with final  graduation GPA [F(3, 3202) = 107.6, p < 0.001], such that   students with BC 5 scores were significantly higher than AB 4  and BC 4 students (p < 0.01). Students scoring an AB 5 were  not significantly different with students with a 4 or 5 on the AP  BC exam.    In Calculus II, the higher students scored in the AP test, the  higher the success rates were. Students' course performance was  significantly different by AP exam scores [F(3, 1620)=62.27, p  < 0.001]. A post-hoc test revealed that the performance of  students with a BC 5 score was significantly higher than other  AP scores (p < 0.05). While the average grade of AB 5 and BC  4 students were not significantly different, both were  significantly different from students who scored an AB 4 (p <  0.001). The average grades of Applied Honors Calculus II  students were significantly different by AP exam scores [F(3,  401) = 16.19, p < 0.001], while the over 90% of students with  AB 5, BC 4, and BC 5 earned 3.0 or better grade. A post-hoc  test showed that the performance of students with AB 4 was  significantly lower than students with other AP Calculus scores  (p < 0.001). Students in Multivariate Calculus showed  significant difference of average grade by AP exam score [F(3,  987) = 3.617, p < 0.05]. However, no pairs of AP exam scores  showed significantly different results. Lastly, students in  Differential Equations had the similar pattern as students in  Applied Honors Calculus II. Average course grades were  significantly different by AP exam scores [F(3, 182) = 3.855, p  < 0.05]. Performance of students in this course with AB 4 was  significantly lower than students with BC scores of 4 or 5.   Table 1.

Although  this number is quite large, the variability of course combination  can be abstracted based on the required courses.    In order to declare an engineering major, every engineering  undergraduate student needs to finish their 55 credit hours of  core requirement courses, including chemistry, engineering,  physics, math, and courses for intellectual breadth (courses from  outside of the engineering college) with a minimum GPA of 2.0.    Engineering core courses consist of Introduction to Engineering  and Introduction to Computers and Programming. For  chemistry, there is General Chemistry lecture, two general  chemistry labs, and a Structure and Reactivity lecture and lab.  Physics core courses are General Physics I lecture and lab, and  General Physics 2 lecture and lab. Core math courses are four  math courses: Calculus I and II, Multivariate Calculus, and  Differential Equations. Pre-Calculus is a requirement for  Calculus I, but it does not count as a core course. Applied  Honors Calculus is an equivalent of Calculus II. For intellectual  breadth, students are required to take 16 credit hours from  outside of the engineering college. This wide range of courses   generates copious unique combinations in concurrent course  enrollment.    5.2.1 Course Combination Selection Pattern  Table 4 shows the top 5 popular course combinations for each  first-term math course. This table explains 24.35% of total  course combinations. Although most of engineering students  course selections, especially for the first semester, are limited  within a certain range, courses that count as intellectual breadth,  such as Introduction to Psychology or Introduction to Sociology,  add to the wide variety of small-percentage combinations.   By comparing the subtotal frequencies of combinations by first- term math courses, it can be observed that the concurrent course  enrollment patterns are more fixed, as the level of math courses  gets lower. Students who start with higher-level math courses  select a wider variety of courses from core-required courses or  others. Statistically, when comparing each pair of math courses,  the proportion of students who take one of the top five most  popular course combinations is significantly higher for the lower  level math course (z > 3, p < 0.01), with the exception of the  pairs of Calculus II-Applied Honors Calculus II and Multivariate  Calculus and Differential Equations which are not significantly  different.

Success  rates for each course are the percentage of the course N.         20    Some courses were limited with certain groups of math courses.  For example, popular courses for Pre-Calculus starters were  limited to General Chemistry and Introduction to Engineering.  Variations were made with whether taking lab courses of  General Chemistry, and extra courses from outside of core  requirements. For students enrolled in Calculus I, Structure and  Reactivity, an advanced chemistry course set, and Introduction  to Computing and Programming, which requires prior or  concurrent enrollment in Calculus I or equivalent, were a  popular combination. Patterns for students enrolled in Calculus  II or higher starter groups were similar. Physics courses were   also a popular course combination. Students in Calculus II or  higher choose the General Chemistry set, the Structure and  Reactivity set, or the General Physics I set. And a selection of  Introduction to Computers and Programming is added.     5.2.2 Performance Characteristics of Patterns  In Table 4, the most popular course that students selected from  outside of the core engineering courses was The Engineering  Profession (TEP). This course is 2 credit hour seminar course  learning about career paths as an engineer. Since the grade curve  of this course is set high (an average grade of 3.82 (SD = 0.49)),   Table 4.

For students enrolled in Pre-Calculus, first semester GPA  between course combinations were significantly different [F(4,  206) = 2.968, p < 0.05]. However, taking TEP with the General  Chemistry lecture and Introduction to Engineering did not result  in a boost for students' semester GPA. Introduction to Sociology  and Introduction to Psychology did not make significant  differences either.    The performances of Calculus I combinations were significantly  different [F(4, 1255) = 11.5, p < 0.001]. Taking TEP course  with Calculus I significantly increased students' semester GPA.  Students' semester performance was significantly higher when  taking TEP with General Chemistry lecture and lab courses and  either one of the engineering core courses (p < 0.01).   Calculus II combinations semester GPA were also significantly  different [F(4, 759) = 2.752, p < 0.05]. However, the semester  GPA for students enrolled in a combination of TEP, General  Chemistry lecture and lab, and Introduction to Computers and  Programming was not significantly higher than a combination  without TEP.   For Applied Honors Calculus II, combinations were not  significantly different (F(4, 182) = 1.339, p = 0.257]. Although  the semester GPA was significantly different for students  enrolled in Multivariate Calculus combinations [F(4, 402) =  3.706, p < 0.01] and Differential Equations [F(4, 90) =4.092, p  = 0.01], no meaningful comparison of TEP between  combination was found.   Combinations between General Chemistry and General Physics  I, with Introduction to Computers and Programming were not  significantly different. Among popular combinations of Calculus   II and Differential Equations courses, Introduction to Computers  and Programming was concurrently taken with General  Chemistry or General Physics I. Semester GPAs were not  significantly different in both starting math course groups. A  similar pattern was observed between students enrolled in  General Chemistry and Structure and Reactivity. In Calculus I,  Applied Honors Calculus II, and Multivariate Calculus, the most  popular combinations included pairing the math course with  either Introduction to Engineering or Introduction to Computers  and Programming. Average semester GPAs were not  significantly different for students enrolled in these three first- term math course groups.   5.2.3 Number of Credit and Semester Performance  by Starting Math Courses  Students most often take either 13 credits or 15 credits in the  first semester. The institution considers 13-18 credits as full time  enrollment, equating to 3-4 core courses and one non-core  course.. Since engineering students need to complete their  intellectual breadth requirements, many students who take more  than 13 credits enroll in courses outside of the engineering  college. Students who took more than 13 credit hours had  significantly higher semester GPAs (M=3.06 vs. 2.94, SD=0.85  vs. 0.86, t(7395.508) = 7.5383, p < 0.001). Between the math  courses, semester GPA was significantly different [F(11, 12033)  = 164.3, p < 0.001], except for students who took Pre-Calculus  and Applied Honors Calculus II in their first semester (p <  0.001) (Table 5). This finding is partially complicated. Pre- Calculus is a required course, for students who test low on the  mathematics placement exam, to enroll in Calculus I. However,  Pre-Calculus enrollment does not count for financial aid  enrollment since it does not count toward the engineering degree   Table 5. Semester Performance by Starting Math Courses and Credit Hour   First Semester Math  Course   More Than 13  Credit Hour   N % First Semester  GPA Success Average Semester GPA   Pre-Calculus       Yes 339 38.94% 2.80 (SD=0.61)   No 239 31.8% 2.65 (SD=0.64)   Calculus I       Yes 2963 56.63% 3.04 (SD=0.56)   No 1455 45.29% 2.85 (SD=0.64)   Calculus II       Yes 2147 69.63% 3.05 (SD=0.55)   No 1057 60.17% 3.20 (SD=0.62)   Applied Honors Calculus II       Yes 601 82.86% 3.41 (SD=0.47)   No 246 79.67% 3.32 (SD=0.54)   Multivariate Calculus       Yes 1629 83.79% 3.45 (SD=0.52)   No 669 75.93% 3.30 (SD=0.58)   Differential Equations       Yes 532 87.47% 3.53 (SD=0.49)   No 168 75.00% 3.26 (SD=0.68)      22    completion. Thus, students with financial aid packages enrolled  in Pre-Calculus must take at least 15 credit hours.   5.2.4 Comparison among Core Requirement  Courses  As presented in section 5.2.1, concurrent course enrollment  patterns were very complex. For example, some students did not  take the lab courses with related lecture class in the same  semester. Some students enrolled in more than 13 credit hours,  and some took a variety of courses not included in the core  engineering required courses. This complexity made it difficult  to recognize the impact of certain courses on the first semester  performance. However, we observed that some courses or  course sets are rarely enrolled together in a single semester.   Regardless of the course levels, the popular course combination  for the first semester student was taking one course from math  subject (12,071 out of 12,836 students enrolled in one of the  math courses in the first semester), one from engineering  subject, and a course set (lab and lecture courses) of either  chemistry or physics (Table 4). Generally, this combination fills  the minimum 13 credit hours. This analysis was conducted to  determine which course selection gave students more benefit  among these courses or disciplinary course set.   A logistic regression model was built to see how the particular  choice of core course or course set within the same subject  category effects on students first semester success (whether  they earn 3.0 or better GPA) (Table 6). Students were  categorized by their starting math courses. In terms of chemistry  and physics course sets, it was counted only if a student took  both lab and lecture courses in the first semester. With this   model, we could investigate which course or course set can be  more beneficial to the students by their starting math courses.  The exponential of the log odds in Table 6 represent the ratio of  students proportion on being successful in comparing course  over base course.    Regardless of starting math course group, every course or course  set selection had a significant impact on the first semester  performance except one course set pair. Taking an advanced  level course or course set within the same subject or taking a  physics course set instead of chemistry course set gave students  a better chance of success in their first semester (from 1.152 to  2.465 times, p < 0.05). Taking more than 13 credit hours also  increased the chance of success by 1.744 (p < 0.001).   However, when the model was adapted separately by starting  math course, only few courses or course sets showed a  significant increase in the odd ratios. For Pre-Calculus starters,  taking the Structure and Reactivity course set rather than the  General Chemistry course set increased the likelihood of getting  a semester GPA of 3.0 or better by 5.442 times (p < 0.01). For  students who are starting with Differential Equations, taking  Introduction to Computers and Programming, instead of  Introduction to Engineering, increased the odds of success in the  first semester by 2.348 times (p < 0.001). Also, students who  took the Structure and Reactivity course set showed more  likelihood of successful semester GPA than those who took  General Physics I course set. Lastly, in terms of whether  students take more than 13 credit hours in the semester, every  starting math group showed the significant improvements if they  took more credits, except for Pre-Calculus and Applied Honor  Calculus II groups.

DISCUSSION  6.1 Summary of Our Findings  Our investigation described in this paper was guided by two  overarching research questions: (1) what scholastic  characteristics of first-year engineering students are most  predictive of future academic success And (2) what concurrent  course-enrollment patterns are most predictive of academic  success The high correlation coefficient between first semester  GPA and final graduation GPA indicated that first semester  performance is very important to engineering students  academic success. Thus, analyzing students first semester  enrollment and success patterns is critical for developing a  course recommendation system.    To answer the first question, we compared high school records,  ACT Math scores, SAT Math scores, and AP Calculus exam  scores with students academic performance. We found that  ACT Math and SAT Math scores were significantly correlated  with first semester GPA and graduation GPA, while high school  records only showed small correlation coefficients. Also, ACT  Math and SAT Math scores were significantly different by  students' starting math courses. Semester GPA and graduation  GPA were also significantly different by AP Calculus Exam  scores. The performance of students with AB 4, the lowest score  to earn credit for Calculus I, in math courses were significantly  lower than other AP scores across math courses. These results  indicate that ACT Math, SAT Math, and AP Calculus scores  effectively indicate the academic preparation level of freshmen  engineering students, and can be used for predicting student  success.    For the second guiding research question, we observed that there  is a greater variety of unique course combinations starting math  course increases in difficulty level. Also, The Engineering  Profession (TEP) survey course has relatively high average  grade. Taking the TEP course with other core requirement  courses were expected to boost students semester performance.  However, only students who started with the Calculus I course  benefited from TEP enrollment.    Students who took more than the minimum 13 required credit  hours per semester performed significantly better, except those  who started with Pre-Calculus and Applied Honors Calculus II.  Students with financial aid packages enrolled in Pre-Calculus  must take at least 15 credit hours. This means that the non- engineering requirement courses, which other students success  rates benefit from, may not helping students who begin in low  level math courses like Pre-Calculus.    Lastly, we found that some courses or course sets affects  students semester performance significantly. Among students  who started with Pre-Calculus math course, those who took  Structure and Reactivity course set showed higher likelihood of  earning a 3.0 or better GPA in the first semester than students  who started with the General Chemistry I course set. Students  who started with Differential Equations had a higher chance of  success when they took Introduction to Computers and  Programming instead of Introduction to Engineering. The  Structure and Reactivity course set also helped when compared  to the General Physics II.    6.2 Contribution of This Study  This study sheds light on the importance of identifying the  scholastic characteristics and concurrent course enrollment of  freshmen engineering students. Both are important to help   students achieve success in their first semester, which is very  highly correlated with the final performance. Suggesting the  right courses for students based on the incoming  characteristics may help them achieve the academic success  necessary for pursuing successful STEM careers and graduate  STEM degrees.  The findings in this paper help identify the requirements for a  predictive model that can give insight for students and advisors  during course registration to raise the probability of earning a  GPA of 3.0 or better in first semester, and ultimately the  foundation of a concurrent course recommendation system.    For example, AP Calculus scores are better predictors of success  in the core math courses than GPA or ACT score. So AP  Calculus scores, when available, should be treated as the main  factor in selecting the appropriate math course for an incoming  freshman.   If a student from the engineering college starts with a low-level  math course, such as Pre-Calculus or Calculus I, the selection of  other courses is limited since they do not meet the pre- requirements of other courses, such as physics course sets. Also,  students who started with Pre-Calculus showed that they do not  benefit from taking non-required courses.    On the other hand, students who can start in higher-level math  courses may widen their range for course consideration.  Students with higher AP Calculus score earned higher semester  GPA, final graduation GPA, and starting math course  performance. While starting in higher-level course may fulfill  their academic curiosity and accelerate their time to degree,  starting in relatively lower-level class can lead to solidifying the  students preparation for further engineering major courses.   6.3 Limitations  There were some limitations of the study. First, in this initial  investigation, there were too many variables to consider with  limited time and resources. With more than 3,000 unique course  combinations among first-year engineering students, analyzing  only the most popular combinations is not enough to reveal  every detail of concurrent course enrollment patterns. Second,  the scope of the analysis was limited. Even though the results  from first semester are important, it does not fully explain  students future academic success or course enrollment.  Analyses such as course taking sequences [11], or tracking the  semester performance by incoming characteristics can be  applied. Third, our analyses were only limited to undergraduate  engineering students. The curriculum for engineering students is  a relatively fixed sequence of courses. Other disciplines, both  STEM and non-STEM such as social sciences or humanities,  may have a much more complex structure of requirement  courses, more numbers of unique course combinations, and  different measurements for academic preparation that need to be  applied. Lastly, even though the demographic information was  not considered with the analysis of this paper, we believe that  integrating the demographic information with incoming  characteristics or concurrent course enrollment would be a  worthwhile investigation. For example, the location of high  school with AP exam results and high school GPA may be  related, and could help improve the precision of a course  recommendation system. However, care must be taken to ensure  that including such information does not recreate an existing  inequality (e.g., low female enrollment in STEM courses).    This preliminary study mainly focused on data exploration. It  may not answer every question that students or academic   24    advisors may encounter or prove the causal relationship between  the variables and students performance yet. Further analysis  that considers a wider range of students with more variables  would help to build a tool that can actually be used by an  advisor.    6.4 Future Research  In future investigations, we plan to expand the scope of the  analyses to include additional semesters and additional final  degrees, beginning with non-engineering STEM degrees.  Furthermore, analyzing the sequence of courses may be  necessary for expanding the scope to additional semesters. For  example, students may want to compare the possible outcomes  between taking Introduction to Engineering in this semester and  Introduction to Computers and Programming in following term,  and vice versa. Another example can be comparing when  students enroll in chemistry or physics lab courses non- concurrently with the corresponding lecture course.    Investigating when students enroll in particular courses can also  potentially affect academic success. The time off between the  fall semester and winter semester (winter vacation) is relatively  shorter than between winter semester and fall semester (summer  vacation). The difference in these gaps may be correlated with  the performance of courses that are related to each other. For  example, taking Calculus I and Calculus II in fall-winter  semester sequence may result in a higher success rate compared  to the case of winter-fall enrollment, since the shorter time  between courses may increase knowledge transfer between  courses. Also, taking courses in the summer semester may  further increase success rates as the summer semester class may  shorten the learning time gap that can occur during a long  summer vacation. Particularly with students who enroll in  courses like Pre-Calculus, it may be interesting to investigate  differences in future academic performance controlling for  whether students finish their required math courses more quickly  than others. Finally, we plan to study the effect of taking courses  at external institutions. Many students complete required core  courses at other institutions, such as local community colleges.  The effect of taking core required courses at other institutions  may be related to future course performance, such as the next  level physics course for particular engineering majors (e.g.,  Mechanical Engineering vs. Electrical Engineering).     7. CONCLUSION  This research is critical to not only building a course  recommendation system, but also better supporting students  through their chosen source of study and balancing that against  the wealth of knowledge that the institution has at its disposal  regarding those course selections. Providing students more  information about details of successful characteristics may raise  the ethical questions, such as replicating gender, ethnicity, or  socioeconomic differences in choosing courses. But it is also  true that students, properly scaffold, may understand those  trends and instead leverage the prior course and student success  history to maximize their own outcomes. As these analyses  become easier to conduct and automate, the institution may be  compelled to properly release these findings such that student  success can be optimized for every student, regardless of  demographics and incoming test scores [12].   8.

INTRODUCTION  This work describes a process by which personas can be created   from predictive models for the use of learning specialists. Unlike   other approaches [1] that focus on predictive modelling with the   learner or instructor in mind, our activity focuses on creating and   explaining a model that describes a particular group of learners   who may be of strategic importance to the institution. Our target   audience is institutional learning specialists, academic advisors or   instructional designers: individuals within higher education   systems who focus on creating large-scale, innovative learning   interventions. These interventions may be delivered in the form of   workshops, tutorials, help centers, online resources/activities or   other forms of personal coaching.   When dealing with learning specialists it is both important to   create an accurate predictive model as well as an explainable   predictive model. Achieving one of these goals may require a   trade-off with the other: to create an explainable model, one must   often reduce the accuracy of the model, while to create an   accurate model one must often include complex explanations of   learners. It is important to note the separation of roles we   envision: as data scientists building the predictive model we see   our role as enabling learning specialists to better understand the   student population that can be modelled. While we are often   forced to make decisions based on understanding of the   institutional questions being asked, we take the view that it is the   learning specialists who are best empowered to make pedagogical   and instructional decisions based on the particulars of a predictive   (classified) target population of learners.   To this end, our goal is to communicate both the nature and   likelihood of the learners who should be receiving interventions   (true positives), as well as learners who may be incorrectly   identified as needing interventions but do not (false positives).   Depending upon the intended intervention outcome, learning   specialists may choose more or less risky pedagogical methods   based on how accurately a group of learners can be modelled.    The approach we have taken to explaining predictive models is   that of learner personas: narrative descriptions of typical learners   that can be identified through centroids of machine learning   classification processes. The modelling methods we use are based   on historic data of learner activity, and can be used to predict the   activities of new learners at the institution. Once the rules inherent   in the predictive models have been used to classify groups of   learners, learners so classified can be offered particular   instructional/learning interventions.   The contribution this paper makes to the learning analytics   community is one of sense-making for practitioners. While   automated computer-based early alert systems have been powerful   agents in increasing retention and learning in higher education [1]   [2], we aim to use predictive models to enable human experts to   build, customize, and target educational programs for at risk   learners. Our goal is to describe a process and give examples of   how data scientists can better enable the exploration of the   middle space1 where learning-supports and analytics intersect in   higher education settings.                                                                       1 The middle space which exists at the intersection of   technology and learning has been recognized as a key concept   of interest and was the theme for the 2013 conference on   Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK13), see [7].

DATASET OVERVIEW  The examples given in this paper2 are inspired by an institutional   student records / admissions dataset that has been augmented with   entrance survey information. The institutional dataset includes a   variety of information including;    demographic information such as gender, nationality,  and self-declared disability status;    entrance information such as secondary school grades,  rural or urban backgrounds, and postal code data;    academic information such as program/degree  information, enrollment in courses, and grades in   courses.   In addition to this, the entrance survey asked students a variety of   questions about their backgrounds and plans for university, such   as;    whether they were planning to transfer colleges or  institutions during their undergraduate degree;    how they were funding their education;    how busy they expected their schedule to be, and  whether they were planning to volunteer or work part-  time throughout their degree;    their views on the responsibilities of the institution to  provide them with an education;    items to measure factors such as academic grit, help- seeking tendencies, and approaches to studying.   While some open ended questions were asked, for the purposes of   building predictive models only those questions that could be   represented as nominal, original, or real values were considered.   3. MODELLING PROCESS  The building of personas from this institutional data is part of a   five-step process.   3.1 Step 1: Dataset Reduction  The first step in building a predictive model is to identify the   kinds of attributes to be included in the model as well as the kinds   of learners for whom an intervention is to be created. Attributes   can be partitioned into three categories: those known at the time   one wishes to make a prediction and thus can be used to clarify   questions of interest (cut-off attributes), those known at the time   one wishes to make a prediction and are believed to be useful in   helping to make the prediction (predictive attributes), and those   known only after evaluating whether the learner has met the   criteria of interest (classification attributes).   For instance, one might want to describe those students who enter   the university with high academic achievement in secondary   education but fail to do well in their first year of university. To do   so, one would limit data from the institutional dataset where   students had high school averages (e.g. a cut off of 80% or higher,   or high SAT scores) and low first year grade point averages (e.g. a                                                                      2 It is important to note that all of the example fragments,   predictive models, and personas described in this paper are   simulated. While our underlying data is based on actual   experience building predictive models and personas from   institutional datasets, we removed identifying information and   instead aim to demonstrate the process and typical result instead   of providing explicit institutional personas.   grade point average of 65% or less at the end of their first   semester). The first of these values is a cut-off attribute, data that   is known at the beginning of an academic program that can be   used to remove students not being targeted for a particular   learning intervention. The second of these variables is a   classification attribute, only known post-hoc from previous data,   and is used to train the predictive model. Finally, other variables   in the survey and institutional datasets could be candidates for   being predictive attributes, which form the rules linking learners   to predictions.    Careful attention to identifying suitable cut-off and classification   attributes is important as these can reduce the size of the dataset   significantly. Under-specifying these attributes can cause large,   hard to understand models that tackle overly-broad questions.   Over-specifying these attributes can rob the predictive model of   its power  the model becomes a summary of data described by a   collection of constraints, which represent individual biases to   high-level questions instead of data-driven results. A more full   discussion of attribute reduction in predictive modelling can be   found in the literature [2].   In this example we aim to build a simple, binary predictive model    learners will be classified either as strong performers (e.g. they   entered the university with high grades and continued to achieve   these high grades), or weak performers (e.g. they entered the   university with high grades and achieved low grades after the first   semester). While predictive modelling does not have to be limited   to two categories, explaining higher dimension models with   personas becomes difficult because of misclassifications as   described in section 3.5.   3.2 Step 2: Building a Predictive Model  There are a variety of different tools and algorithms that can be   used for building predictive models, and the Weka toolkit [3] is a   free software package frequently used for this purpose. Once a   dataset has been reduced in size and classification has been run,   attention should be paid to the size of the classification groups.   For instance, the actual dataset we used to create the personas we   describe here was consisted of 30% weak performers and 70%   strong performers. Building a predictive model on such   unbalanced data can reduce accuracy, especially of the minority   group. While a complete treatment of the issues and solutions to   unbalanced datasets is outside of the scope of this work, we   suggest balancing the dataset using methods such as the Synthetic   Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) [4]. This technique   generates new, simulated instances in the minority dataset. In this   example, additional simulated students would be generated adding   to the individuals in the weak-performer set (the minority set).   The simulated students would share some combination of the   demographic and survey characteristics of other weak performers.    Table 1: Four candidate nodes for personas. Each node has a   misclassification rate of <=20% while classifying correctly at   least ten individuals.       Classifications    Correct Incorrect   Node 1 783 32   Node 2 57 14   Node 3 44 2   Node 4 35 0     It is important to only run SMOTE on attributes that are   independent of one another. Since SMOTE considers all of the   different values across the attributes in the minority set, it is   possible to generate instances which have combinations of   attributes that do not make sense. For instance, if there are   attributes for country of origin and state/province of origin in the   underlying data, SMOTE may generate synthetic instances   describing people from states and countries that are not related.   After applying SMOTE and achieving a balanced distribution of   learners in each category, it is possible to build a predictive model   such as a J48 decision tree. In this kind of model, leaf nodes of the   tree are classifications of learners (either strong or weak   performers), and paths to these leaf nodes form a series of rules   that describe the conditions by which a classification is formed.   Leaf nodes include a classification, the number of learners who   were correctly classified with that label (true positives), and the   number of learners with other labels who were misclassified as   belonging to this group (false positives). An example of such a   rule is shown in Figure 1.      3.3 Step 3: Uninteresting Classifications  Not all classifications are of equal value. For instance, if we are   interested in helping learning specialists build interventions for   the weak performers, then anyone who can be correctly identified   as a strong performer can be removed from our predictive model.   This is done through pruning of the decision tree, and any node   that is exclusively made up of strong performers can be removed,   along with the path to that node.   If the leaf node is made up predominantly but not completely of   strong performers, the data scientist faces the first tradeoff as to   whether they should leave the node in the model (high accuracy,   low explainability), or remove it (lower accuracy, high   explainability). If the node is removed, it reduces the complexity   of the model, but it introduces false negatives, since some of the   target learners (weak performers) are now excluded from the   predictive model. The trade-off here is between how much harm   is done by not intervening versus how much harm is done   intervening with the wrong persons. The decision to choose   between one route or the other depends on the initial question   being asked. If it is the perception of the data scientist that   missing a few interesting classifications is worth simplifying the   data model, then these nodes can be removed, and the interesting   classifications are now considered to be false negatives.   In our experience, we found that removing nodes that had very   high ratios of correct but uninteresting classifications to incorrect   but interesting classifications made the decision tree much easier   to understand. For instance, removing nodes made up   predominantly of strong performers where the number of   misclassifications is <=20% did not seem unreasonable, and   reduced the size of our decision tree considerably. In the synthetic   dataset we have uses for the purposes this this paper, where there   were 1400 classifications (after the SMOTE process), pruning   uninteresting classifications at the level of <=20% removed 524   strong performers from our dataset while only removing 33 weak   performers.   3.4 Step 4: Interesting Classifications  Our purpose in building a predictive model is to help learning   specialists create effective interventions for strategically important   groups of learners. As explained in section 3.5, we aim to describe   these groups of learners using personas. Personas can be separated   into two groups: affirmation personas, which describe a target   group of learners we are interest in having interventions designed   for (in our case, weak performers) and erroneous personas, which   describe classifications that the predictive model makes that we   are not focused on supporting (in our case, strong performers).   Nodes in the decision tree that are made up of mostly weak   performers are good candidates for affirmation personas. The best   affirmation personas are those that represent a large population   (large number of instances classified by a given node), and   contain few false positives (e.g. a high weak-performer to strong-  performer ratio). It is important to limit the number of affirmation   personas created to a small number so they remain memorable. In   our studies, we aimed for a maximum of three affirmation   personas per predictive model, though large models, which may   prove likely to have multiple interventions and involve larger   teams of learning specialists responsible for creating these   interventions, may benefit from more.   A difficult decision for the data scientist is to determine how large   the ratio of true positives to false positives can be before the node   should be rejected as a persona candidate. Beyond just the ratio of   correct to incorrect classifications, attention should be paid to the   total number of learners that have been classified at any particular   node. If there are very few learners classified at a leaf, it can   represent both an overfitting of the predictive model, as well as an   indication of poor prevalence in the dataset. Overfitting is a well-  studied problem in predictive modelling (see [5] for a discussion)   and is of strong importance for the data scientist, but determining   how many individuals a given learning design can be used for   depends on the pedagogical approach being used and the business   case. For our example we envisioned workshops being held for   those learners who were weak performers, so we required nodes   to have at least 10 individuals of the correct classification in order   to be considered, and required a correct classification rate of at   least 20%.   An important consideration when developing learning   interventions is the effect such interventions have on learners who   have been misclassified. In order to better understand the mixture   of learners that may receive interventions, we collapse the rest of   the nodes in the decision tree (which are made up of a variety of   persons in either the poor or good achievement groups) into a pair   of personas, one positive and one negative. These personas share   traits, but represent different student outcomes, and help to inform   learning designers as to the quality of the predictive model.   3.5 Step 5: Developing Personas  The outcome of the previous step is a relatively small set of   decision-tree leaf nodes, which are candidates for affirmation   personas. In our example, we identified four nodes, which covered   a cross-section of the student population (Table 1). As we were   creating personas for a small group of learning specialists who   aboriginal_status=2        distance_from_campus=3             wanting_to_transfer_college=1                  high_school_admission_avg<=91                       weak_performers (23,3)   Figure 1: An example rule produced by the data mining   process. Each attribute is defined in the oiginal dataset, and   the bottom line (a leaf node) represents the group of learners   classified when attribute conditions are met. In this case, the   classification is of weak learners, with 23 correctly classified   instances and 3 misclassified instances.     were aiming for a single intervention, we limited ourselves to two   personas. One node in particular contained a large number of   learners and had a low misclassification rate, so we chose this   node to represent our primary persona. Another node covered a   very small part of the population, but was a perfect classifier, so   we chose this to be our secondary persona. The other two nodes   were discarded.   Affirmation personas serve as examples to learning specialists of   the learners who might benefit from help. These personas serve as   examples and, while there is a danger in over-designing to a   persona, they are intended to reflect realistic proto-typical   individuals. In developing these personas, we follow the advice of   [6], and we also included the following design elements;   1. a colour positive image (e.g. smiling, happy) showing a  student who fit the demographic centroid of the group;   2. a narrative description, in bold text, of the attribute path  that described the classification rule for this group of   students;   3. a narrative description, in regular text, of the mean  attributes of this class that are not specified in the   classification rule (e.g. the prototype or centroid user in   this group)   Table 2: An example handout of the personas developed.  Stylistic choices such as colours, images, and text are intended to   make the personas easy to remember and easy to relate to. Some images iStock.com/alkir, gokychan, andresrimaging,   benstevens     Predictive models are rarely perfect and, depending upon the   intervention being designed, false positives can experience some   negative outcomes. For instance, if the institution attaches   mandatory extra course work to certain outcomes of predictive   models, students who are misclassified as false positives may end   up with an increased course load despite their lack of need for   help. As discussed in the next section, it is important to work with   learning specialists to construct interventions that take into   account the accuracy of predictive models.   It may be important to build erroneous personas as well, in order   to highlight the potential downside of interventions targeted at   false-positives. In our example, we chose one node that had both a   high number of classifications (5.8% of the total population) and a   fairly high number of misclassifications (22 learners which was   37% of the node population) for which to build an erroneous   persona. The erroneous persona was created similarly to the   affirmation personas, but two pictures were used, (one positive   image in colour for the correctly identified learners, and one   negative image in black and white for the misclassifications). The   narrative included describes how the learners are similar (the   predictive rule), and notes explicitly how the possible false-  positive classification could arise.   4.  DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS  While it may not be the job of data scientists to create learning   interventions, we think it is important to do some iterative work   with learning specialists during the design process. Personal   experience gained by learning specialists allows them to quickly   identify with the personas of learners and, in our experience, they   find familiarity with both the affirmation and erroneous personas.    Using the example presented here, the task facing a learning   specialist is to design an intervention that may be helpful for both   Bob, Sally, and potentially Ken while not being harmful for Jerry.   Typical learning interventions might be sending warning   messages to the students in the persona group, guiding the   students toward web resources, promoting specialized learning   resources, designing group workshops or short-courses for these   students, or arranging personal advising/counselling sessions.   These interventions vary in terms of their expense, invasiveness   and potential prejudicial outcomes. It is the responsibility of data   scientists to communicate the subtleties of the composition of the   persona group and likelihood of false positives. It is also   important to communicate the coverage of the persona groups  to   offer some indication of the number of false negatives.   Once persona groups have been created and interventions have   been designed, the data scientist can help with identifying the   actual learners predicted to be in the persona group and who   would be the targets of learning interventions.   5. USING PERSONAS FOR CRAFTING  EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES  A persistent problem facing learning specialists is how to know   whether or not learning interventions actually work (the program   evaluation problem). If a specialized workshop or course is   designed and delivered and outcomes are measured, it is hard to   know what would have transpired had the intervention not been   made. Our work on personas provides one potential solution to   this problem: The set of learners identified to constitute a persona   group can readily be assigned randomly into a treatment and   control sub-group. The treatment group can be offered the   designed learning intervention, while the control group can be left   with no intervention (or offered the intervention at a later time,   perhaps). The achievement difference between treatment and   control groups offers strong experimental evidence of the effect of   the given learning intervention. While there may be some ethical   issues associated with withholding learning interventions from   control group subjects, the idea of a later offering of the   intervention can satisfy some concerns. Once answered, the   question of the effectiveness of a learning intervention for a   highly specific group of learners is a very powerful result.   6. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK  In our work to date, we have attempted to bring data scientists and   learning specialists together to gather better demographic data,   build predictive models, communicate those models in terms of   personas and persona groups, design interventions for actual   groups of learners, and design program evaluation experiments.   The success of the persona work will be measured through the   improved ability of our learning specialists to create or utilize   existing learning interventions in a more strategic and cost-  effective manner, targeting resources and efforts toward more   narrowly defined groups of students. The success will also be   validated through experimental differential interventions.    Predictive models are useful only if they can be made actionable.   Our work on personas offers a way to make such models   actionable by enabling learning specialists to do their jobs better.   7.

INTRODUCTION  Learning Analytics (LA) is an ecosystem of methods and  techniques (in general procedures) that successively gather,  process, report and act on machine-readable data on an ongoing  basis in order to reflect on learning processes [1]. Like any other  context-aware system, the LA procedures monitor, track and  record data related to the context, interpret and map the real  current state of these data, organise these data (e.g., filter,  classify, prioritise), use these data (e.g., decide adaptations,   recommend, provide feedback, guide the learner) and predict the  future state of these data [2]. The target is to inform and empower  learners, instructors and organization about performance and goal  achievement, and facilitate decision making accordingly.    Prediction of performance is a challenging task for institutions,  instructors and learners. Accurate and up-to-date predictions  could have significant effect on strategic adjustments that could  lead to improved learning outcomes and increased goal  achievement. A number of case studies explore, identify and  evaluate factors as indicators of performance that are more  significant for prediction purposes. These factors include  demographic characteristics, grades (either on course assignments  or final exams scores), students portfolios, students  participation, enrollment and engagement in activity and students  mood and affective states [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].    Research shows a significant positive relationship between  participation and grades [10]. Performance is also related to the  type, content and nature of both formative and summative  feedback students receive during formative assessment [7, 11].    Another possible factor for predicting performance, yet not  extensively explored in literature, is the temporal dimension of  students engagement in activity. Xiong et al. [12] applied  machine learning and statistical analysis to examine the effect of  students response time on the prediction of their performance and  how response time could be used.    In a former study [13] the authors examined the results of  students time-spent studying on their academic performance and  evaluated the interaction of motivation with study time. The  results were encouraging and shown a relationship between  motivation and study time.  Additionally, Beal and Cohen [14]  experimented with modeling the amount of time students are  willing to spend on problems and how it changes over the course  of a session (pg. 67). In their work, the authors modeled  unobservable factors such as engagement, using hidden variable  models.   Furthermore, in the context of Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT),  the orientation information includes time among others [15]. In  this case, the goal is the adaptation engine to apply the adaptation  with respect to the orientation information, in order to support the  examinee. The author gives examples of how and what the engine  should adapt regarding orientation to time.   Within this paper we explore the predictive capabilities of  students time-spent on answering (in-)correctly each question of  a multiple choice assessment quiz, along with students final quiz- score. Our goal is to investigate whether time-spent on correct   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies  bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

We define this procedure as temporal  learning analytics. Furthermore, we discovered a relationship  between temporal learning analytics and students goal  expectancy. In our work, we present the results from a case study  with 96 participants, as well as future research dimensions.    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we  present our experiment methodology. In section 3, we analyze the  results from the case study. In section 4, we discuss about our  findings, share our initial conclusions and describe our future  work plans.   2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 Experiment Process and Data Collection  For our case study we used a simplified version of the LAERS  assessment environment [1]. We developed a new module that  consists of two components:   a) a computer-based testing unit in multiple choice quiz   format, and  b) a tracker that logs students activity data.   The testing unit displays the multiple choice quiz with a  predefined (by the instructor), stable (for all examinees) number  of questions and of fixed duration. Each question is displayed  separately and one-by-one. During the quiz, the student can skip a  question (either because he/she is not sure about the answer, or  because he/she thinks it is difficult), and answer it later. The list  of skipped questions is displayed alongside the quiz, within the  same window. The student temporarily saves his/her answers on  the quiz questions, before finalizing his/her decision. The student  can also change his/her initial choice, and save a new answer.  He/she submits the quiz answers only once, whenever estimates  that he/she is ready to do so, within the duration of the exam. In  case a student chooses not to submit an answer to a question,  he/she receives zero points for this question. Students submitted  answers are stored on a database.   The second component records students activity data during  testing. In specific, the tracker logs for each student the following  parameters:    quest_id: the question the student works on,    ans_id: the answer the student submits on a question,     rw: the correctness of the submitted answer (right or wrong),     count_view: how many times the student views each  question,     count_changes: how many times the student changes the  answer he/she submits for each question,    idle_t_view: the time the student spends on viewing each  question (not saving an answer),     t_ans: the time the student spends on answering each question  (saves an answer).   Figure 1 illustrates the students view of the environment during  testing.      Figure 1. The LAERS environment during testing   The system also calculates a) the Final Score (that is the Actual  Performance - AP) for each student, and b) average time values  for each question and each student. Students data and quizs data  are stored on a database, but tracked activity data are stored on a  log file (results.csv).   We also embedded into the system a pre-test questionnaire in  order to measure each students goal expectancy. Data from the  questionnaire were logged on a separated file (pretest.csv).  Data were collected from a total of 96 participant students of a  European High School, aged 16 years old. 9 groups of 10 to 12  students attended the midterm exams, for 30 minutes each group,  from 2nd to 7th of October 2013. The 12 multiple choice  questions of the test were related to the basic concepts of  Computer Science. The final log file (results.csv) contained 4133  rows of raw data.   2.2 Research model and Hypotheses  Based on previous studies, this paper goes a step further by  introducing time and students perceptions as significant  predictors of actual performance.  Total_time_answer_correct (TTAC):  We define TTAC as the total time that a student spends on  viewing the questions and submitting the correct answers. We  believe that a student who spends more time for choosing the  correct answers is more likely to have better performance. In  specific, a student that answers correctly many questions will  aggregate more and more time to TTAC.  Therefore, we  hypothesized:  H1: TTAC will have a positive effect on Actual Performance  Total_time_answer_wrong (TTAW):   We define TTAW as the total time that a student spends on  viewing the questions and submitting the wrong answers. We  believe that a student who spends more time for choosing the  wrong answers is more likely to have lower performance. In  specific, a student that answers incorrectly many questions will  aggregate more and more time to TTAW.  Thus, we hypothesized:  H2: TTAW will have a negative effect on Actual Performance  The total time is the aggregation of the above two time units.  Goal Expectancy (GE)  A variable which measures self-confidence and goal orientation  regarding the use of a Computer Based Assessment is Goal   32    Expectancy (GE), which was proposed in Computer Based  Assessment Acceptance Model (CBAAM) [16]. GE has two  dimensions. The first dimension is students preparation to take  the CBA. GE actually measures if a learner is fulfilled with  his/her preparation. The second dimension includes the desirable  level of success for each student. The students, before taking the  CBA, set a goal regarding a percentage of correct answers that  provides them a satisfying performance. We believe that GE is  highly positively correlated with the TTAC. The reason is that a  well prepared student will answer more questions correctly;  therefore the time that he/she will spend for the correct answers  will be higher than the spending time of a poorly prepared  student. On the contrary, a well prepared student will have fewer  wrong answers than a poorly prepared student. Consequently, a  well prepared student will spend less time on questions that  finally will answer wrong. Therefore, GE is expected to have a  negative impact on TTAW.    Thus, we hypothesized:   H3: GE will have a positive effect on Total Time to answer  correct.   H4: GE will have a negative effect on Total Time to answer  wrong.   To summarize, this paper develops and explores a causal model to  determine students Actual Performance (Figure 2).     Figure 2. Research Model   2.3 Measures  In order to examine the constructs of the model, we used data  collected with modified LAERS [1], and we also adapted three  items from the questionnaire to measure Goal Expectancy [16]. In  specific, these three items are:    GE1: Courses preparation was sufficient for the CBA    GE2: My personal preparation for the CBA    GE3: My performance expectations for the CBA   We used the technique of partial least-squares (PLS) analysis to  evaluate the measurement and the structural model. Previous  studies supported that PLS is a powerful tool to develop and test  theories in early stages, and to predict with small samples [17, 18,  19].   PLS follows two guidelines regarding the sample size. The first is  that the sample has to be 10 times larger than the number of items  for the most complex construct. The second is that the sample has  to be 10 times the largest number of independent variables  impacting a dependent variable [19].  The most complex variable  of the proposed model is GE with three items. Therefore, the  sample of 96 participants surpassed the recommended value of 30.   Reliability and validity of the measurement model are proved by  measuring the internal consistency, convergent validity and  discriminant validity [20]. In our proposed model the  measurement model analysis is necessary mainly for GE which is  the only latent variable. More specifically, a value higher than 0.7  is acceptable regarding the items factor loadings on the  corresponded constructs. In order to analyze discriminant validity,  we have also to examine AVE (Average Variance Extracted).  AVE should be higher than 0.5 and the AVEs squared root of  each variable should be larger than any correlation with every  other construct [18, 19, 20]. Finally, Composite reliability and  Cronbach alpha should be also examined. Composite reliability  and Cronbach alpha are considered acceptable when they scored  over 0.7 [21, 22].   The structural model and hypotheses are examined mainly by two  criteria:    (1) by evaluating the variance measured for (R2) by the  antecedent constructs. Previous studies suggested 0.2, 0.13  and 0.26 as small, medium and large variance respectively  [23];    (2) the significance of the path coefficients and total effects by  using bootstrapping procedure and calculating the t-values.    In order to examine the measurement and the structural model we  used SmartPLS 2.0 [24].   3. Results  Table 1 confirms the adequate values for the measurement model.    Table 1.

The diagonal  elements are the square root of the average variance extracted  (AVE) of a construct. Discriminant validity is confirmed since the  diagonal elements are higher than any correlation with another  variable.   Table 2.

The  results for the hypotheses are summarized in Table 3 and  illustrated in Figure 3. TTAC and TTAW have significant direct  positive and negative effect on AP respectively. Moreover GE is a  determinant of TTAC and TTAW as well. Thus all the hypotheses  were confirmed.    33    Table 3.

Path coefficients of the research model   Additional to the direct effects, the structural model includes also  indirect effects (Table 4).   Table 4.

The model explains almost the 62%  of the variance in AP. The total effects of TTAC (0.60), of TTAW  (-0.29) and GE (0.28) are strong.    4. DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND  FUTURE WORK  The principal idea of this work is to introduce the temporal data  regarding the development of more personalized and fully  automated systems. In this paper we explored the predictive  capabilities of temporal learning analytics regarding Actual  Performance a student achieves during computer based testing.  The temporal interpretation of students performance in activity,  attempted here, could be used for predicting their progress. In  other words, interpreting students participation and engagement  in terms of time-spent could lead to a complementary  dimension of a more concise predictive model.   For the needs of our experiment we configured the LAERS  system and implemented additional components. 96 students from  Secondary Education participated in our case study, in order to  estimate the validity of our hypotheses. Next, we used the PLS  technique to evaluate the measurement and the structural model.   Our initial results indicate three main contributions: a) a direct  positive effect of total time to answer correct on AP, b) a direct  negative effect of total time to answer wrong on AP, and c) an  indirect effect of GE on AP.   In specific, our preliminary results highlight a detected trend that  temporal learning analytics have a statistically significant  capability on predicting actual performance (almost 62% of the  variance). In particular, TTAC has a direct positive effect (0.60)   on AP. This means that if a learner spends more time to answer  correctly, it is more likely to score higher. Moreover, TTAW has  a direct negative effect (-0.29) on AP. This means that if a learner  spends more time to answer incorrectly, it is more likely to score  lower.   In case this finding is verified by further experiments, it could  indicate that temporal learning analytics could replace traditional  grading in assessment activities where grades act as effort  overload. In these activities, an hourglass visualization  (indicating real-time TTAC/TTAW) could be embedded into the  CBA system to inform learners (and instructor) about their  progress and performance.   Furthermore, the third finding has two additional inherent  dimensions: a) there is a positive effect of GE on TTAC, and b)  there is a negative effect of GE on TTAW. Our model  demonstrates that GE is a direct strong determinant of the  temporal variables and concurrently an indirect strong  determinant of AP (Table 4).  Although someone would expect such results, there are no other  research studies that provide evidence. Our findings indicate that  the temporal dimension of students participation in assessment  activities could be acknowledged as a predictive factor of  performance.   However, since this research is one of the first that introduce  temporal dimension to predict performance, further research  should be applied to verify our results.   As stated on section 2.2, Goal Expectancy is a dimension of  students perceptions, and in the context of this case study, GE is  about the students perception of preparation. It would be very  interesting to investigate the correlation between students  perception of performance and his/her actual performance. It  would be important to detect the temporal factors that determine  students perception of performance. Further, these factors could  be measured and embodied in the structural model as additional  parameters.  In addition, students self-confidence and certainty during testing  constitute two parameters that could also be explored through  their temporal instantiation. It would be interesting to examine the  relationships between these behaviors and the total idle time a  student spent on a question, or how many times he/she skipped a  question.  Further, the proposed ideas should be examined and combined  with other features such as learners characteristics (e.g. gender,  age, personality traits) and different infrastructures (e.g.  universities) [2, 26, 27].  To conclude, we believe that this approach could be exploited for  the construction of more sophisticated CBA systems that record  the temporal behavior of their users, analyze this information and  adapt their functionalities accordingly, in order to improve the  users performance.   5.

INTRODUCTION What is a good indicator of comprehension Not all stu-  dents are willing to participate during the class period. At times the most passive of students can surprise you with their knowledge, and the most active students will under- achieve. But how to see this during the class when you have the best chance of correcting a misconception in the lectures material  Our goal is to provide teachers with a new view of the classroom, one that lets them assess the impact of their lec- ture. This is important because the element that will change on every lecture is the audience mood - and the lecture needs  Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for per- sonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The adjust- ment of the teaching style can prove to be a challenging task for a novice teacher. While aiming to give each student the amount of attention needed to learn qualitatively, we would like to point the lecturer to the parts of the classroom which he or she is not engaging in the lecture. But with all the different styles of lecturing, how to measure performance without crippling the teachers with technological aids that distract more then help  Our approach is based on the attempt to formalize pure observation. Without overloading the students with gadgets and formally structured procedures that dictate a certain format of the learning experience, we start with a system of cameras and measurements of human activity in its most basic form - movement.  In this paper we present the method for measuring move- ment in a class and the procedure used to relate the gathered information to the students subjective perception of atten- tion. The main contribution is the concept of measuring the speed of student reactions in class to detect the students with lower attention. The concept is based on the idea that the students who are focused on the lecture would react at the moment the important information was presented, while the distracted students will be slower to note it. This is the concept that we call the sleepers lag. The higher the vari- ance of reaction time to the stimuli (in our case - teachers presentation) - the lower the attention of the classroom. In order not to introduce some artificial measuring points dur- ing the lecture we propose to compare students against each other in a dyadic fashion.  Our other conclusions go further into exploration on how the geometry of the classroom and immediate surroundings affect the individual student. This sets up the ground for the student-centred observation of the classroom, as op- posed to the dominant trend of exploration which consider the teacher as the only stimulus present in the classroom of approximately fifty persons (to which we refer to asteacher- centric).  1.1 Theoretical Background Traditional classrooms (in both talk format and seating  configuration) remain the dominant format of lecturing on all levels of formal education today. There have been many critiques on the format, saying that classrooms geograph- ical configuration makes it difficult to develop the teacher- student relationship and understanding beyond stereotypes [17]. And while some claim that the current organizational setup evolved into existence for practical reasons [20] we  36    a) b)  Figure 1: Motion intensity graphs.

Person 2 shifted hers seating position (blue line), 2 seconds later, neighbouring Person 1 (marked in green) also started re- adjusting herself. b) Motion of a single person (dark green trace) overlayed over the average motion of the whole classroom (gray trace). Horizontal red line marks the 30% threshold that we used for movement analysis. Color-coded labels on top indicate different events during the class, as described in Section 3.2. Annotations present here are: Blue rectangles - slide chage; Red periods - question answering periods or questionnaire filling periods; Green vertical lines - slide animations  cant ignore difficulties that teachers are facing with keep- ing students attention over time [31][22] and on-task[27].  The set of theories we group under the name teacher- centric focus on teacher and the teachers impact on the classroom. As the primary orchestrator of the learning pro- cess [10][11], teachers take on the responsibility that starts from educational presentation, pedagogical guidance [7] to the level of students personal transformation [30]. Teachers role in the classroom has been characterized as emotional labour [17] and cognitively demanding [13]. In many oc- casions a good teacher is characterized with the ability to present the teaching material in a way that is acceptable to students, and this has been shown to be the major difference between a novice and a experienced teacher [4], confirming the need for the teacher to be a reflective practitioner [28]. The final conclusion drawn from this small sample of stud- ies on teachers is that teaching is a job of high responsibility and mental demand.  Teachers still need to go beyond the instinctive reactions [19] in order to reach all the students. The geometry of the classroom, as mentioned before, was already presented as an emotional barrier for more natural interaction [17]. Students in the front rows are perceived as more interested[8]. Ma- jority of communication is oriented to the T-shaped region with the highest concentration of interaction focused on the front-center of the classroom [1]. The effect does not only af- fect the teachers perception, but students also adjust to the geometry of the classroom, and the students who seek inter- action will tend to sit in the high-interaction places [3]. Its also shown that the seating arrangement will act as an am- plification of students interactions - making high-verbalizers more active in the high-interaction zone, and making low- verbalizers even less active in the low-interaction zone (the edge regions of the classroom) [20]. The classroom environ- ment greatly affects the perception of the teacher and stu- dents, but this doesnt always go in favour of the learning process.  Being far away from the teacher goes beyond just teach- ers perception. On the student-centric side of research, Daum [9] found that distance from the teacher also has a  real effect on the success of the students. Irrespective of the position or grades, students have difficulty maintaining the attention during the whole duration of the class [27]. Even if its not clearly quantifiable after how much time students lose attention, proposed measurements between 10 minutes [31] and 20 minutes [22] are far less then the av- erage duration of class period. Finn et al. [14] found that smaller class sizes (less then 15 students) affect the quality of the lecture in two ways - the teachers took less time to manage the learning process, but more importantly the stu- dents interaction between themselves also changed for the better. As the students grow up in the school system, the relationship between the teacher and the students becomes less emotionally involved [17] and their participation in the classroom activities decreases [21]. This seems closely re- lated to students becoming more accustomed to studying in a large group, where individual visibility is questioned [14] and situation is easy for diffusion of responsibility and so- cial loafing [15]. Its common for the students to have more practical goals than purely academic improvement [2].  Our research aims to scaffold teachers perception of the students and raise awareness about students reception of the lecture. Some of the current methods of dealing with the problem use web-oriented solutions [12], feedback devices in form of a clicker[6] or mobile phone application [26]. We look up to the research of unobtrusive measurements [29] in order not to disturb the classroom eco-system.  2. THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS Our initial hypothesis for the experiment was that we can  detect agreeing groups of students by common behavior pat- terns and that the people in the visible surroundings affect the person (student) by their non-verbal cues. We consid- ered body language in its most basic form and compared the cooccurances of motion between pairs of students. We also related our observations to students level of attention.  From the dual eye-tracking theory, we know that the qual- ity of collaboration [24] and understanding [18] between two persons can assessed by analysing the consistency of their gaze patterns. We draw an analogy with these conclusions in  37    a) b)  Figure 2: Synchronization between two persons over a period of 30 minutes. a) Motion of Person 1 (P1) over time is shown on the horizontal edge and motion of Person 2 (P2) is shown on the vertical edge. The matrix itself represents multiplication of motion intensities of respected moments on P1s and P2s timeline. We disregard the motion intersections which are temporarily too far apart and process only the diagonal which is zoomed in on b). In figure b) horizontal axis represents time from P1s perspective and the vertical dimension represents time offset of the motion of P2 in the following way: i) top line indicated P2 moving 4 seconds before P1 ii) second line indicates P2 moving 2 seconds before P1 iii) P1 and P2 moved at the same time iv) P2 moved 2 seconds after P1 v) P2 moved 4 seconds after P1  the domain of motion in the classroom, with the hypothesis that students who listen to the teacher will be more likely to move in synchronized manner, while an absent-minded student will act on his/hers own internal rhythm. Synchro- nized motion is not limited to any specific action, but can be explained on the example of taking notes - attentive stu- dents would turn pages on the hand-outs and note important facts as they are presented in class. More than a reaction to the lectures audio/visual stimulus, motion can be seen as an agreement of the audience. If the students agree that an event outside the classroom (e.g. loud noise, truck) is more important then the lecture, they would still have a synchro- nized motion (everybody looking through the window) but caused by a different stimulus than the teacher.  Synchronization in the class was studied in a dyadic fash- ion, by comparing pairs of any two students. Depending on relative location between the two students we divided the dyads into three conditions based on their mutual visibility (as described in Section 3.3).  Given that learning is not a strictly formalized activity, re- actions of students can vary or be completely blank. In dual eye-tracking, a delay of 2 seconds between the speakers and listeners gaze during the moments of referencing has been identified [25], with the conclusion that the comprehension between participants is inversely proportional to the time- lag. Based on this, we define two movements of the students as co-movement if it happens within 4 seconds from each other (depicted in Figure 1a). We differentiate between i) perfect synchronization (< 2 sec apart), ii) synchronization (2-4 sec apart), iii) weak synchronization (4-6 sec apart). Three periods are displayed on the Figure 2b as the vertical axis.  The additional, third, period was introduced to take into account indirect synchronization - when the person is not reacting to the teachers stimulus but is following the reaction of others, in which we add 2 seconds for the person to observe  the reaction of others and then reproduce it. This is what we call the sleepers lag - the idea that the persons who are mimicking attention instead of actually paying attention will have a delay (a lag) in their actions.  3. METHOD Our setup and method for gathering data is novel in the  classroom environment. We will describe the main points of the technological part of the method, cover the data- gathering methodology and our current working sample.  3.1 Motion Analysis Analysis of the motion is based on tracking feature points  in the video [5]. Our setup consists of three cameras used for coverage of the students and one observing the teachers actions. Initial steps of analysis - synchronization of video streams from all sources and annotating visible regions in which students reside during the lecture are described in [23].  Our main challenges in the process of extracting a mea- surement of motion for further analysis were i) inter-personal occlusions, ii) perspective distortion, iii) normalization of the amount of movement recorded from a single person into a comparable measurement between several persons.  i) Inter-personal occlusions are handled by taking several pre-processing steps before assigning the motion to a person. The main idea is that by grouping the motion vectors into motion tracks, we can more reliably assign the whole track to a single person, instead of taking each motion vector as an isolated measurement.  Steps of the process are illustrated in Figure 3. Raw mo- tion vectors are shown in Figure 3a as purple arrows whose intensities add to the amount of motion of one person at one time instance. Motion vectors (v) are next grouped into tracks (T ) which consist of cloud of motion vectors over several frames. The criteria for grouping is based on prox-  38    a) b) c)  Figure 3: Motion detection and grouping. a) Individual motion vectors shown as purple arrows b) Motion vectors grouped over time into motion tracks which can be assigned to an individual c) Marked student areas and centres of Gaussian probabilities which model the probability of motion belonging to each student.  imity, direction similarity and intensity of the vectors. For visualisation purposes, a set of cloud centres from several frames are connected into a track which is shown in Fig- ure 3b. Finally the entire track is assigned to the student of highest probability (gf ) defined by Formula 1. Each student (g) has a Gaussian distribution centred on the position of his head (depicted in Figure 3c). The entire track is assessed over every center (i.e. student) and motion is assigned to the student with the highest probability.  gf = arg max g   vT  p(v|g) (1)  In cases where a student was occluded on more than 80% of tracked area the movements were undistinguishable from the person in front of him/her. Depending on the quality of the measurements for the person in front, either one or both students were removed from further processing if they were below a set threshold.  Taking into account that our primary interest was motion between students, it is important to notice that this method was designed so that   a motion occurring between two students would not be assigned to both students   large motions spanning several tracked areas would be assigned to a single person, and not to a group of peo- ple.  ii) Perspective distortion To compensate for the per- spective effect, the number of tracking points remains con- stant over all annotated tracked areas. Second measure was to normalize the intensity of the motion vector by the diago- nal of the student region. This ensures that the hand-motion of the student in the back row will be registered with the same intensity as the hand-motion of the student in the first row.  iii) Normalizing the amount of motion Normalizing the motion of a person has proven to be difficult. We based our normalization on two premises i) student is on average sitting still during the class ii) student has at least one full- body movement in the recorded footage (e.g. pose shift). To scale this to a range of 0-100% motion, we take the median value of movement intensity as the 5% motion (which corre- sponds to small motion/sitting still being registered as 5% motion), and we verify that given this basic motion intensity the student reaches 100% motion at least once during the class. Motion which registers above the threshold of 100% is  clipped to the maximum value. The final motion intensity over time can be visualized as shown in Figure 1b.  3.2 Experimental procedure We observed each lecture for the duration of 30 minutes.  After a random interval (average duration 7 minutes) a tone signal was given which interrupted the lecture. At that time the students were asked to fill out a questionnaire sampling their activities and self-reported perception of the classroom.  In addition to student samples, we hand-annotated events during the class, which were a product of teachers action or a teacher-student interaction. Events were annotated into following categories: i) slide change ii) slide animation iii) Question begin/end period iv) Answer begin/end period v) Other events. Our questionnaire filling periods (which typi- cally lasted around 1 minute) were designated as Question answering periods. Since they dont represent a normal part of a lecture, student activity in those periods were not taken into consideration in further analysis of data. The events are shown as annotations in the top part of the time- line visualization in Figure 1b.  3.2.1 Questionnaires By using a 10-point Likert scale, participants were regis-  tering their   attention level,   perception of the teacher (energetic/boring),   perception of the classroom attention (high/low),   importance of the material being presented (impor- tant/irrelevant).  In addition to this, the questionnaire enumerated activities that the students did during the previous time-period:   listening,   taking notes,   repeating key ideas,   thinking about other things,   interacting with people around you (which was not scheduled by the classroom activity),   using your laptop/phone.  Students could check more than one activity.  39    3.2.2 Student sample We base our results on analysis of two classes, described in  Table 1. Both student groups were in the bachelor program of EPFL, Switzerland. The teachers were two experienced lecturers teaching on subjects from social sciences in case of Class 1 and technical sciences in Class 2. The lectures were given in different times of the day - one being in the morning, the other in the late afternoon time, and in different rooms.  Class Size Analysed Female rat. Rows Columns 1 38 29 36.8% 6 7 2 18 14 22.2% 4 5  Table 1: Basic information about analysed classes  Even though we initially consider both classes compara- ble, small number of students in the second class rendered conclusions from that observation to be statistically invalid. We show the results found in the Class 2 sample here to demonstrate that there is a consistent trend in both cases.  3.3 Location and surroundings One of our main considerations when thinking how the  student perceives the lecture and came from proxemic zones [16]. Since the perception of the teacher changes significantly depending on how far they are from the front, we decided against normalizing the space in the way it was done for [1], which would allow us to make one big sample by making the two classes comparable.  Emulating the proxemics concept in the classroom envi- ronment we defined 3 zones depicted in Figure 4:   immediate neighbour - which models personal space. Person to the immediate left or right of the student, with whom the student shares the desk-space and leg- space. This is partially dictated by the dimensions of the student desks which are made for two persons per desk;   visible neighbourhood - represents the zone of two rows in front of the student 2 persons wide. This rep- resents the social zone of proxemics theory (which spans from 1.2m - 3m). The zone practically mod- els the people who would be intentionally or uninten- tionally observed by the student whos following the material on the slides or looking towards the teacher;   non-visible students - students who are either too far to the side or behind the individual and can not be seen without intentional action.  4. OBSERVATIONS  4.1 Questionnaire data The collected questionnaire data was used primarily as  the basis for further analysis of the collected video material. Nevertheless we report the condensed findings to depict the general situation in the classrooms. A general note on the findings is that because of the small number of samples, we are reporting our findings with Kendalls correlation.  Reported levels of attention in both cases were high, with the mean shifted to around 7. In case of Class 1  =  Figure 4: Organization of classroom zones and units of measurements, top of the image represents the front of the classroom. v,h - vertical and horizontal spacing between students is 1 unit of distance (uod) in our current setup. s - between-row spacing, 1 uod. d - distance between the professor (center-front of the classroom) and the analysed student.

There is a significant correlation between the personal level of attention and the perceived level of attention of the entire class (Class 1  = 0.477 (p < 0.05); Class 2  = 0.413 (p < 0.05)). We considered this to be an interesting way of expressing dissatisfaction with personal or class perfor- mance in way that the student would mark bigger difference between personal and classroom attention if there is a bigger dissatisfaction with the learning conditions.  Classes were perceived by participants as exhibiting both high teacher-energy and high levels of student attention.  Class Class attention Teacher energy mean (variance) mean (variance)  1 6.776 (3.711) 7.783 (1.866) 2 7.125 (3.266) 8.347 (1.920)  Table 2: Parameters of perceived class quality  Activities students reported (shown in Figure 6) show an expected tendency to report material related activities (lis- tening to lecture, taking notes and repeating ideas) in higher attention levels. Off-task activities (thinking about other things, talking to others) were reported on all levels up to the maximum level of attention. Note that the students in Class 2 were using tablets as part of their regular studies to view the class material, while that was not required for Class 1.  We also studied the variation of attention levels over time in hope of capturing the reported drop of concentration after 10 minutes [31], but found no clear trend.  40    a)  b)  Figure 5: Average attention of students in both classes was subjectively perceived as high. a) Class 1 ( = 6.822,  = 2.344) and b) Class 2 ( = 7.444,  = 1.100)  4.2 Motion data We compared the number of synchronized movements dur-  ing the class period. Synchronized movement is defined as body movement with more than 30% intensity from each of the two persons being compared (shown as the horizontal red line in Figure 1b). The 30% threshold was taken to sep- arate minor body movements and motion that is likely to be noticed by others. We took into consideration the visibility of two persons, meaning that in order for the movement of Person 1 to be considered as stimulus, it has to be visible to Person 2. Visibility reasoning was done based on the sitting location of the two persons.  We compared the average number of synced movements between pairs sitting immediately next to each other (marked as the dark-blue region in Figure 4) and other pairs. We found that immediate neighbours had higher probability of synchronized moving than a non-neighbouring pair with a t-test (p  0.05), shown in Table 3.  We analysed but found no significant difference in number  a)  b)  Figure 6: Percentage of activities per attention level in a) Class 1 and b) Class 2.

To compare the motion metrics with the previous findings of Adams [1] on student activity, we also tested the influence of teachers proximity to the movement of the students. The further away students are from the front-center of the class- room (the point which is the closest to the teacher in both cases, represented as distance d in Figure 4) the less active they are (Kendall correlation is  = 0.284 (p = 0.03) for Class 1; and  = 0.172 (p = 0.45) for Class 2). Analysing the samples we have seen the same trend in both cases, even  41    Figure 7: Correlation between distance from teacher and motion intensity in Class 1; Kendall correlation  = 0.284 (p = 0.03)  tough the correlation was insignificant for the second class- room. Figure 7 shows the correlation for Class 1.  Our third test was to find the correlation of the aver- age reported level of attention to the reaction speed. The question was whether students with lower attention levels were more likely to lag behind a other students in their vis- ible field. The correlation found had the expected trend in Kendall correlation  = 0.259 but was marginally insignif- icant (p = 0.06) on the sample size of 29 students of the Class 1. The result is shown in Figure 8. Class 2 correla- tion had a similar trend but was not statistically significant  = 0.222 (p = 0.32). The data thus suggests that there is a phenomenon of sleepers lag, but the current sample is not conclusive. Also, the difference in average speed of re- action is in sub-second intervals, which leads us to question if this would be noticeable to the teachers eye without the technological enhancement of the classroom.  5. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we demonstrated our concept of measuring  speed of reaction in the student population of classroom. We gave insight about the subjective perception of the class- room attention gathered with the questionnaire, and shown that the students will project their level of attention onto others in their reports. Our first conclusion about existing synchronization of motion between immediate neighbours shows that there might be an underlying reason for this, and that two persons can affect each other just by sitting together without actual direct interaction.  We found a similarity with previous studies on the affect of teacher proximity on students [1] and found that students who are further away not only participate less, but also move less.  Finally, we proposed a new way of evaluating the overall attention of the classroom by comparing pairs of students and analysing how synchronous they move. By comparing the motion results to the data gathered in the questionnaire we showed that there is a correlation between slower reaction time and lower levels of reported attention - the sleepers  Figure 8: Average motion lag compared with the average level of attention in Class 1.

We havent touched on the subject of presenting the infor-  mation to the teachers during the lecture, and were plan- ning on starting a dialogue with the participating teachers to find the best representation for displaying the information during the lecture. Our next steps are to confirm the find- ings on a broader sample of students and continue to refine the technological methods. In addition to the sleepers lag we would also like to explore further the phenomenon which we call thedistraction ripples - assuming the transitivity of the motion-syncing, we would like to capture the spreading of influence of one class-member to people around him/her. We are also interested to correlate how well do these rip- ples spread in high-attention and low-attention groups of students, in order to make a new metric of class attention.  In addition to motion, we aim to introduce additional cues into our reasoning about student attention and perception of the class, specifically - gaze direction. The end goal is to have a holistic image of the classroom life in order to find the most salient cues that can be unobtrusively collected. Our intention is that in the end, the entire system would act as a training experience for the novice teachers.  Stepping back from the trend of individual learning with massive on-line open courses (MOOCs), classrooms remain the dominant form of lecturing on all educational levels. In- troducing technological solutions to the classroom has the potential of huge impact on the way the students learn. By not excluding the teachers but supplementing their obser- vations with advanced measurements we hope to create a blend which would be superior to the current methods and beneficial for both students and teachers.  6.

INTRODUCTION  Throughout the history of education, there has been interest in  designing classrooms for children that best support effective  pedagogy. The goal has been to select spatial designs for  childrens classrooms that likely influence both pedagogy and  experience in meaningful fashions [21]. Much of the literature in  this area has considered the layout of desks and students, such as  whether desks point to the teacher, or students sit in circles facing  each other [13]. Another theme has been the visual design of the  classroom. Colorfully decorated walls have become a staple of  modern classrooms [8]. There has been steady interest in the  impacts of differences in the design and utilization of classroom  walls [9], which students look towards for hours a day [26].  Differences in classroom design can have substantial impacts on  student engagement and learning. In specific, Weinstein [28]  found that extensive shelving and clearer display of materials  reduced off-task behavior and increased the frequency in which  students used manipulative materials and games. By contrast, it  has been hypothesized that colorful room designs may increase  distractibility and off-task behavior, at least for younger learners  [16, 26]. Additionally, Barret et al. [3] reported that several  classroom design parameters were significantly associated with  learning outcomes in elementary school students. Importantly, the  authors initially hypothesized that the features color and  complexity would be positively related to student learning, but  instead found that these features were negatively related to  students learning outcomes.   However, much of this work has considered visual design  attributes in isolation, identifying positive and negative correlates  to learning [25] of specific visual design choices. By contrast,  there is relatively little literature that considers that specific visual  elements may form a systematic design chosen by teachers. In  addition, much of prior work has solely considered the visual  aspects of what teachers place on walls, as opposed to the  semantic content of what is placed on walls.  Better understanding teachers systematic design choices for walls  may be useful towards understanding which designs are more  pedagogically useful, and whether some designs are distracting.  For example, using walls as a posting place for instructional  materials may be distracting to students, causing off-task behavior  [6], carelessness [7], or other forms of disengagement.  Considerable research has suggested that disengaged behaviors of   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies  are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

While  teachers play a dominant role in influencing students attention,  the amount of time in which students actively attend to  instructional activities is limited; this makes students more  susceptible to distractions within their immediate surroundings  [23]. Identifying the sources of these disengaged behaviors can  help teachers understand what interventions can improve  students patterns of motivation and engagement [10]. Within the  classroom setting, walls have also been used to regulate student  behaviors and attention [cf. 27], displaying classroom rules and  charts about which students are following classroom rules [24].   By considering teachers design choices for walls more  systematically, we may be able to see which overall choices have  positive impacts, and eventually may be able to create wall design  patterns that best promote engagement and learning. Over the  years, educational design patterns have been integrated into  several domains of learning technology, including the  development of computer science courses [4], web-based  instruction [15] and e-learning [11]. These design patterns can in  turn be used in discovery with models analyses [18] to discover  which design patterns are associated with better learning  outcomes and less disengagement. A list of positive design  features is likely to be less useful than a set of design patterns,  since there are several ways to combine the individual  components teachers use in classroom wall design.   One method for understanding systematic choices, that is, which  smaller-scale choices fit together, is to use clustering [20]. A  cluster algorithm can give insight into which individual elements  frequently co-occur, as part of overall patterns. Recent work in  educational data mining has attempted to achieve similar goals  toward the discovery of meaningful patterns in educational data.  Amershi and Conati [1] applied an unsupervised clustering  algorithm to determine which student interaction patterns  distinguished high or low learning; they were able to move from  relatively low-level student actions to understandable and usable  patterns. Similarly, Fouts and Myers [14] made use of clustering  to analyze various types of classroom environments during  science instruction. In specific, classrooms with high levels of  student involvement, teacher support, group affiliation, order and  organization, and teacher innovation were associated with better  attitudes toward science [14]. These studies highlight the value of  using an exploratory approach to study the combination of distinct  features within different learning environments.   In this study, we use clustering analysis to investigate features of  classroom wall design. This analysis adds to the existing literature  on classroom visual and physical design, by studying which wall  design elements go together, and whether there are clusters where  the same type of wall element can be part of very different wall  use strategies.  Within this paper, we research this question using data from 30  elementary school classrooms in the Northeastern United States.  Classrooms were photographed after school, systematically coded  by designers, and analyzed using k-means clustering. Through  this method, we will study the groupings in classroom wall  design.    2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 Data Collection  30 classrooms from local charter, private, and religious schools in  the Northeastern United States were recruited for the present   study. The following was the distribution of the different schools:  14 charter classrooms, 13 private classrooms, and 3 religious  classrooms. Within these schools, the sample included 7  kindergarten classrooms, 7 first-grade classrooms, 7 second-grade  classrooms, 3 third-grade classrooms, and 6 fourth-grade  classrooms. Photographs of classroom walls were taken during the  fall semester (October-December 2012).     2.2 Coding Scheme  To understand the types of flat materials placed on the classroom  walls, we coded for content, using a coding system developed for  this purpose, the Classroom Wall Coding System, CWaCS 1.0.  For each classroom wall photographed, units of analysis were  identified with a box in the qualitative analysis software program  Hyper-RESEARCH v3.5.2 [19]. All units in the walls were then  coded in terms of three categories: academic, non-academic, and  behavior. Academic items are relevant for student learning and  were sub-classified into two sub-categories: academic  organizational and academic topics. Academic organizational  items regard the organization of class activities and were sub- classified into eight sub-categories: goals for the day, group  assignments, job charts, labels, schedule day/week, yearly  schedule, skills, and homework. Academic topics pertain to  specific content learning materials and were further classified into  five sub-categories: content specific, procedures, resources,  calendars/clocks, and other. Non-academic items provide general  information such as school policy, teacher information, and  decorative items. Non-academic items were sub-classified into  five categories: motivational slogans, decorations, decorative  frames, student art, and other non-academic. Behavior materials  aim to influence student behavior (e.g., good behavior charts,  book challenge points). Behavior was subdivided into four sub- categories: behavior management, progress charts, rules, and  other behavior. Two trained coders coded approximately half of  the 30 classrooms each. Both trained coders then coded the same  four classrooms (13%); interrater agreement was very good  (Cohens kappa = .91). Approximately half of the wall displays  (51%) were related to academic content; the other 49% involved  other categories.   2.3 Analytical Method   Given the hierarchical coding scheme, and its application to the  data, we computed the frequency of each type of visual design  feature observed within the four walls of each classroom. We  focused on the upper level of aggregation, given the relative  sparcity of the sub-categories across the relatively small sample of  classes.  We then applied clustering to the resultant data set. Clustering is  defined as the process of grouping a set of objects, such that those  belonging to the same cluster share similarities in their feature  vectors [29].   K-means, the most straightforward and popular clustering  algorithm, was used in the present paper because of its fast and  easy implementation and interpretation. The k-means method  produces k clusters. It first involves the formation of k initial  clusters, typically (and in this case) placed randomly. Given this  initial clustering, member points are allocated according to the  nearest centroids. Once points are allocated, cluster centroids are  reassigned. This process of recalculating and updating the  centroids is repeated until the convergence criteria are met [29].    45    In this paper, since the number of clusters was not prescribed in  advance, different possibilities were randomly applied beginning  with a given minimum of k=1. The results are discussed below.   The next step was to determine what distinguishes classrooms in  terms of visual design features, by studying which variables  characterize each clusters differences from the other clusters. In  order to study this, the means plus and minus one standard  deviation were computed for all attributes within each cluster.  Calculations from both these equations were then compared  against the corresponding overall averages of each type of visual  feature. Significant differences between these values revealed  which visual features each of the resultant clusters were  particularly extreme on.   Clusters were then analyzed based on the distribution of the  different schools (e.g. charter, private, and religious). In  particular, we used the Monte Carlo method to investigate  whether patterns of teachers design decisions were associated  with a particular kind of school.    3. RESULTS   As previously mentioned, we systematically tried different  numbers of clusters within the k-means algorithm.  After 4  clusters, new clusters primarily represented outliers. We found  that k=4 clustering had one singleton (outlier) cluster (already  seen with 2 clusters); the k=5 clustering was identical, except  there was an additional cluster with two outlier data points;  further addition of clusters provided more outlier clusters. Since  outlier clusters do not provide information on cross-class trends,  we selected the clustering analysis for k=4 for further analysis.  The resultant clusters varied somewhat in size: cluster 1 (n=6),  cluster 2 (n=15), cluster 3 (n=8), and cluster 4 (n=1).   In order to identify visual features that distinguished between the  clusters, the means and standard deviations of clusters were  compared against the overall averages of each visual feature.  Table 1 summarizes a list of distinct visual features for each  cluster. Plus and minus signs correspond to high and low values.    There were observable differences between the feature averages  in different clusters. Classrooms grouped in cluster 1 had walls  with considerable numbers of labels and non-academic content,  particularly in the form of decorations. This cluster represented  classroom walls covered with organizational and decorative  content. Cluster 1 was the only group that had average levels of  content-related decorations, whereas the rest of the clusters were  significantly above or below the mean for this feature. As shown  in the high cluster averages and standard deviations, classrooms  included in Cluster 3 were particularly high in terms of academic,  content, decorations, and student art. Cluster 3 reflected walls that  were covered in content-specific and decorative materials.  Conversely, classrooms belonging to Cluster 2 had walls that   were relatively low in academic content, labels, and decorations.  Cluster 2 was also extreme on the content-specific feature, but in  the opposite direction, having classroom walls with relatively  little content-specific content. Classroom walls in cluster 2  classrooms were also low on academic and decorative content.  The singleton Cluster 4 had walls with substantial amounts of  other nonacademic, procedural, and content-specific materials.   Relative to other groups, this cluster represented classroom walls  that were considerably distinct on other nonacademic wall  material, content-specific content, and procedures. Interestingly,  every cluster had at least some wall displays related to classroom  behavior; there was no cluster where this design choice was rare.  In summary, the amount of content-specific and decorative  materials distinguished most of the classrooms. Figure 1  illustrates the differences among clusters in terms of these  features. From this scatterplot, we can see that the classrooms in  Cluster 2 showed relatively low amounts of content-specific and  decorative displays compared to the rest of the other clusters.  Cluster 1 generally had more decorations and content-specific  displays. Cluster 3 had relatively more content-specific content  and less decorations than other classrooms (except for one outlier  within this cluster). Cluster 4 (outlier) was relatively similar to  Cluster 3 in terms of these variables (but differed strongly in  terms of other non-academic content).      3.1 Clusters and Type of School  One additional research question that was asked of this data is  whether the clusters were related to the type of school. In other  words, are some design decisions driven by the fact that the  school is a charter school, a private school, or a religious school    In investigating this, we determined that 5 out of the 6 charter  schools were in Cluster 1, and that 10 out of the 15 private  schools were in Cluster 2. However, it was not clear whether  these proportions were due to chance, and there is not a  straightforward statistical test for answering this question. An  alternative approach is to run a Monte Carlo analysis [17] where  we assume chance distribution of classrooms to clusters (based  solely on the clusters size), and see how often these proportions  are obtained. Hence, in our Monte Carlo analysis, we assumed  that classrooms were randomly assigned to clusters in the  following proportions: Cluster 1 (6/30), Cluster 2 (15/30), Cluster  3 (8/30), and Cluster 4 (1/30), regardless of private, charter or  religious status.     We assigned clusters in this fashion 10,000 times. Based on the  Monte Carlo analysis, we found that the probability that 5 out 6  charter schools would be grouped in Cluster 1 based solely on  their proportion in the data set was 0.0405 (i.e. p=0.0405). The  probability that 10 out of 15 private schools would be grouped in   Table 1: Distinguishing visual features for k=4  Feature Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 Cluster 4  Content specific  - + +  Decorations + - +    Labels + -    Other   nonacademic  +   +   Procedures    +  Student art   +        Figure 1: Feature comparisons among clusters   46    Cluster 2 based solely on their proportion in the data set was  0.0131 (i.e. p=0.0131). In both cases, then, random chance would  result in the effect seen less than 5% of the time. This result  indicates that charter schools were disproportionately represented  in Cluster 1 and private schools were disproportionately  represented in Cluster 2. As such, something in the school culture  and practices of charter schools in this region results in  significantly greater amounts of wall decorations than other types  of schools. By contrast, some aspect of the school culture or  practices of private schools in this region results in low numbers  of wall displays.    4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  The present study forms a first step in investigating visual  classroom design using a clustering algorithm. While it is  common practice for teachers to consider and discuss what to  place on the walls of their classrooms, this is rarely an emphasis  in educational research [12]. As such, the implications of this  study provide a first empirical look at how teachers systematically  design the visual classroom environment.   Our findings indicate that one big difference between classrooms  was whether teachers chose to focus their walls on content- specific topics, which combined with other design decisions in  interesting ways. For instance, as mentioned earlier, walls in the  singleton Cluster 4 were predominantly covered with content- specific, procedural, and non-academic materials. The teacher  from this cluster likely made use of visual displays for guiding  student learning, focusing on academic topics and procedures. He  or she also utilized the wall space for posting general information  and teacher-related content. This combination of features may  represent a type of teacher who seems to view visual displays as a  means of recalling or referring to information that is particularly  intended for students or educators.   Similar to this, Cluster 3 was also particularly high on content- specific wall displays. In addition to exhibiting content-specific  topics, a significantly high amount of decorations was observed  within this set of classrooms; this was the only group that had  substantial amounts of student artwork displays. In a national  survey of instructional strategies, Burton [5] found that some  teachers post artworks to engage and motivate their students.  Similarly, teachers from this cluster may regard decorative  materials as motivational tools for learning. However, walls rich  in class work and academic displays do not necessarily indicate  better use of wall space. Considerable amounts of wall displays  can potentially appear cluttered and disorganized, making it more  difficult for students to recognize and find pertinent information  [2]. In addition, content-specific material may not be useful in  many situations, such as mathematics content during a language  arts lesson.  The integration of high academic and decorative material seen in  these clusters is a stark contrast to the classrooms belonging to  Cluster 2. This group of classrooms had the opposite pattern from  Cluster 3, with low amounts of both academic and nonacademic  wall displays. This reflects a set of teachers  many of them  private school teachers  who rarely use academic displays,  labels, or decorations in designing a classroom. Teachers who  refrain from displaying various types of decorative materials may  consider wall decorations to be distractors from learning. It has  also been hypothesized that teacher effectiveness may be higher  when teachers dont need to compete with visually stimulating  wall displays for student attention [2, 26]. Consistent with these  hypotheses, Godwin and Fisher [16] found significantly higher   proportions of student off-task behavior in learning settings  furnished with high amounts of visual materials, as compared to  learning settings with few sources of visual distraction. Further  studies need to be conducted to understand the link between  specific types of classroom decorations and attention, as well as  the motivations behind the infrequent use of specific visual  features by these teachers.   The last cluster, Cluster 1, includes classrooms where walls were  covered with organizational and nonacademic information, rather  than content-specific. Given the substantial amount of labels,  decorations, and teacher-related content, classrooms in this cluster  represent print-rich environments. Since labels were used to  describe materials and areas in the classroom, this set of teachers,  primarily charter school teachers, likely made use of print  displays to help students navigate their way around the classroom.   Features from the behavior category were also not found to be  significant in distinguishing between clusters. Behavior-specific  features were common across all clusters and types of schools.   Considering these clustering findings, the importance of the  content-specific feature suggests that educators have different  approaches in displaying academic content with other decorative  materials. The clusters found also indicate that the display  features can interact in different ways. As shown in Clusters 1 and  2, the preference for posting decorations and labels seems to be  associated with each other.   The degree to which teachers post organizational and decorative  content is possibly related to a certain type of school. This may  relate more broadly to some of the goals adopted at these schools,  as well as more general school culture and practices. For example,  at the Charter schools studied, considerable emphasis is placed on  literacy development; students have 2.5 hours of reading and  writing each day. This may explain why these schools are more  likely to encourage print-rich environments, where students are  immersed in colorful decorations and functional text. This could  also explain why considerable amounts of decorations and labels  were observed in this cluster that was substantially comprised of  charter schools. In contrast, the relatively visually sparse  classrooms represented in Cluster 2 predominantly came from  private schools. This suggests that private school teachers in this  region may consider visual displays distracting. However, these  hypotheses are clearly speculative at this point, and further  research is necessary to explore these possibilities. In particular, it  may be valuable to interview teachers about their classroom  display choices in order to understand these choices better.  Nevertheless, the type of school appears to be another relevant  factor in determining specific patterns in teachers design  decisions.   Overall, the reported findings suggest that there is systematicity in  how teachers from varying schools choose to decorate their  classroom walls. While a number of previous studies note the  importance of classroom design on learning, much of this prior  research discusses design factors as individual components. To  the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to report  clustering outcomes on the systematic patterns teachers use to  design classroom walls. In a classroom setting where  environmental features are all interrelated [3], understanding a set  of design patterns is more pedagogically useful than investigating  features in isolation.   Given that the sample studied here was drawn from a single  region, future broader-scale research is necessary to be able to   47    generalize these results to a wider population of schools and  educators. Beyond this, it may be worthwhile to further examine  why private and charter schoolteachers differ in choices of wall  design, perhaps integrating interviews to better understand these  choices. Another interesting area for future work might be to  explore clustering from the wall level and determine if there are  any significant differences in the content between the main (e.g.  whiteboard and blackboard) and supporting walls. Prior work has  indicated that wall organization strategies, wherein main and  supporting walls are clearly defined, show considerably higher  percentages of skill acquisition in academic tasks [10].   Perhaps, the most important area of future work is to study the  impact of visual design choices on other variables of interest.  Different schools in the region studied make distinct choices  about how to use classroom walls; what are the effects of these  choices There are significant differences in between classrooms  and across classes studied - nearly half of the wall displays is  unrelated to academic topics. It may be valuable to examine how  the visual content and organization of classroom walls influence  student performance. Studying how classroom design choices  influence childrens engagement and learning outcomes will help  us to understand the impacts of these design choices, and to move  towards an era when classroom visual design is engineered based  on data rather than intuition.   5.

INTRODUCTION  Learning analytics is widely seen as entailing a feedback loop,  where actionable intelligence [7] is produced from data about  leaners and their contexts, and interventions are made with the  aim of improving learning ([5, 8, 9, 12, 15]). This is at the heart of  the Learning Analytics Cycle set out by Clow [10], which is  intended to make the necessity of closing the feedback loop  through appropriate interventions unmistakable. How is the loop  to be closed Actionable intelligence needs to be coupled to   intelligent action.  Sophisticated educational data mining tools are often hard for  non-specialists to use and interpret [19], so previous learning  analytics literature (see e.g. [16, 17, 2022]) has highlighted the  need for multidisciplinary teams, with a key role played by  humans in interpreting the data, engaging in sense-making  activities to mediate the information in ways that enable  intelligent action. As Siemens [22] puts it, sense-making and  social processes are important because of the complexity of the  data and because learning is a complex social activity.   How should such human sense-making efforts be implemented  To be effective beyond small-scale exploratory activity,  programmes will be institution-wide efforts [4], with careful  consideration given to how they will interact with educational  systems, leaders and other stakeholders [20]. In particular,  academic staff/faculty and researchers need to be supported to  learn to interpret and design learning analytics [6], through the  establishment of a contextual framework [14] and developing a  culture of data use as part of increasing organisational capacity  [16]. This is not a straightforward process: some academic staff  may be resistant to what they perceive as the metrics agenda.  However, engaging with learning analytics can steer the agenda  towards richer conceptions of learning than a nave quantitative  view might imply [9].   To achieve sustainable transformation, it is important to support a  Community of Practice [13, 23] around the use of learning  analytics. Argyris and Schn [1] developed and popularised the  conception of single- and double-loop learning as important  factors in organisational learning. In a learning analytics context  [10]:   A learning analytics system may be used simply to attempt to  achieve set goals (single-loop learning); greater value and insight  will come if those goals themselves can be interrogated,  challenged, and developed (double-loop learning).  Despite this concern for institution-wide capacity-building  learning analytics programmes, there are  so far  few accounts  of such activity in the learning analytics literature. (With some  notable exceptions, such as Signals at Purdue [2, 3] and  Macfadyen & Dawson [17].)  This paper describes such a programme of activity, where a group  of Data Wranglers were deployed to engage in sense-making  activity with learning analytics data. The immediate goal was  producing reports with actionable recommendations, and the  overall aim was to drive systematic improvement through single-  and double-loop learning, and through the support and  development of a Community of Practice at the Open University  UK (OU). This included engagement with a range of stakeholders  from individual academic staff to senior managers. (For a very  brief early outline of earlier work on this project, see [18].)

CONTEXT AND ROLE OF DATA  WRANGLERS  The OU is a large distance teaching/online university, with around  250,000 students studying largely part-time, with much (but not  all) of the tuition online. So the quantity of electronic data is  considerable. Managing the scale of the student body requires  considerable centralisation and many administrative systems and  processes. This could create a gap in knowledge and practice  between the data about learning and the academics who need to be  in a position to act in order to improve teaching provision: a gap  that could easily widen as the quantity and complexity of data  increases.   To address this problem  to ensure that the data being collected  was interpreted and turned in to actionable insight  pilot work  started in 2010 and was expanded and developed into the Data  Wranglers project from 2012.    The Data Wranglers are a group of academics who analyse data  about student learning and prepare reports with actionable  recommendations based on that data. There is a Data Wrangler for  each of the OUs seven academic Faculties, and so far as possible  the Data Wranglers are selected to have an academic background  close to the Faculty they are working with.1   Their role is to translate the theory described above in to practice:  to act as human sense-makers, facilitating action on feedback  from learners, making better sense of what that feedback means  and how the data can be improved (double-loop learning), and  helping to develop the Community of Practice around the use of  learning analytics.   The Data Wranglers work with four main data sources:     Survey feedback data from students, gathered at the end  of their course.     Activity data from the VLE/LMS (Moodle).    Delivery data about the mode of delivery and structure   of courses (e.g. what use each course makes of online  forums).     Aggregated completion, pass rate and demographic  data.   In practical terms, data from these sources is aggregated using a  SAS data warehouse, and exported to a Tableau workbook for  each Faculty. The Data Wranglers use these workbooks as their  primary data investigation tool, and to generate some charts and  visualisations, but also use the data sources directly (including  SAS portals on the Data Warehouse) where appropriate, and  produce their own charts in Excel.   To help make sense of the data, the Data Wranglers develop an  understanding of the particular situation of the Faculty they are  working with, building up relationships with key stakeholders to  enable the reports to focus on areas where they can be of most  value. The Data Wranglers also seek opportunities to engage with  Faculty academics to support the use of this data in action,  including work on individual courses and sitting on relevant  committees.   The reports form the basis of an ongoing conversation with the  Faculty about feedback on the learning experience. Further  analysis is carried out where this is required, ranging from a  simple extra table of data to a full-scale institutional research                                                                    1 The author of this paper is one of these Data Wranglers.   project, as resources permit. The Data Wranglers also support the  delivery of Learning Design [11] activities. There is strong  potential synergy between learning analytics and Learning  Design. As Lockyer, Heathcote & Dawson argue [14],  Learning  Design can provide an account of pedagogical intent that can  provide useful context for interpreting learning analytics, and  learning analytics can provide particularly useful insight to  underpin the process of Learning Design. So, for instance, some  Data Wranglers were able to attend or even facilitate Learning  Design workshops, to help the process of closing the feedback  loop.   It is important to note that all the data are available to academics  directly, via various dashboards and online facilities. The role of  the Data Wrangler is not only to analyse the data, but to increase  the familiarity of academics with the data sources, to build  learning analytics capacity as part of a Community of Practice.   To illustrate this graphically, Figure 1 shows the situation before  the Data Wranglers were in place: some users made some use of  the data, but not extensively. In Figure 2, the Data Wrangler  makes use of all data sources, and makes this available to all the  users. As a result of the process, more users become familiar with  the data sources, and begin to make more use of them directly, as  depicted in Figure 3.     Figure 1. Situation before Data Wrangler in place: users make   little use of available data sources     Figure 2. Situation when Data Wrangler starts work: Data   Wrangler presents data from all sources to all users.     Figure 3. Situation when Data Wrangler work is mature:   many users make more use of data sources directly.  The Data Wrangler activity is one component of a large, complex  system of quality assurance and quality enhancement. Notably,   50    there are other processes for formal feedback and action on  student feedback, completion, and pass rate data. Predictive  analytics are also under development, but are not yet widely  deployed.   3. EXAMPLES  Four Data Wrangling reports, of around 20-30 pages each, have  been produced for each of the OUs seven Faculties2, at roughly  four-monthly intervals over the period from Spring 2012 to  Summer 2013. To illustrate the role of the Data Wranglers, this  section presents examples of analyses from Data Wrangler reports  that resulted in changed capacity to act on learning analytics data.   The first example is usage data from the VLE/LMS. Figure 4  shows the use of various VLE/LMS components by week for one  particular course. There are two troughs in overall activity, visible  in the drops in Pages and Forum visits in weeks 5-8 and 11-12,  which through conversation with the course team correspond to  the pattern of online activity designed in to the course. Even more  striking are the steep peaks for Quiz use in weeks 4, 9 and 13,  which (perhaps unsurprisingly) the weeks where students are  directed to complete Quizzes as part of their assessment.      Figure 4. Unique visits to pages, forum and wiki by week for   one specific course.  This provided benefit at two levels. At a high level, it gave a  degree of ground-truthing to support the development of proactive  student support system based on predictive modelling (still in  development). At a lower level, charts such as Figure 4 drew the  availability of this data to the attention of an academic who had  concerns about a new cohort of students, and the Data Wrangler  was able to quickly capture and present similar charts to enable  them to understand the change and take appropriate action.   Other examples provided contextually-relevant data to support  longstanding good practice in online learning. Two such examples  are discussed below.   The first such piece of good practice concerns the importance of  assessment: it is well known that students tend to ignore optional  learning activities but are likely to focus on activities that are  assessed. This was evident in data presented in a Data Wrangler                                                                     2 There are some missing reports for some Faculties due to   staffing issues.   report. As shown in Table 1, on courses that make only incidental  use of Elluminate (synchronous conferencing), few students make  use of it. Where the course specifies an activity, about half of  students used it, but almost all (95%) students used it where the  activity were referenced in the assessment. This data was in  theory available to academics before the Data Wrangler process,  and it is hardly a groundbreaking research finding, but it did add  highly relevant weight to discussions about course design and the  role of assessment.   Table 1. Usage of Elluminate broken down by course use of  Elluminate for one Faculty between 2011-2012.   Course use of Elluminate Students using  Elluminate   None 18%   Informal 27%   General student support 35%   Specified activities not assessed 49%   Specified activities referenced in assessment 95%     The second good practice example comes from students reported  enjoyment of different learning activities. Figure 5 shows that  many students enjoy learning through reading print, but far fewer  enjoy learning through reading text online; listening to audio is a  little more popular and viewing AV is almost as popular as print.  However, Figure 6 shows that activities change this balance:  about as many students report enjoying learning through online  activities as through in-text activities, with ratings higher than for  AV activities or tutor activities, and almost as high as for reading  print. Again, these results provided extra, locally-valid empirical  grounding for the mainstream instructional design advice: when  teaching online, use less text and more activities. Charts like these  were presented as part of a learning design workshop, which  facilitated a very productive, detailed discussion about the nature  of online learning, and helped move the focus of debate away  from the subject being taught (a common preoccupation of early  career teachers) and towards how it can best be learned by  students.       Figure 5. Proportion of students on selected courses who   report that they enjoy learning through different media.  One key finding from the work was a largely null one: despite  considerable analytical effort, surprisingly few significant  correlations could be found at the macro level between student  feedback, related aspects of course design recorded in the delivery  data, and VLE/LMS activity data. It may be that the data was too  coarse to show effects, or that the delivery data was not accurate.   51      Figure 6. Proportion of students on selected courses who   report that they enjoy learning through different activities.  One final example illustrates the Data Wrangler process at its  best. Some issues with a suite of courses emerged in one Faculty.  The senior manager responsible had already engaged with their  Data Wrangler through several reports, and so was able to ask for  a quick bespoke report on those particular courses. The senior  manager reported that this had been very helpful in the review of  those courses, enabling the decisions to be made on the best  available data.   4. EVALUATION   The aim of the Data Wranglers is to improve the learning  experience. Disappointingly, the overall performance indicators  that directly relate to this (e.g. student retention, completion,  progression and feedback) have if anything worsened slightly  since the project was started. However, this seems most likely to  be the result of a substantial change in funding regime that took  place over the same time period: the majority of student fees were  previously paid via public funding, but are now paid by the  student via Government-backed loans. As well as changing the  profile of new students (in ways that were predicted to lead to  worse outcomes), this has also required substantial changes to OU  structures, systems and processes that have yet to bed in. Also, the  expected timescale for an improvement is long. Course production  is the main target for Data Wrangling, and OU courses, despite  recent acceleration, take 1-3 years to produce, and thereafter are  generally presented with only minor modifications for several  years.    Encouragingly, there is good anecdotal evidence of increasing  direct use of the data sources by Faculty members, although log  data to support this is not available. There was also evidence in  the reports of issues being raised through the reports leading to  further investigation and action being taken.   An evaluation of the Data Wranglers work was carried out and  reported internally in July 2013. Feedback was obtained from  most of the direct recipients of the reports in the faculties, and  from other stakeholders (total N=22), by email or through face-to- face discussion if that was preferred. Feedback was also obtained  from the Data Wranglers and the statisticians supporting their  work.   Feedback from stakeholders was generally positive, with  respondents reporting that they valued the process, and its  iterative, conversational nature in particular:    [U]seful to have an iterative phase during which queried  Wranglers interpretation   The reports have stimulated productive reflection and discussion,  with many stakeholders reporting instances where the reports have  triggered or supported discussions about the development of  teaching, e.g.:   Main use of the reports has been in stimulating discussion  around ways in which we can improve the students learning,  particularly online.  Useful in supporting [course] review and curriculum planning  discussions.  Another theme was a desire for more data to be included in the  reports: more data sources, more fine-grained data, more historical  data for comparison, and more data related to the new OU  structures, systems and processes.    A less positive theme was the unevenness of the process across  Faculties. The reports were all produced to the same template, and  based on the same data sources, but the analysis and  recommendations varied, as did the quality of the conversation  between the Data Wrangler and Faculty members. Other concerns  raised included the timing of the reports and which courses were  included.   Perhaps the largest issue was data quality. One serious  misinterpretation of VLE/LMS activity data arose during the  project, and the quality and resolution of the delivery data was  perceived as a serious obstacle. Until the Data Wranglers started  work, this data was rarely used. It was only through engaging with  this data and attempting to deploy it that the quality issues came to  light. This ongoing conversation about data  between those who  capture and curate it and those who can do something about it  is  key to the double-loop learning aspect of the process.   This evaluation is being used to inform future Data Wrangler  activity. Further reports are in progress, with improvements to the  process based on the evaluation and to address stakeholder  concerns. The Data Wrangler work is embedded in institutional  processes, with engagement at the most senior level as well as  with individual academics.   5. CONCLUSIONS  This paper has presented an account of Data Wranglers.  Substantial progress has been made in establishing a Community  of Practice in learning analytics, by analysing and presenting  learning analytics data to academics who are in a position to take  action, and through extensive engagement.  Progress has also been  made in improving institutional learning about the quality and  interpretation of the available data, and how better data can be  captured and made available.   A structurally similar project  large scale and with senior  management engagement  is discussed Macfadyen & Dawsons  analysis of LMS use at a large research-intensive university [17].  In that project, technical discussions swamped more meaningful  change processes. In contrast, the Data Wrangler work detailed in  this current paper was perhaps better placed to present data to  those involved in strategic institutional planning in ways that have  the power to motivate organizational adoption and cultural  change. The analysts were well embedded within the  organisation to begin with, and they were able to facilitate  conversations about pedagogical issues through finer-grained  analyses. This project was able to pay greater attention [] to  the accessibility and presentation of analytics processes and  findings so that learning analytics discoveries also have the   52    capacity to surprise and compel, and thus motivate behavioural  change  although it is not yet a runaway success.   This approach is high cost in terms of time. The high cost has  been matched by a high yield in understanding, which enabled  further development. There is now an institution-wide top-down  analytics strategy in place, and this is built on a bottom-up  understanding of at least some of the potential of the data to  improve learning.   The Data Wrangler process is not uniform. It capitalises on the  individual strengths of the Data Wranglers and the key  stakeholders in the Faculties. This is as expected in a capacity- building exercise: the process must start from peoples existing  expertise, and if capacity building is required, this expertise will  of necessity be lacking.   The issues of data quality unearthed through the Data Wrangler  process shows the value of sense-making activity. If it is nobodys  job to make sense of the data, the risk is that the data do not make  sense but nobody realises.   A bottom-up, grounded approach is necessary for sense making.  However, as Macfadyen & Dawson [17] powerfully argue,  organisational change is hard to achieve without meaningful  engagement at the strategic, top-down level as well. The Data  Wrangler process encapsulates this: the richest discussions were at  an individual course level, but engagement at the levels of  Faculties and the whole institution was also valuable in capacity  building. As previously argued [10], students and teachers are  closest to the learning experience and best placed to take rapid,  appropriate action in the light of learning analytics data, but  managers and policymakers are able to take action at a much  greater scale of impact.   Substantial organisational change is hard. Significant effort and  sensitive engagement is necessary and not always sufficient.  Transformatory change is likely to take substantial amounts of  time. The process can appear messy, and it is easy to focus on  disappointments. However, it is only through the detailed process  of engagement and dialogue between analysts, stakeholders and  the data that insight and organisational change are developed.   6.

INTRODUCTION  Assessments are necessary for tutoring systems that try to make  informed and effective interventions.  It follows that monitoring  comprehension is vital for computerized tutors that teach reading  skills.  For the scope of this paper, we define comprehension as  understanding the meaning of a sentence in the context of a story.   Understanding could be hurt by failures in parsing the sentence  (syntax), understanding the meaning of the words and phrases  (semantics), and understanding how the sentence fits into the  larger context of the story (inter-sentential understanding).   Many traditional systems assess students using comprehension  questions.  Though comprehension questions have strong face  validity, they can take time to produce by hand.  While  computational methods exist to generate these questions, they are  imperfect [1].  And though they have shown significant  correlation with standardized comprehension tests [2], there  remains room for improvement.   Recent work has shown promising first results for the feasibility  of using low-cost EEG to generate above-chance predictions of  reading difficulty [3].  Ideally, replacing comprehension questions  with passive assessment through EEG could (1) save material  developers the trouble of creating questions, (2) save students the  time to answer the questions, and (3) monitor the various  components of understanding (e.g. semantic, syntactic) necessary  to more fully diagnose lapses in comprehension.   We hypothesize that through the use of machine learning  techniques, we can create an above-chance detector of lapses in  reading comprehension.  Additionally, we try to create a classifier  for distinguishing student mental states as they evaluate 3 types of  possible violations (syntactic, semantic, or contextual).   1.1 Related Work  Previous work on methods of unobtrusive reading assessment has  shown that fluency measures (e.g. number of words read per  second) can produce above-chance predictions of fluctuations in  reading comprehension [4].  We hope that EEG can provide  additional information about reading comprehension which may  be used in conjunction with other unobtrusive measures to boost  prediction accuracy.   Much of past work combining EEG and reading comprehension  focuses on understanding mechanisms of comprehension [5][6]  and not the practical use of EEG as a reading assessment tool.   Notably, these experiments use costly EEG devices that are  beyond what would be cost-effective in schools.   Studies using low-cost EEG have so far been unable to reliably  predict reading comprehension [3].  In the present paper, we  expand upon earlier work with low-cost EEG by taking a more  principled approach to question design (Section 2.2) and using  more sophisticated methods of classification (Section 2.4).   1.2 Overview  We report on two experiments.  Our first experiment attempts to  predict student performance on end-of-sentence cloze questions  using EEG signals over the reading passage.  Our second  experiment attempts to detect features of an answer choice (e.g.  ungrammaticality, semantic non-sensicality) using EEG signals  over the short period of time that a student sees that choice.   Section 2 describes our methodology.  Sections 3 and 4 present  respective results of the two experiments.  Section 5 concludes.   2. PROCEDURE  We used a computerized reading tutor (Section 2.1) to present 76  multiple-choice cloze questions generated by 4 lab members  (Section 2.2).  We recorded EEG signals of students who read and  completed those cloze questions.  We use the correctness of the  student responses as our dependent measure of comprehension.

The Reading Tutor is a program that listens to children  read and provides intervention when it catches mistakes.  The  program has demonstrated good performance in many aspects of  reading instruction [2].  Because of its extensive logs and its  support for embedding multiple choice questions within a story, it  is a good platform for our experiment.      2.2 Task  To generate a question, we hand select an appropriate sentence  and remove the last word.  Each question has four choices  one  correct choice and three distracters  as Table 1 illustrates below:   To probe the mental state of the student given their choices, the  three distracters consist of one ungrammatical choice, one  grammatically correct but implausible choice, and one plausible  but incorrect choice.  We hand-wrote these distracters as Table 1  explains.  This design for the distracters is based on previous work  with comprehension questions in the Reading Tutor [1].   After a student reads a truncated sentence, the tutor displays the 4  choices in random order.  The tutor displays one choice at a time  for 1 second each, so that we can tell when students are looking at  each choice type.  This way, we can separate the EEG data for  each answer choice type.  After displaying each choice  individually, the tutor displays them again and the student clicks  on one of the choices.  Students received instructions on the cloze  questions task at the start of each story.   We use multiple-choice cloze questions because they can be  scored by a computer.  In order to reliably select the one correct  answer, the student must isolate the correct answer by recognizing  each of the 3 distracters as incorrect.  Because each distracter is  designed to violate one aspect of understanding (syntax,  semantics, inter-sentential context), ruling them out implies an  understanding of those 3 aspects of meaning of the sentence.   Due to an implementation error, some questions we deployed had  2 implausible choices and no ungrammatical choice.  This error  introduces some additional noise for our answer type classifiers in  section 4.   2.3 EEG Data  We deployed these cloze questions over the course of 7 weeks to  26 2nd-3rd grade students in classrooms at a local urban elementary  school.  In total, the students answered 906 questions.  The  percentages of choices that students selected are as follows:  correct, 13.0% plausible, 6.1% implausible, and 2.2%  ungrammatical.     Figure 1.

Table 1: Example Cloze Question   55    We used NeuroSky BrainBands to record EEG raw waves at 512  Hz.  We used NeuroSkys proprietary algorithms to generate  Signal Quality, Attention, and Meditation scores at 1 Hz.   To denoise, NeuroSkys program removed frequencies below 3Hz  and above 100Hz.  Like Chang et al. [3], we did further denoising  by applying a wavelet transform for soft thresholding [7].  2.4 Classification  For each experiment, we broke down EEG data into segments by  time (2.4.1) and computed features from the segments (2.4.2).   We trained Gaussian Nave Bayes classifiers with these features  and evaluated our classifiers with cross-validation (2.4.4).  Figure  3 illustrates the flow of our experiment.  This pipeline is based on  Chang et al. [3].     Figure 3: Flow of experiment in the form of pseudo-code   2.4.1 Data Segmentation  The students task (reading and answering an end-of-sentence  cloze question) consists of several segments (see Figure 1).   Broadly, there are two overall segments for each question: (1) a  reading portion. containing the sentences that form the context of  the cloze question and the clozed sentence itself and (2) an  answering portion, where the student is reading the 4 answer  choices and selecting an answer.  Figure 1 illustrates this  breakdown.   2.4.2 Features  The NeuroSky program generated 12 data streams1  signal  quality, attention, meditation, rawwave, delta, theta, alpha1,  alpha2, beta1, beta2, gamma1, and gamma2.  We removed any  trials containing EEG signals with imperfect signal quality scores  (for some experiments nearly 50% of data are removed for signal  quality).  We used the 11 channels other than signal quality to  derive features for our classifier.  For each channel, we derived 8  features: mean, variance, min, max, skew, kurtosis, first-order- polynomial-fit, and second-order-polynomial-fit.  Thus each  segment has 88 features in total.   2.4.3 Student-Specific vs. Student-Independent  Classifier  For each experiment, we trained one within-subject classifier  (trained and tested on data from the same subject) and one                                                                    1 Frequencies corresponding to various channels: delta: (1-3Hz);   theta (4-7Hz), alpha1: (8-9Hz); alpha2: (10-12Hz); beta1: (13- 17Hz); beta2: (18-30Hz); gamma1: (31-40Hz); gamma2: (41- 50Hz) [8]   between-subject classifier (tested on one subject, trained on all  other subjects).  The within-subject classifier minimizes the effect  of individual differences by custom training a classifier for each  subject; the between-classifier simulates the performance of the  classifier on unseen subjects.  The between-subject classifier has  the additional advantage of using a much larger training set  (consisting of data from all other subjects) where the within- subject classifier only uses data from a single subject.   2.4.4 Cross-Validation  Our experiments used leave-one-out cross-validation to generate  train/test splits.  For every subject s, we trained the within-subject  classifier on data from subject s and cross-validated on 1 left-out  data point.  We trained the between-subject classifier on data from  all subjects except s and cross-validated on data from s.   2.4.5 Balancing  For most of our experiments, our data is imbalanced.  Because we  want to appraise the accuracy of our classifier without allowing it  to exploit the class size imbalance, we prebalance the data prior to  training.  Like Chang et al [2], we chose to undersample from the  majority class as a conservative way to prebalance.  We lose an  appreciable amount of data (~58%) by undersampling, but we are  still able to get some significant results (Section 3.1.2)   2.4.6 Feature Selection  Due to the high number of features and our relatively small  amount of data, overfitting is a definite concern.  To limit our  features, we used rank feature selection - ranking on class  separability as computed by t-test.  We selected the 3 highest  ranked features as input for our classifier.  We decided on 3 by  trying a variety of cutoffs on a single test subject.  This subject  was not included in any experiments.   2.4.7 Classifier  We trained Gaussian Nave Bayes classifiers using the selected  features.  We chose Nave Bayes because it supports non-linear  decision boundaries (by contrast, we tried linear SVM and it did  not perform as well) and does not require a lot of data to train.  To  avoid building classifiers on too few data points, we only used  subjects with at least 4 samples in each category.   2.4.8 Evaluation  Because we use leave-one-out classification, we produce exactly  two predictions (one between subject and one within subject) for  each data point.  Thus, we have 2 accuracy measures per  experiment  between subject accuracy and within subject  accuracy.   We used two tests for significance.  One is a Chi-Squared test,  comparing the correct-versus-incorrect predictions against a  baseline of 50:50.  The Chi-Squared test is standard for evaluating  the significance of categorical results but it assumes independence  of samples. This assumption is a problem for us because we  measure our predictor multiple times per subject (once per cross- validation fold) and these measurements of the same subject are  not independent of each other.   To deal with these independence assumptions we used Fishers  Method as an additional test of significance.  We treat each  predictors performance on each individual subject as a separate  experiment and perform a Chi-Squared test on each subject.  We  then use Fishers Method to aggregate the test results into a single  significance value.   56    Fishers Method is a meta-analysis technique for aggregating  distinct experiments.  We are aggregating individual subjects from  the same experiment so we are uncertain about how well Fishers  Method applies.  We noticed that Fishers Method gave  significance attributions to several near chance or below chance  results.  We suspect that weve made further violations of  independence assumptions and will explore other significance  tests in future work.  We recommend caution when interpreting  our significance values under Fishers Method.   3. PREDICTING CORRECTNESS  First, we try to predict whether a student will answer a  comprehension question correctly.   3.1 Setup  We want to detect comprehension without using EEG signals  collected during the comprehension question.  To fully factor out  the comprehension question, we need to predict the outcome of  our cloze question using exclusively EEG data over time periods  before the student sees the question (see Experiment R in Figure  1).   Each experiment began with 906 questions but many data  segments were filtered out due to poor EEG signal quality (see N  in Figure 2).  The accuracy shown in Figure 2 is the percentage of  correct predictions on left out data across all subjects.   3.2 Results and Discussion  Our classifier achieves significantly above-chance accuracy (p <  .05) trained on only the reading portion (experiment R).  This  result suggests that the reading portion is informative about  comprehension.  By contrast, the answering portion, without  above-chance accuracy, may not be informative.   Significance remains when we limit the data to 4 seconds, the  minimum length of the answering portion (see R4sec) indicating  that our classifier is not taking advantage of the length of the  reading portion.  Further, our within-class R classifier are has an  above 50% accuracy for both the correct and incorrect labels,  showing that we are not producing degenerate classifiers that only  output the majority class.   The performance of our multi-segmental classifiers (F2, R2) is  comparable to their single-segmental counterparts.  Its possible  that over-fitting due to the increased number of features cancelled  out any benefit those features could have provided.   Notably, most of our significant results are from our between- subjects classifier.  This is understandable since nearly all our  subjects had fewer than 10 incorrect responses so our within- subject classifiers had very little training data.   We warn that our significance test makes more independence  assumptions than warranted (see Section 2.4.8) so significance  should be interpreted with caution.  We also note that we did not  correct for multiple comparisons, although our false discovery  rate (expected number of false positives) is less than one, much  lower than the number of significant results we found.   Though these results suggest that we can detect how well students  understand a sentence, its possible that we are merely  recognizing student preparedness.  Specifically, we would see  similar results if our between-subject classifier was only picking  up on how good of a reader the student is rather than any lapses of  understanding in a specific sentence (good readers tend to answer  correctly more often).  We could check for this hypothesis by  looking at whether our predictions for a given student differ  across stories.  Unfortunately, our current study does not have  large enough N to make this analysis feasible.   4. RECOGNIZING ANSWER TYPES  In addition to correctness, we also tried to detect the students  mental state as he/she read each answer choice.  Each of the 3  distracters in our task represents a different kind of error (see table  1) and should elicit different mental states in students as the  students look at them.  Further, these error-elicited mental states  should be different from the mental state elicited by the correct  choice.  We test whether we could use EEG signals to detect these  differences in mental state.  An above-chance prediction would  suggest that these inexpensive EEG devices could pick up some  underlying mental state related to semantic, syntactic, or  contextual violations.     Figure 2: Accuracy of single segment experiments (note: using Fishers Method produced significant below-chance results)  57    In these experiments, we use 1-second segments representing the  time when a student was reading a particular type of answer  choice (see choice 1 through choice 4 in Figure 1).  We only used  questions where the students gave correct responses, in the hope  that they actually understood the answers.  We produced binary  classifiers for each pair of answer types (e.g. grammatical vs.  correct; plausible vs. implausible).  There were 6 distinctions in  total.   4.1.1 Results and Discussion  The accuracy apparently varies across the different binary  distinctions but because there are no significant above-chance  predictions, we caution against drawing any conclusions from  those apparent differences.   Note that our within-subject plausible vs. ungrammatical accuracy  was significantly below chance.  With  = 0.5, we expect a false  positive rate of 1/20.  Given that there are 12 answer-type  experiments, there is a reasonable (46%) chance of getting at least  one false positive.  This is in contrast to the correctness  experiments where having 4 or more false positives in 16  experiments is highly unlikely (< 0.01% chance).     Table 5: Answer type recognition accuracy (Fischers  significance test not shown)  Experiment Within Between   N Accuracy N Accuracy  Correct vs.  Plausible   402 0.4776 402 0.4776   Correct vs.  Implausible   401 0.4713 401 0.4863   Correct vs.  Ungrammatical   393 0.4529 393 0.5115   Plausible vs.  Implausible   418 0.4569 418 0.5072   Plausible vs.  Ungrammatical   401 0.4090* 401 0.4539   Implausible vs.  Ungrammatical   400 0.4525 400 0.475     The poor results could mean that these specific mental states are  not detectable with EEG but there are a number of alternative  explanations: (1) our specific lower-end EEG devices are not  sensitive enough to detect these states (2) our classification  pipeline does not make good enough use of the data or (3) we  didnt collect enough data to overcome over-fitting/noise issues.   Any combination of those causes could have led to these poor  results.  Future work could explore how to resolve these concerns.   5. CONCLUSION  The present work demonstrates that inexpensive EEG devices can  generate above-chance predictions of comprehension.  Critically,  these predictions only use EEG data recorded before the students  even saw the cloze question.  However, certain independence- assumption violations put the strength of our significance tests in  question.  We also tried to detect student mental states as they saw  various choice types.  Thus far, we are unable to produce a  significant-above-chance classifier of those mental states.   Our system is certainly not ready to replace comprehension  questions.  But these results, though modest, do suggest that some  information about comprehension exists even in inexpensive EEG  devices deployed in noisy classroom settings.  We believe this  work is a necessary first step in evaluating the practical feasibility  of EEG as an unobtrusive measure of reading comprehension.   Future work will explore ways of increasing prediction accuracy,  assessing other dimensions of student knowledge, and applying  those assessments to improve learning outcomes.   6.

INTRODUCTION  Learning Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and  reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of  understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in  which it occurs [1]. While measurement and assessment of  learning is a major goal for learning analytics, it is also a  demanding experience for many teachers. Assessment is not just  important for evaluating learning outcomes: it may also be  motivating for many students who have a performance goal  orientation [2]. Assessment of learning in computer-supported   collaborative learning (CSCL) environments is more than merely  measurement of outcomes; the quality of the collaborative  learning processes [3] is also salient.     While the diverse theoretical and methodological positions in  CSCL are well studied [4, 5, 6], common assessment practices in  CSCL remain largely unexplored [3]. When looking at assessment  methods, teachers need to consider practical issues such as time,  validity, reliability, and individual accountability. Teachers are  under time constraints, so assessment methods should allow them  to evaluate learning and participation in CSCL activities in a  timely manner [2, 7]. Reliability is  an indication of the  consistency of scores across evaluators or over time  [8]. For an  assessment to be reliable, significantly similar results must occur  each time the assessment is performed, regardless of who is  involved in the assessment or when the evaluation occurs.  Validity is how well an assessment actually measures what it is  supposed to measure [8]. In a CSCL context, validity means  whether the measures actually assess learning. Individual  accountability reflects whether the assessment influences  individual performance [9, 10]. Current assessment strategies  employed by teachers in CSCL have difficulty meeting these four  requirements.   After a review of 186 articles and 340 measures incorporated in  CSCL, Gress et al. [11] grouped assessment into seven categories:  self-report, interview, observation, process data, discussions and  dialogues, performance and products, and feedback and/or  prediction. These assessment methods commonly in use today  tend to violate the assessment requirements of time (several of  these are very time intensive), validity, reliability, and individual  accountability in one way or another. For instance, self-reports  (usually in the form of reflections, surveys, or questionnaires)  might be time efficient, but might also be too subjective and affect  the validity and reliability of an assessment [12].      Interview, observation and coding of process-oriented data  (discussions and dialogues) are usually time-intensive and add a  huge burden to the already heavy duties of teachers. Additionally,  due to the lack of a standard metric or published set of  descriptions, these methods may lead to difficulties in determining  the validity of those assessment methods and therefore raises  questions in terms of identifying and defining the quality of  learning and performance [11]. Many constructs, protocols, and  schemes reflect a lack of replication and examination of reliability  across teachers and contexts [11]. Specifically, with discussions,  dialogue or content analysis, most assessment practices do not  directly measure students interactions at face value as  technological manipulation or in relation to knowledge  construction.

On one hand, this way of assessment may  suffer from significant flaws in assessing students learning. Tests  may not be the best indicator of learning. These methods may  overlook the process and context information that students might  gain during the CSCL process; one of the supporting philosophies  in CSCL [2].      On the other hand, grading of group work can be problematic,  both practically and theoretically [2, 11]. Several issues that have  been identified with group grading include: 1) individual  accountability is lost and freeriding often occurs (at the expense of  one or two in the group who do most or all of the work) [13, 14],  2) group grades may tend to over- or underspecify an individual  students competence (equal work may receive different grades  only because of the makeup of a students group, which may be  outside of their control), 3) lower performing students may benefit  more from group grades than their high performing counterparts  [15], and 4) unsatisfactory experiences with group grades may end  up causing students to dislike collaborative learning activities [3].      In daily practice, the most popular assessment method in the  feedback category is peer assessment. In this approach, focus is on  peer ranking (peer work in different areas is ranked on scale), peer  nomination (highest performing members of a group are  nominated), or peer rating (each group member rates all other  members) [7]. Nominations, rankings and ratings have all been  found to result in strong adverse reactions by students [16, 17].  Pond, Ul-Haq and Wade [18] argue that these methods are all  prone to bias, distinguishing four origins for bias: over-marking  (friendship marking), purposive lack of differentiation within  groups (collusive marking), dominant individuals receiving  highest marks (decibel marking) and non-contributing students  benefiting from group marks (parasite marking). Even though  peer assessments save teachers time, the reliability and individual  accountability in these methods may be in doubt.      Assessments of learning in CSCL from process data usually takes  the form of estimated task times, frequency of participation, and  sequencing of events, in addition to trace data [11, 19]. This  method is time efficient, reliable and accounts for each individual.  Unfortunately, many of these assessments end up with mere  participation measures (time on task, messages posted), which  may or may not be good indicators of learning [2]. Therefore,  there may be serious validity issues with these forms of  assessment. Other assessment methods such as navigation path or  social network analysis (content analysis) [20] suffer from some  of the same problems.      Even though Gress [11] identified seven categories of assessment  methods, teachers tend to rely on conventional text-based  measures like self-reports, observations, and content analysis  rather than using automated learning analytics to assess specific  details of learning. Those traditional methods are not only time  consuming but may also suffer from insufficient validity,  reliability, and individual accountability as outlined above.  Something more is needed. The paucity of the use of original  methodologies and research done in this area is not due to  irrelevance or lack of interest: rather, it seems that teachers are  stymied by a lack of proven methodologies and paradigms that  can be applied in a straightforward and holistic way.      However, in an educational research context, there are indicators  that all roads lead back to learning [2]: even though current  assessment methods are not perfect, their measures and  frameworks provide insights for teachers to understand students  learning. As a result, the issue of learning assessment in CSCL  becomes that of building on a proven theoretic paradigm, using  holistic measures (incorporating various indicators and measures  used by previous methods), and providing a time-efficient, valid,  and reliable learning assessment tool to teachers that ensures  individual accountability. Further, Dennen [2] argues that  assessment requires consideration of the learning activity and  medium, as well as the resulting artifacts.      This exploratory study presents a unique application of activity  theory applied to the assessment of CSCL. It is meant to offer a  methodology that can help to fill in the gap of assessment of  student participation in learning activities in CSCL environments,  by assessing student activities holistically and by using cluster  analysis to evaluate strengths and weaknesses in individual  students participation in collaborative activities.     This paper is organized as follows. First, we will provide a  background on activity theory and describe how it is a useful  framework in this context. Next, we will directly apply activity  theory to a CSCL environment, and provide a specific case for  application of this assessment methodology, analyzing and  interpreting holistic participation of individual students in CSCL  activities. Last, we will explicate strengths and weaknesses of  such an approach, and provide directions for future research.     2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  2.1 Activity Theory  Activity theory is a psychological and multidisciplinary theory  that seeks to be naturalistic and offers a holistic framework for  describing activities in practice while linking together individual  and social behavior [21, 22, 23, 24]. A model of the structure of  an activity system was formulated by [22], and includes the  interacting components of subject, object, tools, division of labor,  community, rules, and outcome (see Figure 1).       The activity of learning is the joint activity of a student,  physical/symbolic tool(s), and another person(s) performing  together as a working social system to achieve some outcome  under constraints such as rules [25]. Activity theory focuses on  how participants transform objects and how components in a  system mediate this transformation [22]. Learning is reframed as  social practice (rather than as merely the product of practice) [22,  26]. In our CSCL learning assessment context, the outcome and   Tools  Subject  Rules Community Division of Labor  Object Outcome  Figure 1. Activity Theory   60    process of this transformation are learning and performance. It is  the sum of the system components and the tensions among them  that make up the learning and influence the learning outcomes.  Current common assessment methods only consider part of the  activity of the learning system.   In addition to the interactions of components within an activity  system, a system can have subsystems, which can be separate  (full-fledged) activity systems or other instances of the same  system depending on perspective [23]. Therefore, in order to  highlight the learning outcome of an individual student to  facilitate assessment in individual accountability, the activity  system can be thought of as being built for each student. Thus, the  activity of learning in a CSCL context for every student can be  presented as:          Table 1.

The  five modules we analyzed included teams of three to four  practicing teachers who were learning how to implement the  curriculum in VMTwG while going through the curriculum  themselves. The five modules we analyzed include: a warm up  activity, Messing around with dynamic geometry, Visualizing  the worlds oldest theorems, Constructing triangles and  programming custom tools. The full curriculum currently  includes a total of 18 topics, and is available at the project website  (http://vmt.mathforum.org).    3. METHOD  In this section, we reference activity theory to model individual  student performances in CSCL activities.   3.1 Dataset Description  We collected all the log data for this study in .txt format, which  centers on specific event types from the CSCL environment  (VMT): Awareness, Geogebra, System, Chat, and WhiteBoard  (Wb). The Chat event type logs all the messages that students  communicate with each other. Awareness records the actions of  erasing the chat messages when the student realizes they are full  on the chat bar. Geogebra logs information on how students  visually construct a geometry artifact (e.g. add a point, or update a  segment etc.). The System event type records information on how  the VMT environment is accessed. For example, a student joins a  room, leaves a room or views different tabs created by the  students or teachers. Wb logs actions on how tools are being used  in the white board areas, such as resizing of objects, creating a  textbox, etc.    For every event type, we have logs of what action (adding a point,  sending a chat, erasing a message, or creating a text box, etc.) the  student makes under what subjects/tasks (modules and tasks). In  addition, the environment logs the information about when this  action takes place (time) and how long it lasts (duration) as well  as in which virtual room the event occurs.   3.2 Activity Theory and Behavioral Data  Establishing theoretical coherence between the behavioral data  analyzed and the theoretical lens is a significant concern for socio- technical systems research [27]. As Howison et al note [27], a  good deal of prior research is not explicit regarding this  connection, which has the deleterious effects of drawing findings  into question. In the analysis of group based interaction data, the  Group Informatics ontology and methodological approach  provides researchers with a set of patterns to follow when drawing  connections between behavioral trace data and a particular theory  [28].    In this study we relied on the third authors five years of  participation in the development and analysis of small group  learning in VMTwG to make empirically informed choices about  how to map trace data from the system into an activity theoretic  analysis framework. The exploratory work reported here is a step  forward in the development of instrumentation (learning  analytics) for small group learning systems like VMTwG. We  analyzed our results reflexively in the context of ongoing research  and development in VMTwG.

Activity Theory in CSCL assessment   61    3.3 Dataset Preprocessing  3.3.1 Remove Noise Data  Because various teachers and VMT team members may join the  class from time to time to either facilitate the students learning or  test the environment, our first step is to remove outsiders data.  Next, VMT has different topics and modules. Some tasks or  modules are not related to learning (such as the Focus Group  Interview), and some are topics not covered in the class (such as  Trigonometry). We deleted the log data generated around the  irrelevant modules.   3.3.2 Data Categorization  Since the assessment of learning is more summative in nature, we  did not consider the time dimension. However, our method  enables teachers to assess students learning at any time during the  course to better monitor students participation in CSCL activities.  For the purposes of this study, we only considered the situation at  the end of the training to assess students participation in  collaborative learning activities.     As stated above, assessment should be designed for each student  to meet the individual accountability requirement. Therefore, all  the data are prepared for an individual student. Since the log data  is centered around event types, as well as to facilitate measure  construction in the next section, we process each event into four  dimensions (individual, group, action constraints, and module set)  denoted as below:     E1j =Awareness = {individual, group, action constraints, module  set}  E2j =Chat = {individual, group, action constraints, module set}  E3j =Geogebra = {individual, group, action constraints, module  set}  E4j =System = {individual, group, action constraints, module set}  E5j =Wb = {individual, group, action constraints, module set}  Some modules require personal exploration or experimentation in  the VMT environment and some modules ask the student to  collaborate with others to solve a problem or produce an artifact.  Therefore, the individual category sums all the personal endeavors  or actions (frequency in each event type). Similarly, the group  category sums all the actions the student makes in the group  project (frequency in each event type). The action constraints  dimension sums all the types of action the student performs under  that event type over the whole training. For example, if a student  never erased a message in the Awareness event over all the  modules, then the action constraints for Awareness is 0; for a Wb  event, if a student takes actions such as creating a textbox, or  copying an object, but never uses other actions such as moving  objects, resizing, etc. across the whole class, then the action types  equals 2. Some students may miss one or two modules. Therefore,  the module set dimension records what modules the student is  involved in under each event type. Rather than a single value,  each module set is comprised of the modules in which events take  place. E denotes the event type, Eij the value of every dimension  in every event type, where i denotes the event type i  [1, 5] and j  denotes the dimensions, j  [1, 4] , i  +Z , j  +Z .    Therefore, an event type i can be presented as: iE  = {individual,  group, action constraints, module types} = [ , , , ]i1 i2 i3 i4E E E E    3.4 Measure Construction     Subject: In the CSCL activity of learning (Figure 2), Subject  represents the individual student. When mapped to our log data, it  represents all actions one student makes during the whole training  under the individual modules and tasks, detonated as i1E . In other  words, it is the sum of all actions under individual tasks.  Therefore, for every student n, Subject can be denoted as: Subject   5  n1 1 1  i i  X E =  =  (assuming there are N students in total, n=1, 2, , ).     Rules: As shown in Figure 2, Rules includes implicit and explicit  rules. Under the social-technical construct, the rules are the  implicit rules that constrain students actions, denoted as i3E . In  this VMT context, students have to perform actions that the VMT  environment offers. Therefore, the rules are reflected by the  actions the student uses across all the modules as: Rules  5  2 3 1  n i i  X E =  =  .  Tools: In VMT, Tools are tools that facilitate the learning activity.  Under the VMT context, the tools are the System and Wb where  the students action for tool usage is registered, denoted as i1E and   i2E . Tools  5  3 1 2 4  ( )n i i i  X E E =  = + .    Community: All the communications that help maintain the  community structure. In terms of the VMT context, students use  chat to directly communicate with each other, and use the  awareness function to erase the chat messages, which can be  categorized as an indirect contribution to the community, denoted  as i1E and i2E . Therefore, Community can be presented as the  sum of chat messages and awareness. Community   2  4 1 2 1  ( )n i i i  X E E =  = + .    Division of labor: Division of Labor is the contribution of the  student made to the collaborative learning modules. Even though  chat messages may also contribute to the geometry object  development, the concrete contribution to the geometry object  construction is from the Geogebra dimension. As a result, the  division of labor can be denoted as Division of Labor 5 32nX E= .    Object: The CSCL activity is to achieve the object of a students  active involvement in the whole class. Hence, the first factor to  consider is the number of modules students participate in. In order  to quantify whether the student is active in those learning  modules, we incorporate the totally frequency of participation and  the number of event types. By doing this, we can avoid too high  of ratings for the student who participates in all the modules but  makes very few actions or contributions.     On the other hand, the number of modules the student is involved  in is the key for the object dimension; the other two are secondary  factors. In addition, because the number of modules is in the scale  of 10, while the frequency for participation is in 1000, we use the   function to dampen the effect of the frequency measure. Even  though the event types are in the same scale of modules, we still  want to dial down a little for overall event types that the student  used. Thus, we use a fraction to lower the event type effect for  object measurement, characterized as the event type students are  involved in divided by the overall event types (5). In sum, we  denoted Object as    62    Object  2  6 1 2 14 24 34 44 54 1  log ( )* *( / 5)n i i i i  X E E E E E E E E =  = +        Figure 3. Activity Theory in VMT Assessment   In sum, based on activity theory, we have built a quantified model  for individual student performance in CSCL activities specific to  the VMT environment: [Subject, Rules, Tools, Community,  Division of Labor, Object], as illustrated is Figure 3.       3.5 Assessment of Participation in  Collaborative Learning Activities  3.5.1 Rationale  An activity system is characterized by the internal tensions among  its components. The tensions are the moving force behind  disturbances and innovations and eventually drive the system to  change and develop, in this context toward an outcome of  learning. Therefore, it is hard to compute one value as functions  of the six dimensions to indicate the learning or performance  result of an individual student, especially considering the  complexity of the nature of learning [2, 32]. For example, even  though a specific student contributes much in the Division of  Labor (has a high value in that dimension), we cannot necessarily  assume this student may attain learning from this activity. This student might participate in only one learning module, which  makes him or her deficient in the Object dimension. In other  words, this student does not get exposed to all the knowledge  (various learning modules) but just actively participates in one  particular module.     In this exploratory study, we used K-means cluster analysis to  group students with similar learning results. A K-means cluster  brings into consideration all of the six dimensions in the activity  system rather than accounting for only one dimension. Another  advantage of using cluster analysis is to enable the teacher to  understand the overall collaborative activity performance of the  whole class. It is hard to make any inferences based on an  individual students performance. Clustering can help the teacher  to see the general pattern of students performance levels and  grasp the big picture of how students are participating in  collaborative work in the course.  3.5.2 Procedure  Cluster analysis, which addresses the problem of data  segmentation, belongs to unsupervised learning methods since  there is no knowledge of preferred clusters [29]. It is a set of   techniques used to classify a data set into groups that are  relatively homogeneous within themselves and heterogeneous  between each other on the basis of a defined set of variables [30].  A significant step in clustering is to define the system scale and  select the proper cluster elements, which have been defined in the  last step-measure construction. By considering the measurements  defined in the subsection of measure construction, it is possible to  group the students into different categories with a mathematical  method. Therefore, the state definition used for this study is a  vector of measurements for all the students. The data samples are  therefore multidimensional because the vectors of measure for  each student are considered simultaneously (six dimensions  developed from activity theory). Hence, the system states in our  study are defined as follows, assuming there are 6 representative  measurements in the datasets and there are N students. For  instance, the constructed measure can be recorded for N  individuals (students). Then the data X, a K (6)  K (N) matrix,  will have the format as following.   m  -  11 12 1 15 16  21 22 2m 25 26  n1 n2 nm n5 n6  (N-1)1 (N-1)2 (N-1)m (N 1)5 (N-1)6  N1 N2 Nm N5 N6  x x x x x x x x x x  x x x x x  x x x x x x x x x x             =                                             X  To deal with the differences in scale between different variables  for each student, the cluster elements should be properly  normalized. This process, which uses Eq. (1), is performed prior  to the cluster analysis so as to make the original data  dimensionless.    ' nm m nm  m  x xx s   = ,    (=1,2,, ;   =1,2,, )    (1)   Where, nmx , mx and ms  represent original, average, and the  standard deviation of each variable/measurement, respectively, for  any particular observation.      In cluster analysis, cluster elements are grouped according to their  similarities, or more specifically, the distances between them.  Therefore, the smaller the distances between the elements, the  more similar they are and the more likely they belong to the same  cluster. For our study, squared Euclidean distance, as shown in  Eq. (2), is implemented for calculating the distance between  clusters.   2  1 ( )  M 2 ij im jm  m d x x  =  =  ,   (,=1,2,, ;   =1,2,, )     (2)   Where, 2ijd is the squared Euclidean distance between state   elements  and j; imx  is the thm  element in individual ; and jmx  is  the thm  element in individual j.   The K-means algorithm is one of the most popular techniques in  non-hierarchical clustering, which requires specifying the number  of clusters arbitrarily [31]. Compared to hierarchical clustering,  K-means clustering is a faster and more reliable method,   Tools  Subject  Rules Community Division of Labor  Object Learning  Sum of Participation Frequency (Individual  + Group) over System and Wb Events  Sum of Participation Frequency  (Individual)  over all Events  Sum of Action Constraints  over all Events  Sum of Participation Frequency (Individual  + Group) over Chat and Awareness Events  Participation Frequency (Group)  over Geogebra Event  Function of Module Types,  Event Types and Participation   Frequency (Individual +  Group) over all Events  63    especially for applications with large, high dimensional data sets.  Furthermore, the K-means algorithm repeatedly reassigns  elements to clusters so the same element can move from cluster to  cluster during the analysis. Considering the advantages of non- hierarchical clustering, the proposed methodology for this study is  to select the number of clusters desired (e.g., the teacher can  easily set the cluster number to a desired number for their own  scale). Then the K-means procedure is used to actually form the  clusters.   4. RESULTS     Figure 4. Standardized measurements for Students     For the purposes of analysis, this study used data from 31 users in  the VMT environment. Based on the metrics construction  methodology discussed above, we obtained the metric distribution  shown in Figure 4. This graph shows that each metric is in  fluctuation and that there is no unified trend for the six measures.  For example, for the fifth and sixth students, the sixth one is  higher than the fifth one in the Community value. However, in all  of the other five dimensions such as Subject, Tools, Rules, etc.,  the fifth student surpasses the sixth one. Therefore, it is hard to  assess participation in CSCL activities based on only a single  metric. We need to consider the activity of learning from six  dimensions (as a whole system) to assess students performance.  Thus, we employed the K-means clustering method to classify  students according to their behaviors in the system across  measures. This approach establishes sets of students with  behavioral similarities previously invisible to teachers and  students.    4.1 Clustering Results     Using the K-means algorithm, Table 2 shows the final clustering  results. The values under each cluster are the mean scores for the  corresponding measurements.                  Table 2. K-means Clustering Results  3 Clusters   4.1.1 Interpretation  Interpretation of results from the cluster analysis is a matter of  comparing the means of each cluster across the six measures. For  instance, cluster 1 has the highest mean in the Subject, Rules and  Division of Labor measures, but the lowest mean in the  Community and Object measures. By referencing how each of  these measures was defined in Table 1, we can interpret the  participation results of students in this cluster. In future research  we will explore visualization of results to make interpretation  simpler for teachers. Below, we examine each measures  distribution with interpretations and discuss the characteristics of  student participation in VMT activities followed by a  recommendation for teachers. These clusters are ordered by  cluster size.   4.1.2 Cluster 1: Personally Participative, Active,  Limited Communication  This group of students has 11 members who tend to be personally  participative since they have the highest value (0.772) on the  Subject dimension, which is reflected by a student personal  endeavors or efforts on individual modules or tasks. Therefore,  they are actively exploring the VMT environment on their own  even though there is no peer pressure on them to participate in  group projects. In addition, those students are also rated highest  (0.483) on Division of Labor and Rules (0.322), which means  each student in this cluster contributes significantly in the group  projects or tasks such as geometry artifact construction using  varying functions residing in the VMT environment.   The other three dimension Tools (0.038), Community (-0.385),  and Object (0.438) are ranked medium across the three clusters.  Considering that their measure on Division of Labor is larger than  the other groups, it is easy to infer that these students are very  active in some of the modules but are perhaps inactive in others.  In addition, the teacher should consider encouraging those  students to have more interaction with the students in their group  in that they were rated relatively low in the Community measure.  Still, in general, students in this cluster have the highest  performance in CSCL activities.    4.1.3 Cluster 2: Collaboratively Participative, Not  Deep into Learning  This cluster has 12 students in it who are not as personally  participative compared to students in Cluster 1. However, they  have the highest score on the Object dimension (0.450), which  mainly measures how active those students were in various   Cluster Size  Cluster1 Cluster2 Cluster3   11/31 12/31 8/31   Measure Range (Standardized) Cluster Means   Subject [-1.38, 3.27] 0.772 -0.238 -0.704  Tools [-4.91, 0.65] 0.038 -0.082 0.071   Community [-1.28, 2.71] -0.385 0.862 -0.764  Rules [-1.63, 2.53] 0.322 0.181 -0.714   Division of Labor [-1.09, 3.52] 0.483 -0.354 -0.132  Object [-2.35, 1.48] 0.438 0.450 -1.277   -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35  Z- sc  or e   of  m  ea su  re    Individual/Student   Measurements for Students-Standardized   Subject/Individual Rules/Constraints Tools/System + wb Community/Awareness+Chat Division of Labor/Geogbra Object/Modules  64    modules. In addition, students in this cluster have the highest  value on the Community (0.862) measure indicating that those  students actively communicate with their team members.  Nonetheless, those students have the lowest measure on Division  of Labor. This shows that even though they actively participate in  conversations within their own groups, they made limited  contributions to geometry object construction. This may also be  reflected from their score on the Tools as the lowest -0.082  because those students mainly engaged in the chat function but do  not actively employ tools and functions that the VMT  environment offers.    The teacher might infer that these students are not that  familiar with the VMT software environment since they are not  devoted to building geometry objects using various functions  (Tools). They might just master the basic functions such as using  chat to communicate with other students. Therefore, the teacher  could spend more time introducing the environment or preparing  better introductory materials for the students in this cluster.  Generally, students have a medium performance in this cluster.    4.1.4 Cluster 3: Less Participative, Great Group  Learner  This cluster has 8 students who performed poorly in personal  learning tasks, because for the Subject dimension, which requires  personal endeavors in learning modules, they have the lowest  score (-0.704). Similarly, they did not participate in the group  module well: they have the lowest score on Object (-1.277), which  consists mainly of group tasks and modules. Also, students in this  cluster have the lowest value on the Community dimension (- 0.764) reflecting that they did not engaged in communication with  their team members. However, these students have the highest  score on the Tools measure (0.071), which shows that they  actively explore the VMT environment and used various functions.  Nevertheless, these students might get too focus on the geometry  construction related functions but overlook others, therefore, they  are rated the lowest in the Rules (-0.714). In sum, these students  are the poorest performers among the three groups.    5. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION  Current assessments in CSCL are time consuming, or lacking in  reliability, validity or individual accountability. Our work here  does not claim to address those shortcomings. Instead, it is hoped  that this assessment method may serve as a supplemental tool for  helping to identify individual student trajectories and categories in  synchronous, online learning environments like VMTwG.  Specifically, this method is objective in nature because it deals  with trace data of students actions automatically recorded by the  VMT environment, and presents those interactions through the  lens of Activity theory. When the methodology is set, it would get  the same results every time (given the same actions by the same  students). In the traditional methods, different teachers may grade  or assess students performance differently, and peer assessments  may be affected by various biases [18]. This methodology  improves the reliability of assessment in CSCL.   The objectivity we argue exists in this methodology is not  objective assessment of learning specifically.  We argue that  through the lens of activity theory, the research presented here  demonstrates that student behavior can be compared more reliably  by teachers and other students than would be the case a) without  the specific approach described, b) using a less theoretically  informed method or c) without an intimate knowledge of the  learning activities being examined.  Learning analytics, in this   study, is the intersection of behavioral trace data, theory and  systematic application of established methods of computing  multidimensional similarity. Our aim is to support teachers and  students by systematically making behavioral signals visible.    In addition, the proposed method (from measure construction to  clustering results) can be totally automatic. Hence, rather than  coding various interviews, observation notes, and discussions, it  can be realized by a computer program which is much more  efficient. Also, in the traditional assessment methods, there is  often a lack of established standards and protocols in processing  the qualitative interviews or chat log data [11], in turn affecting  the reliability of the assessment method.     In terms of validity, learning and performance is complex in  nature and it is hard to assess by single measures such as tests,  quizzes or essays [2, 32]. These traditional methods are not able to  incorporate learning that happens in the process and the context.  Our methodology focuses on process, learning environment and  context for learning and performance assessment (participation in  collaborative activities). While learning continues to be evaluated  principally at the individual level, systems like VMTwG focus on  the small group unit of analysis. Through our systematic approach,  and the continued development of approaches like ours, we think  time consuming assessment and research methods can be  accelerated.    Some courses or training programs (like that analyzed here) are  geared more toward exploration. Foci of these courses are more  prone to impart concepts or explore into a subject (like geometry)  [33]. Students do not generate objects or artifacts for teachers to  assess. The learning is integrated in the process. In such cases,  traditional methods such as tests or evaluation of the final product  might not be a good fit to measure this type of learning or  performance. By contrast, our proposed method is a powerful way  to assess performance and participation in the learning process.  This gives teachers an insight into the holistic participation of  students in collaborative online activities. Cluster results provide a  window into what is going on in the activity system of individual  students so that teachers can more fully address student  participation in collaborative learning and use other means (such  as qualitative analysis) to investigate student collaboration quality.    One of the major means of assessment in CSCL is to evaluate  group tasks and or individual tasks, then assign the same grade to  the group or differentiate the grade by looking at participation in  individual tasks within the group. In the current educational  context, which highlights individual success and effort, group  grading may not be an ideal solution [2]. Our method emphasizes  individual contribution and endeavors in the CSCL activities in a  more objective and reliable way.  If, as Stahl argues [34], group  cognition is the product of interactions between group members,  than the scalability of technologically mediated small group  learning will require new ways of assessment at scale.   6. LIMITATIONS  The proposed method is purely quantitative. It does not consider  the quality of ultimate artifacts or objects that might be generated  at the end of a course or training program. In addition,  communication and language is also a powerful way of learning  [35, 36]. A lack of systematic assessment of the qualitative  aspects of collaborative work is one of the limitations of our  proposed method. For instance, researchers less familiar with the   65    VMTwG environment and without experience analyzing  interactions in the environment would have a difficult time  replicating our results in another context. Still, this method can  serve as a supplemental tool to dampen or provide triangulation  for evaluations of performance and outcomes from qualitative or  other assessment methods of learning and performance in CSCL.   7. FUTURE WORK   A combination of qualitative and quantitative assessment  measures may offer the best way to assess learning and  performance in a CSCL environment. However, qualitative  assessment is often time consuming. We are going to explore  natural language processing of the chat log data and incorporate it  into our activity theory measure construction system in order to  further inform learning assessment in CSCL. Additionally, our  clustering approach puts individuals with similar behavior  patterns into groups, and it would be helpful to further explore  approaches that are able to identify individual behavioral  distinctions. Last, because this work solely focused on a purely  CSCL setting, the applicability of this methodology to other  learning environments needs to be tested.   Our future studies will explore dynamic constructions of student  relations and understanding of mathematical constructs through  tool use; articulated previously as instrumental genesis [37].   Nardi & Kaptelinin [38] described how instrumental genesis could  inform the development of activity theory as a lens for practical  HCI design.  In this paper, we have applied knowledge from  working within a system over a course of years to a specific way  of synthesizing insight from a combination of activity theory and  computation; theoretically informed data mining.  The double  loop learning [39] and research we are aiming for will  reconceptualize the design of systems, the logs those systems  generate and the analysis provided back to users.  Perhaps  beginning with consideration of feedback during the design cycle   and a corresponding primacy of what log data to generate  will  inspire a new era in learning analytics and learning technologies  design.     8.

INTRODUCTION  The goal of Data Mining is to enhance the knowledge by  interpreting implicit and gathered data. If the data itself or the  context where it is used relates to education, the research approach  is called Educational Data Mining [16]. Romero & Ventura stated  in 2010 that educational data mining (EDM) is a field that exploits  statistical, machine-learning, and data-mining (DM) algorithms  over the different types of educational data. Learning Analytics  (LA) can be seen as a further development and as a step towards a  more human based assistance. Baker et al [1] mentioned that both  research fields have an extensive overlap, but also subtle  differences. EDM is more or less about using data to understand  how learning occurs and how to improve it. LA strives to assist  the learning process by giving educators a deeper insight to it  based on data analyses. Duval [7] pointed out that we have to  think about learners traces and their learning efforts. Siemens and  Baker [18] defined LA as the measurement, collection, analysis  and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for  purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the  environments in which it occurs. So it can be concluded that the  educator or the teacher plays an essential role in LA, because she  or he is responsible for intervening in a pedagogical manner if the  data analyses points out any hint [8].   Graz University of Technology has been developing math trainers  since 2010 with the aim to improve the basic math education for  primary schools [9]. First of all the so-called 1x1 trainer [17] was  implemented, followed by the multi-math-coach [10] as well as  the addition / subtraction trainer1.    In primary schools, learning the one digit multiplication table is  one of the major goals in the four-year period of education.  Language implications in general [13], the role of math as first  non-native language [14] and pure row learning [11] are some  of the difficulties of this learning problem. Therefore a web-based  application was developed which can both assist the learning  process of the pupils and the pedagogical intervention of the  teachers. According to the needs of the learners, four main parts  are provided from the application: (a) the system is able to define  a competence level of the learner; (b) the system is able to choose  the given exercises according to the competence level of the  learner. The implanted algorithm is responsible that the exercise is  neither too easy nor too difficult; (c) the system ensures that  already well-done exercises are repeated and practiced on a  regular basis; (d) the system has to be appropriate for children  from the age of 7-10 from the usability point of view.

This application was introduced to  schools more than 1.5 years ago and it seems to be a success,  because up to now, we have been able to gather more than  400.000 calculations done by children.    Several educational, pedagogical and psychological surveys  classify various pupils common errors in one digit multiplications  and denote patterns of easy questions to learn, such as doubles,  times five and square numbers [5, 12, 19]. However we could find  no previous work dealing with the problem of one digit  multiplication table computationally. This paper presents a  computational analytical approach using a Markov chain model  and classification algorithms.   In this publication we start first by analyzing the reaction times  and the probabilities of the answer types. The goal is to detect the  set of questions where the pupils mostly have problems to answer  correctly. Next we go through studying the Markov chain model  of different orders. Markov chains are used to model stochastic  processes such as navigation models [3, 4, 6, 15]. We are  especially interested in studying the regularities in learners  answers and finding the structures that may reveal a positive or  negative effect on learners answers to the subsequent questions.  Finally we represent our results and discuss our findings.   2. METHODOLOGY  MARKOV CHAIN  A finite discrete Markov chain of the first order is a sequence of  random variables X1, X2, X3, , Xn for which the following  Markov property holds:    P (Xn+1 = xn+1 | X1 = x1, X2 = x2, Xn = xn) = P (Xn+1 = xn+1 | Xn = xn)   We assume that the probabilities do not change as a function of  time, hence the Markov chains are time-homogeneous.   A Markov chain of order k is described formally as follows:   P (Xn+1= n+1 | X1=x1, X2=x2, Xn=xn) = P (Xn+1 = xn+1 | Xn = xn, Xn-1  = xn-1, , Xn-k+1 = xn-k+1)   The Markov chain of first order is called memoryless, meaning  that the next state depends only on the current state. Considering  the Markov chain of order k, the probability of the next state  depends on the k previous states. A transition matrix P of all  stochastic transition probabilities between the states represents the  Markov model.   3. DATASET  In this paper we perform our analysis on the dataset from the  database of 1x1 trainer application. Our dataset initially  contained 442910 answered questions by 3381 pupils over 11711  sessions. A first manual analysis of data made clear that there was  some noise in the dataset such as unserious user answers. There  were also cases where the users had left the application before  reaching timeout. The dataset is cleaned and hence reduced to  438368 answered questions by 3377 pupils over 11609 sessions.  The application puts each question to the pupils at least two times.  Based on the correctness / incorrectness of the submitted answers  in the user history, the answers for each question are classified  into one of six different answer types. If a pupil answers a  question for the first time correctly (answer type R that stands for  RIGHT), the same question is asked once again later on to ensure  that the answer is truly known by the pupil. If a question is  answered correctly for the second time (answer type RR), the  application assumes that the user had already known the answer to  the put question truly. By contrast, if the pupil answers the   question incorrectly in the second round (answer type RW), the  application keeps on asking the same question later on until the  pupil answers it correctly (answer type WR). Answer type W   (stands for WRONG) implies the first incorrect answer to a  question. Answer type WW implies an incorrect answer to a  question after a preceding wrong answer. The following example  illustrates how the answer types are assigned to each given  answer. Assuming the application has put a pupil 5 times the  question 9*3 in his history and the pupils answers have been as  follows: 27, 24, 26, 27, 27. The assigned answer types for this set  of answers would be: R, RW, WW, WR, RR. The defined answer  types build the states of the Markov chain model in our analysis.  Table 1 lists these six defined answer types and their definitions.   Table 1. Six different answer types and their definition.       R stands for Right and W for Wrong.   Answer  type Definition   Preceding  answer   Current  answer   R First correct answer - R   W First wrong answer - W   RR Correct answer given a preceding correct answer R R   RW Wrong answer given a preceding correct answer R W   WR Correct answer given a preceding wrong answer W R   WW Wrong answer given a preceding wrong answer W W     Since our experiments are based on the statistical analysis, the  distribution of the asked questions by the application may affect  the reliability of the results. About 12 out of 90 questions exhibit a  much lower frequency than the average. That is due to the fact  that many pupils do not go through all the questions and leave the  application too early. Consequently some of the questions are  answered less frequently than the others.   4. DIFFICULT QUESTIONS  The probabilities of the occurring answer types in the dataset  reveal the most difficult questions for the pupils. To identify the  difficult questions most efficiently, we divided the dataset into  two subsets. The first subset includes only the R and W answer  types. The second subset includes only RW, WR and WW answer  types. The following two subsections deal with these analyses in  detail.   4.1 Subset: R and W Answer Types  This subset (R and W answer types only) includes the questions  that are answered by the pupils for the first time either correctly or  incorrectly. The goal is to identify the questions that were mostly  already known (hence easy) und those that were mostly already  unknown (hence difficult) to the pupils before a learning process  actually begins. Figure 1 illustrates the histogram of the 30 most  unknown asked questions (W answer type) within this subset  sorted according to the frequency of unknown questions in  descending order. At first sight, it is obvious that the pupils knew  most of the questions beforehand. A total of 12531 out of 158741  questions were answered incorrectly. 7*8 and 6*8 are the first two  questions with which most pupils had difficulties, whereas the  frequency of both questions (unknown) is too close to each other.   As mentioned before, about 12 out of 90 questions exhibit a much  lower frequency than the average in the dataset. Especially these  questions are unapparent in the statistics, as a low number of   69    pupils had answered. To overcome this problem, the proportional  percentage of unknown (W answer type) to known (R answer  type) questions was taken into consideration. Comparing the  results, we were able to observe that the set of most unknown  questions is mostly the same.     Figure 1. Histogram of the most 30 unknown asked questions   within the subset of R and W answer types.  The 1x1 trainer application provides ninety questions beginning  with 1*1 to 10*9. Figure 2 shows a heatmap that illustrates these  questions in respect of their easiness (known by high number of  pupils) and difficulty (unknown by high number of pupils). As  expected, it is to some extent symmetric. It illustrates that the  multiplications where 1, 2, 5, and 10 occur as operand can be  classified as easy or most known questions, whereas 3, 4, 6, 7, 8  and 9 as operands build multiplications that can be classified as  difficult or most unknown. Considering the proportional  percentage of questions instead of the pure number of unknown  questions, the same results can be observed.     Figure 2. Heatmap of the asked unknown questions   (multiplications) within the subset of R and W answer types.  Rows and columns correspond to the multiplication operands.  If we consider the reaction times consumed by the pupils  especially for the set of known (easy) answers (R answer types),  we can observe that the pupils needed more time for the identified  (difficult) unknown questions than the identified easy ones. Figure  3 illustrates this result in a heatmap. It shows the average time  consumption for each question individually from the set of known  questions. This observation confirms our results on the identified  difficult and easy questions. Furthermore it is apparent that the  pupils needed more time for 6*8 than 7*8. Our observation from   the analysis of the second subset of data (subset of RW, WW and  WR answer types) confirms our finding at this step (see the next  subsection).     Figure 3. Heatmap of the average time consumption from the   set of asked known questions (multiplications) within the  subset of R and W answer types. Rows and columns   correspond to the multiplication operands.   4.2 Subset: RW, WR and WW Answer Types  This subset (RW, WR and WW answer types) includes the  questions answered by the pupils at least for the second time. The  subset includes questions that the pupils answered incorrectly at  least once in their history. The goal is to identify the questions  with the highest probabilities (most difficult). These are the  questions that the pupils repeated most often until they got the  correct answer. Correspondingly the lowest probabilities reveal  the questions that are easy to learn.  Figure 4 illustrates the histogram of the 30 most difficult  questions within this subset.      Figure 4. Histogram of the most 30 difficult questions within   the subset of RW, WR and WW answer types.  6*8 and 7*8 are again the first two questions that have the highest  probabilities. The heatmap of easy and difficult questions (low  and high probabilities) is pretty much the same as the one from  the subset of R and W answer types depicted in figure 2. The  same operands were identified for easy and difficult questions.  We divided the subset further into correct (WR answer types) and  incorrect (RW, WW answer types) answers. We could observe the  same results from both subsets as well. Considering the reaction  times within this subset for correct answers (WR answer types)  we could observe the same results as we did in the first subset (R   70    and W answer types). The heatmap of the average time  consumption for each question individually from the set of correct  answers (WR answer type) looked pretty much the same as the set  of R answer types depicted in figure 3. This observation confirms  our findings about the identified difficult and easy questions.   5. STRUCTURES IN ANSWER TYPES  In this section we present our experimental results from the  analysis of Markov chains. In our Markov model, the answer  types to each question represent the states and the probabilities to  the answer types of the subsequent questions in the sequence as  transition links between the states. Hence we built a Markov  matrix of the size 6*6 representing the transition probabilities  between our 6 different defined answer types.    First we analyze the Markov model globally over all datasets.  Figure 5 illustrates the Markov chain probabilities (in %) of self- transitions for each answer type by growing order k. These are  transitions from one state to itself. For the sake of demonstration,  only the first 5 orders are depicted here.   Answer types  k = 2k = 1 k = 3 k = 4 k = 5  R  W   69.66    30.44  RR   12.8     87.2  RW   53.29     46.71  WR   7.11     92.89  WW   10.15     89.85  Others    31.01     68.99   71.52     28.48   23.03     76.97   77.59     22.41   9.37     90.63   16.14     83.86   55.29     44.71   72.26     27.74   42.28     57.72   89.02     10.98   7.69     92.31   29.30     70.70   66.51     33.49   72.66     27.34   51.38     48.62   92.48     7.52   0     100   39.13     60.87   74.98     25.02   72.92     27.08   50.00     50.00   93.57     6.43   0     100   41.67     58.33   80.63     19.37    Figure 5. Markov chain probabilities of self-transitions (in %)   for each answer type and for order k <= 5.  As can be seen, besides RW, the probabilities for all answer types  increase by ascending k. For example the probability of transition  from WW to WW state is about 31% (k = 1). By k = 2 the  probability increases to 55.29%, by k = 3 to 66.51% and so forth.  It means that assuming a pupils last answer is of type WW, he  will answer the next asked question with the probability of 31%  incorrectly again (at least for the second time). If a pupils last two  answers are of type WW, the probability that he repeats this  behavior increases to over 50% for the next asked questions. The  k-probabilities for answer type R show that pupils who already  know a question, will most probably (about 70%) know the next  questions too. This is also true for RR answer type. In this case the  probabilities increase even up to 93% in the fifth step. By contrast,  we cannot claim the same for unknown questions. Our probability  matrix shows than even for k is greater than 5, the probabilities for  answer type W stay under 50%. The probabilities of answer type  RW decreases after the second step und reaches 0 in the early  forth step. This implies that if pupils once answer the questions  correctly, they rarely give incorrect answers consecutively in the   second round. The probability decreases as expected in the next  steps to 0. The opposite effect can be seen for answer type WR.  The probabilities increase slowly up to a maximum of 50% for k  values greater than 5.   Another interesting observation we made relates to the alternative  transitions between RW and WR states and vice versa. Figure 6  illustrates this structure clearly. Starting from the state RW, the  transition to the WR state has the highest probability of 46.02%:    P (RW => WR) = 46% for k = 1    By k = 2 the highest probability belongs to the transition that  switches back to the RW state:    P (WR => RW) = 61.02% for k = 2    By k = 3 the probability of transitions back to WR increases to  76.88% and so forth.    P (RW => WR) = 76.88% for k = 3   k = 1 k = 3k = 2 k = 5Answer types k = 4  RW  WR        46.0  25.30       70.69  61.02        76.88  84.77        77.20  86.92        78.79  92.52    Figure 6. Alternative transitions between RW !  WR states   This observation implies that the pupils who run into this structure  would never come out of a loop switching between correct and  incorrect answers for the same given questions. The same holds  true for alternative transitions between WR and RW states. It can  be observed very early, in particular from the second step (k = 1).  In the case that pupils run into this structure while they answer the  questions, teachers can be warned and made aware of that  particular situation.   As a next step we investigated whether our outcomes can be  observed in different difficulty levels relating to the questions. To  reach this goal we used k-means algorithm [2] to classify the  questions in three clusters corresponding to easy, intermediate and  difficult levels. We gained 8 difficult, 22 intermediate and 60 easy  questions. We repeated our experiment in each difficulty level  individually. We could still observe increasing probability in self- transitions as described in the preceding subsection. However the  alternative structure RW ! WR could not be observed within the  big set of easy questions.   6. DISCUSSION  In this work we analyzed the dataset from 1x1 trainer  application that was designed for primary school children to learn  one-digit multiplications. We identified the easiest and the most  difficult questions by looking through the probabilities of different  answer types of the pupils in two different subsets. The reaction  time of the pupils for answering the questions confirmed our  results. The questions that were already known to the pupils  before using the application correspond to the questions that were  identified as easy through our analysis. The multiplications where  1, 2, 5, and 10 occur as operand can be classified as easy to learn,  whereas 3, 4, 6, 9, and especially 7, 8 operands build  multiplications that can be classified as difficult. The identified  class of difficult questions contains eight multiplications as  follows: 6*8, 7*8, 8*6, 8*7, 8*4, 8*8, 6*7 and 4*8. As can be  seen, the difficult set is characterized mainly by the operand 8.    71    Next we analyzed the dataset by applying the Markov chain of  higher orders and found some structures within pupils answer  types that can be relevant for predicting how the pupil will answer  the forthcoming questions. Especially for difficult and  intermediate questions it is of interest to teachers to know  beforehand whether the pupils will have difficulties during work  with the application. The goal is to support teachers to discover  pupils weak points during training in a fast and accurate way.   7. CONCLUSION  The goal of our research was to develop applications for basic  math education, which allow individualizing learning. Each child  should be assisted in their own and personal way. Therefore a  detailed overview was built to assist teachers in their daily work.  The data analyses presented in this publication will help to  improve the application in two different ways: the current  empirical estimated difficulties of the question have to be adapted  to the outcomes of this research work and the estimated learning  state has to be improved according to the outcomes of the analysis  of Markov chains.   Future research studies will be carried out if the two  measurements help pupils learn the multiplication table in a more  individualized way. Bearing in mind that in the past, teachers had  never been able to get such exact data about the learning process  of their pupils, and how to intervene in an appropriate pedagogical  manner, learning analytics must be seen as an important enabler of  future education.   8.

INTRODUCTION  Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) like Carnegie Learnings  Cognitive Tutor (CT) [7] adapt to learners evolving knowledge  by tracking their performance as opportunities to practice  particular knowledge components (KCs), or skills, are  encountered. CTs probabilistically assess learner mastery of KCs  and dynamically present problems based on KCs a learner has yet  to master.  The educational effectiveness of adapting to cognitive  factors in this manner is well established [6][9], and many recent  efforts have focused on enhancing both the educational and  motivational effects of the software by personalizing instruction  based on non-cognitive factors [2][4][12].    In this paper, we focus on context personalization, wherein  features of an instructional program are matched to individual  learners personal interests and experiences [11]. Carnegie  Learnings MATHiaTM software is a CT-based ITS for middle  school mathematics which asks learners to specify domains of  their interest (e.g., sports & fitness, arts & music) and uses this  information to pick word problems for individual learners.  MATHia also provides the ability for learners to specify names of  friends or classmates, which become the names of characters  appearing within problems. Both personalization on content and  names have been shown, in prior experiments, to improve  learning outcomes (e.g., improved problem solving, motivation,  and engagement) [1][3][5].    Walkington [12] found, in an experimental version of CT, that  content personalization improved learning outcomes, particularly  on difficult problem steps and on problems with high reading  level. This work was done on a small number of instructional  units, which were completed by learners in a few weeks. Our  focus here is to look at the long-term sustained impact of  personalization across a whole school years worth of curriculum.  We are particularly concerned with how learners react to the  extent to which the system honors their preferences for  particular topics and with whether learners expressing strong  preferences for a topic (or preferences at all) perform differently  than those who have weak preferences or who did not specify  interest area or name preferences.   2.

In particular, MATHia introduces several non-cognitive,  context personalization features.     Figure 1. Screenshot of typical, non-personalized algebra  problem solving in MATHia, with a worksheet/table to   provide answers to parts of the problem scenario and a graph  to plot points ( Carnegie Learning, Inc.)   MATHia contextually personalizes word problems to learner  preferences in two ways.  First, MATHia allows learners to rate  four interest area domains (on a scale of one to five stars) for  which mathematics word problems have been tailored: sports &  fitness, money & business, arts & music, and environment &  nature1.  Second, MATHia allows learners to set names of their  favorite classmates or friends that can be integrated into the  language of problems.  Learner preferences are optionally set via  a profile, illustrated in Figure 2.  One reason learners may not set  preferences is that they do not discover this profile (whether via  exploration in the software, their peers, or instructors).     Figure 2. MATHia preferences profile    ( Carnegie Learning, Inc.)  Problem assignment in MATHia proceeds in much the same way  as in the CT; problems are presented that maximize the learners  exposure to KCs of which the CT has not judged learner mastery.   However, assuming a learner has provided preference ratings for  one or more interest areas, MATHia probabilistically chooses  problems that also may honor those preference settings.  If two  problems emphasize the same KCs, that set is the maximal set of  KCs the learner has yet to master in a particular section, and one  problem has been written to correspond to an interest area that the  learner has rated higher than the interest area of the other problem  (or that problem is not preference-tailored), then MATHia is more                                                                        1 A fifth area, humor (i.e., comical problem text), is assumed to be   an interest area of all learners.  We leave analysis of problems  tailored to this interest area for future work.   likely (but not guaranteed) to present the problem tailored to the  interest area with the higher rating (or any rating at all).   3. DATA  To summarize overall preferences, we considered a snapshot of a  database that stores learner preferences in MATHia.  This  snapshot contained records for 104,197 learners that logged into  MATHia at least once from its release in 2011 until the middle of  2013.  Of these learners, 59.7% (62,168) set interest area  preferences.  Among those with interest area preferences, 85.2%  (52,938) provided names of friends or classmates.     For detailed analysis of associations between preference settings  and learner performance, we consider data for 2,389 learners,  from eight2 randomly selected middle schools that have a  substantial number of MATHia users, with activity in at least one  MATHia section that includes preference-tailored problems3.   Specifically, we focus on a set of 1,230 learners that graduated  from (i.e., mastered all KCs associated with) at least five  preference-tailoring sections.  On average, these learners were  logged into MATHia for 7.4 hours while working through  sections that include preference-tailored word problems.  Of these  learners, 65.4% set interest area preferences (805 learners) and  71.7% (875 learners) provided names of friends and classmates.    3.1 Summary of Learner Interest Areas  From our overall sample of learners that set preferences in  MATHia, we find that the five star rating is most common, and  that learners most frequently rate sports & fitness with five stars,  followed next by arts & music.  Figure 3 provides overall counts  for each interest area of the ratings they have received.     Figure 3. Frequencies of MATHia interest areas ratings   Two observations lead us to define a more informative notion of  learner preferences:    15.7% of learners with preference settings (9,786  learners) rate all interest areas with five stars.    25.7% of learners with preference settings (16,003  learners) rate all interest areas with the same rating.   Learners that rate all interest areas with the same number of stars  may have little interest in any interest areas; diverse interests in all  areas; or, perhaps these learners are not meaningfully providing  information about their interests.  Since we are not in a position to  disentangle these possibilities, we provide a definition of strong  preferences and posit that, for learners whose preferences meet                                                                        2 Processing fine-grained log data for detailed analyses is time-  consuming, and we have yet to process data for all MATHia  users.  Nevertheless, we have no reason to believe that this  subset is not representative of our broader user population.   3 Roughly 20% of the 300 sections across all three MATHia  course curricula include preference-tailored word problems.   74    this definition, we have informative data to analyze relationships  between honoring preferences and learning.   3.2 Strong Preferences  For MATHia interest areas, we define learners to have strong  preferences if they set at least one interest area with a five star  rating and at least one interest area with a one star rating or no  rating.  We posit that such learners provide more informative  preferences and that these are individuals for whom the notion of  honoring preferences is clear.   By this definition, 61.2% (38,060) of learners in our large sample  with set interest areas have strong preferences.  In our smaller  sample for detailed analysis, 64.3% of learners (805) with set  interest areas have strong preferences.   3.3 Learning Outcomes  Recent analysis of CT usage data for a sample of 3,224 middle  school learners in a Virginia school district [8] provides a set of  CT usage or process variables that are positively associated  with scores on the Virginia Department of Educations Standards  of Learning (SOL) mathematics exam [10].  Since we lack  external measures like standardized test scores or final exam  scores for our sample of MATHia learners, we use these variables  as learning outcomes.   We construct the following variables over MATHia sections that  include preference-tailored word problems from log data for our  sample of 1,230 learners that graduated from at least five such  sections:    assistance_per_problem: average over sections of the  per-section average sum of hints and errors per problem   (log-transformed and normalized per section); this is an  indicator of struggle during problem solving.    sections_encountered: log-transformed number of  sections that a learner attempts that contain preference- tailored problems in MATHia4    sections_mastered_per_hour: log-transformed average  number of sections from which a learner graduates per  hour; this is an indicator of efficiency in working  through material.    total_login_time: total amount of time the learner was  logged into MATHia in sections that include  preference-tailored problems   Given the effectiveness of CT [6] and past results [8], students  encountering more material and proceeding efficiently through it  provide reasonable outcomes, absent external measures. We now  explore associations between the extent to which we  honor  preferences and these learning outcomes.  Then we consider how  learners mere expression of preferences is associated with these  outcomes.   4. ANALYSIS  4.1  Honoring Preferences & Performance  Since MATHia probabilistically presents problems that match  learner interest areas when a set of problems all contain  appropriate KCs that a learner has yet to master, we can expect,  by chance, different learners to experience different rates of                                                                       4 We diverge from [8] and do not include a variable representing   the number of skills encountered in sections of MATHia  because this variable is almost perfectly correlated (r = .99) with  sections_encountered.    experiencing problems that correspond to their preferences. We  call cases where MATHia presented a problem corresponding to  the learners preference honoring that preference. For learners  that set strong preferences, we calculate the proportion of  problems they were presented that match their five star interest  areas, in sections that include preference-tailored problems. We  find that there is a relatively restricted range for this proportion,  illustrated in the histogram for 518 learners in Figure 4.  Even in  sections that include problems tailored to interest areas, most  learners are presented problems that match their interest area(s)  only 10% to 30% of the time.  While the proportion of preference- honoring problems assigned is randomly determined per learner,  making this a natural experiment, the restricted range in this  distribution must be kept in mind in interpreting results.     Figure 4. Histogram of strong preference learners (n = 518)   counts & the proportion of preference (i.e., interest area)  honoring problems presented   Despite this restricted range, we consider correlations of honoring  interest areas for strong preference learners with the four learning  outcomes we have chosen.  To illustrate, Figure 5 is a scatterplot  of assistance_per_problem and the proportion of preference  honoring problems.     Figure 5. Scatterplot of assistance_per_problem & proportion   of preference honoring problems for strong preference  learners (n = 518)   Visual inspection of this scatterplot does not lead to an impression  of a strong correlation or association between assistance (i.e., the  extent to which a learner struggles) and honoring preferences.   Table 1 provides quantitative pairwise correlations between  preference honoring and our four learning outcomes and shows  Pearsons r = .14 in the scatterplot of Figure 5.  While three of the  four variables have statistically significant correlations with  preference honoring, none of the correlations are especially large.   Further, controlling for learner efficiency via  sections_mastered_per_hour, we find that the partial correlation   75    of assistance_per_problem and preference honoring is  insignificant (r = .043, p = .33) as is the correlation between  preference honoring and total_login_time (r = .063, p = .154).   This is partially due to expected dynamics of learner interaction  with the tutor and the relatively high correlation of  sections_mastered_per_hour with assistance_per_problem (r =   -.76, p < .001) and with total_login_time (r = -.69, p < .001) in  this sub-sample5.

We  provide one possible explanation of a weak negative association  between preference honoring and learning in the discussion.   However, given a lack of a strong association, we focus on the  broader issue of whether merely expressing preferences is  associated with better learning outcomes.     4.2 Strong vs. Weak Interest Area  Preferences & Performance  First, we compare differences in learning outcomes for learners  that set strong interest area preferences (n = 518) compared to  those that set weak preferences (n = 287).

We  provide calculations of d only for perspective of how                                                                        5 Both correlations are somewhat smaller in the larger sample of   1,230 learners that graduated from at least five preference- honoring sections: for assistance_per_problem, r = -.69 (p <  .001) and for total_login_time, r = -.59 (p < .001).   6 Recall that assistance_per_problem is normalized (i.e., a z- score) across all learners that graduated from at least 5 sections  with preference-tailored problems.   7 We provide mean total_login_time in hours.   substantive significant differences are, as we are working with  observational data and with non-trivial sample sizes.   We find one statistically significant difference at the  = .05 level:  learners with strong preferences tend to work through MATHia  sections that include preference-tailored problems more efficiently  (i.e., have greater sections_mastered_per_hour).  As greater  efficiency is positively associated with an external standardized  test in a previous study, we might predict that learners with strong  preferences may achieve better outcomes as well.  Strong preference learners tend to require assistance less than  those with weak preferences, but the difference is not statistically  significant.  Further, weak preference learners tend to encounter  fewer sections with greater time logged into MATHia sections,  but neither difference is statistically significant.   4.3 Interest Area Preference Settings &  Performance  We now consider differences in MATHia process variables  between learners that set interest area preferences (both strong and  weak, n = 805) versus those learners that did not set interest area  preferences (n = 425).     Table 3 provides a summary of these results.  We find that the  only significant difference is that learners that set preferences seek  (or require) less assistance. While on average they encounter  roughly the same number of sections, working through material  with slightly greater efficiency while logged in for less time, none  of the differences are statistically significant.  Since  assistance_per_problem is negatively associated with external  learning outcomes [8], we would predict that those who merely  set their interest area preferences also achieve better outcomes.

Table 4 presents the  same statistics we have considered but for learners that set names  of classmates or friends (n = 875; of these learners, 721 set  interest area preferences) versus those learners that do not do so (n  = 355; 84 of whom set interest area preferences).     We find that the direction of differences align with trends we  observe for learners with strong preferences and those that set  interest areas, but we find that these differences are all significant  when compared to learners that did not set names.  Learners that  set these names encounter more material while completing  sections more efficiently (and with less assistance) in less time.   That is, overall, they perform better in MATHia on metrics that  have been found to be associated with external learning outcomes.      76    Table 4.

DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK  Our results raise important questions about effects of  personalization, metrics, and ITS design. These results suggest  only weak, possibly negative effects for honoring domain  preferences over a school year. On the other hand, we find some  advantages for learners who set such preferences and, among  those, of learners who have strong preferences. With respect to  specifying names of characters, we find relatively robust effects.   In interpreting these results, it is important to consider the  learners perspective within MATHia. Only a subset of MATHia  problems are word problems that are amenable to the type of  personalization we explore here. In fact, only 20% of sections  contain word problems that could respond to these preferences.  Since preference honoring was probabilistic, the learners  experience would be that a small percentage of problems honor  preferences (even smaller than proportions shown in Figure 4).  Combined with the restricted range of preference honoring, this is  a fairly weak manipulation. In fact, learners may be frustrated that  specifying their preferences has such a small effect on  performance, perhaps leading to the small negative correlation  between the extent to which MATHia honors preferences and  sections_mastered_per_hour. While honoring preferences more  frequently might counter this, it also might be possible to make  preference honoring more visible in the MATHia interface. For  example, future software might notify learners about conditions  that have led to the presentation of a problem (e.g., Because you  like sports, we chose the following).   The findings on setting domain preferences and names of friends  may indicate that some learners are more appreciative of the  opportunity to set preferences, leading to better positive affect  towards MATHia and better outcomes. Alternatively, setting such  preferences may be driven by a factor such as conscientiousness.  Learners who are predisposed to care about their work in math  class may be more likely to set such preferences and more likely  to achieve better outcomes. Differences in the tendency to set  names vs. domain preferences may allow us to better explore this  possibility.  Future work might also include a measure of prior  math ability (lacking in our large but retrospective sample) and/or  confidence or self-efficacy to better understand this association.   Prior research [1][3][5][11][12] has shown that, at the problem  level, we see advantages from personalizing problems. These  experiments typically personalize all problems presented over a  short period of time. To extend these results to everyday  classrooms, we need to understand whether this relatively  intensive personalization will scale to the context where learners  get personalized problems spread out over a full school year. Our  initial results may suggest that personalization at the problem   level needs to be more apparent to learners (either by making it  more frequent or by pointing out the personalization) but also that  the use of personalization features appears to be associated with  improved outcomes. Future work will build on these possibilities.   6. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  We thank Susan Berman, Bob Hausmann, Chas Murray, Tristan  Nixon, and Michael Yudelson for comments on this work.   7.

INTRODUCTION In June of 2010, we began an IES-funded development  project called Helping At-risk students Learn Fractions (HALF). The long-term goal of HALF is to develop and pilot test a complete, technology-based fractions intervention program for fifth- and sixth-grade students. Research suggests that manipulatives (e.g. fractions circles, fractions strips) pos- itively impact students conceptual and procedural under- standing of fractions without impeding their ability to com- plete algorithmic procedures involving fractions [3].

LAK14, March 24 - 28 2014, Indianapolis, IN, USA Copyright 2014 ACM 978-1-4503-2664-3/14/03 ...$15.00. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567574.2567628.  fore, the HALF intervention program fully integrates vir- tual manipulatives into all aspects of instruction, and stu- dents learn to create and interpret visual models of fractions problems.  The complete HALF intervention program combines indi- vidualized instruction facilitated by a technology-enhanced learning environment (TELE) with small-group and whole- class instruction facilitated by a teacher. We intend for teachers who implement HALF in their classrooms to use data generated as students work individually on the TELE to inform all the instructional decisions that they make. We developed the entire HALF intervention program, which in- cludes the analytics about the manipulatives that are em- bedded in the TELE, using a design research methodology that involves iterative cycles of design, enactment, analysis, theory refinement, and redesign [2]. Although the learning analytics for our program are still under development, by our own analysis, the quality of the quantitative data we have been able to collect via the TELE about student learn- ing with manipulatives has improved dramatically since the beginning of the project. In addition, the extent to which we are able to translate the data collected by the TELE into actionable instructional recommendations for teachers rather than static results that teachers must still interpret before applying them to their instructional practice has also improved dramatically. We believe these improvements will ultimately have a positive impact on the effectiveness as well as the scalability of the intervention program.  In this paper, we explain part of the design research pro- cess that we used to develop the learning analytics for the HALF program for the purpose of sharing effective design re- search methods with the broader community of learning an- alytics researchers. In particular, we highlight a set of quali- tative interviews that we conducted with individual students after a short study in which students in three classes at the same school learned to use the virtual manipulatives to com- pare pairs of proper fractions and order groups of 3 proper fractions. The purpose of this is to demonstrate how the results of qualitative research provided insights into design changes for the interactions students have with the virtual manipulatives, which in turn improved the quality of the analytics produced by the TELE. We also emphasize the importance of using mixed-methods during the iterative cy- cles of development that define design research.  2. CLASS LEARNING ZONES The theory behind the Zone of Proximal Development  (ZPD) [7] is that an individual learns the most when the  78    skill or knowledge required for a task is not proportionally too great for the individuals ability. If the task is too easy relative to ability, there is little for the individual to learn; if the task is too hard, the individual does not have a suffi- cient foundation and cannot be successful. Evaluation data helps a teacher know where each students current skill level lies in order to know the best place to start instruction, but a number of factors can contribute to if and how teachers integrate data on student performance into lesson planning and instruction. A teachers level of content knowledge and data literacy skills can preclude understanding of the pro- vided data and prevent it from being utilized [5]. Teach- ers may have personal biases against data, believing instead that personal experience and intuition are better sources of decision-making [4]. Time also plays a role; teachers have an increasing number of demands on their time during the school day, so there is not always enough time to properly evaluate empirical information and use it to generate in- structional content [4].  While it is not reasonable to expect a classroom teacher to use evaluation data drawn from 20-35 students to specifically tailor every lesson they teach to exactly match each students individual ZPD, Murata and Fusons [6] work shows that teachers can create a Class Learning Zone (CLZ) that ad- vances students through their individual Zones while work- ing as a class unit. The idea of CLZ is used to conceptualize how one teacher can enact the ZPD framework for an entire class of students. Although a class may have 20-35 students, when a teacher introduces new content to students, the ma- jority of students use 3 to 6 solution strategies to solve prob- lems related to that content. Students who fail to master the content on the first try are likely to make one of a small set of predictable errors. Of course, random errors exist and it is always possible for a student to use a novel method of solving a problem, but CLZ suggests that classroom teach- ers and specialized technologies can work synergistically to provide students with the adaptive instruction that they re- quire.  2.1 Long-Term Learning Analytics Goals Rather than reporting only summaries of student perfor-  mance, our long-term goal for the analytics that we develop for the HALF intervention program is for the system to be able to aggregate data gathered by the TELE into summa- tive reports that impact teachers ability to enact CLZ. We aim for the system to aggregate information about individ- ual students and then organize the reports in a summary format that groups together students with similar learning trajectories. We also aim for the system to deliver actionable instructional recommendation for each group that teachers can use to inform their pedagogy as they plan lessons before class and then implement those lessons during class. The study reported in this paper describes only one small step towards these ambitious long-term goals, but it represents how we learned to use qualitative research as an important component of the design research process.  3. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM The TELE used in this intervention was implemented as a  web application hosted on a portable server situated in the classroom. The TELE presented two distinct interfaces: an interactive learning environment for students and a report- ing interface for teachers. Both interfaces were implemented  Figure 1: The student workspace interface.  Figure 2: The summary report interface.  in the browser using modern web standards and were de- signed for touch screen interaction. Students experienced the TELE via iPads.  The user interface for the virtual manipulatives (see Fig- ure 1) includes a large, rectangular box called the workspace on the left side of the screen. Students create models of frac- tions in the workspace using a set of denominator buttons. Students shade the number of pieces that corresponded to the numerator of each fraction by tapping individual pieces or swiping across a group of pieces. Practice problems ap- peared on the right side of the screen. For the purpose of answering research questions about feedback that are not the focus of this paper, students assigned to different treat- ment conditions received different types of feedback from the system. Traces of student activity generated by the system are stored in a relational database by the web application for further use.  The teacher reporting interface presents two views that are updated dynamically as the students work with the TELE. The summary view (see Figure 2) gives an overview of the students progress on the current activity. Each cell contains two accuracy indicators: question response (upper-left) and model (lower-right). The detail view (see Figure 3) is acces- sible by clicking a students name or identifier in the sum- mary view. This view allows the teacher to examine indi-  79    Figure 3: Sample entries from the student detail report.  vidual problem responses for a student. Each entry displays both the students response to the problem and the model they constructed.  4. METHODS The study took place in a public charter school located  in the state of Tennessee (USA) that served primarily low- achieving, minority students from low-income families. The sample for the intervention included 41 students (26 female and 15 male) drawn from 3 intact, fifth-grade mathematics classes (10-11 years old). On the first day of the interven- tion, a researcher led a general class discussion about frac- tions, introduced the virtual manipulatives to the students, and then briefly demonstrated how to use the manipulatives to compare the relative size of two fractions. The students then used iPads to complete a 10-question, multiple-choice, pre-test. Five of the problems asked students to compare two fractions and indicate which fraction was larger or indi- cate that the two fractions were equal. The remaining five problems asked students to order a group of three fractions from smallest to largest. The system required students to build a model of each problem before submitting the answer to the problem. The system recorded the accuracy of the students models along with the accuracy of their responses. On the second day of the intervention, the researcher con- ducted a lesson that included a review of the concepts stu- dents learned the previous day, two class discussions, and two practice sessions. During each pratice session, students answered as many practice problems as they were able to answer during the time limit, and they received feedback about their answers from the system. Students assigned to different treatment conditions received different types of feedback. On the third day of the intervention, the students completed a 10-question post-test that was identical to the pre-test. A research assistant took field notes in each class on every day of the study.  After the intervention, two researchers visually analyzed the dynamic web reports generated for each class and for each individual student for the purpose of choosing students from each class to interview individually. The researchers ultimately chose to interview 7 students (3 male and 4 fe- male). The data for each student chosen for an interview differed from the data of their classmates who were not cho- sen for interviews in various ways, but all of the students who were interviewed achieved low scores on the post-test. Prior to the interview with each student, the 2 researchers compiled notes that summarized their observations of each student from the dynamic web reports and the field notes  taken during the intervention and set goals for what data to collect during the interview. One researcher then inter- viewed all 7 students. These interviews were audio recorded.  The researcher who conducted the interviews began each one by asking the students general questions about their reg- ular mathematics class and their experiences during the in- tervention. She then asked students to talk aloud as they solved problems from the post-test. The researcher used each students answers along with the summative notes to determine whether the evidence suggested that any specific misconceptions or incomplete understandings could explain that students low scores on the post-test; if so, she used var- ious pedagogical strategies to attempt to address the mis- conceptions and/or incomplete understandings. If the re- searcher could not identify any particular misconception or incomplete understanding, she asked probing questions that were designed to determine what other factors might explain why the student achieved a low score. Each interview was audio recorded and lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. The researcher who conducted the interviews wrote notes that summarized her findings immediately after each interview. A research assistant transcribed all of the audio recordings from the interviews. Three researchers individually coded and analyzed the qualitative data and then compared the re- sults of their analysis. The qualitative results reported below represent the summative findings of all three researchers.  5. RESULTS On average, the ability of students who participated in  the intervention to compare pairs of proper fractions and to order groups of 3 fractions using virtual manipulatives im- proved between pre-test (M = 0.67, SD = 0.28) and post- test (M = 0.79, SD = 0.27). The effect size of the difference was moderate (d = 0.52), and a paired t-test showed that it was statistically significant (t = 3.34, p < 0.01). How- ever, the response accuracy for the 7 students we interviewed was substantially lower than their classmates at post-test (M = 0.34, SD = 0.24). The students scores at pre-test and their performance during the practice activities varied, but in general, the students we interviewed achieved less than their classmates who were not interviewed on these performance indicators. The qualitative data we collected from all these 7 students impacted our understanding of how to improve the learning analytics for the HALF inter- vention program. We provide more specific detail about 3 cases in the sections below. We chose to highlight these cases because the quantitative data that we collected about these students during the practice activities and the visual  80    inspections of the summary and detail reports for each stu- dent yielded mostly inconclusive or misleading results while the qualitative data we collected provided particularly infor- mative insights that led to design changes in future versions of the system.  5.1 Student 1 The interview with Student 1 revealed that although the  student successfully learned how to build models of fractions problems, the student completely ignored the model when answering problems and instead relied on a procedural strat- egy for ordering fractions that we did not teach or discuss at any point during the intervention. The strategy involved converting each fraction to an equivalent number that he memorized that presumably should have been the decimal equivalent of each fraction. However, the student applied the strategy incorrectly, which is shown in the excerpt be- low:  Student 1 : Um, I think one half would go first.  Researcher : Okay, how come  Student 1 : Because its one-half equals five  Researcher : One half equals five, what do you mean though, one half equals five  Student 1 : Because its lower than any number, um, than one third  Researcher : Okay, how is it lower  Student 1 : Because one fifth equals, um, twenty- five, and one-third equals three hundred thirty- three  Researcher : Okay. Oh, when you convert it into a decimal  Student 1 : Hmm hmm  Researcher : Oh, okay, so you were converting them into a decimal in your head  Student 1 : Hmm hmm  Researcher : Okay, got it. So what do you think the answer [to this problem] would be  Student 1 : Um, one half, one third, and one fifth  We learned after the interview that Student 1s teacher required his students to memorize the decimal equivalents of common unit fractions. Student 1s answer suggests that he memorized the digits of each decimal equivalent without understanding what type of number (decimal versus whole number) the digits represent. It also suggests that he does not understand place value of decimals. However, the stu- dent still chose to use a procedural strategy involving dec- imals to solve the problem rather than applying the strat- egy that we taught of using virtual manipulatives to build a model of proper fractions and then using the models to compare the relative size of the fractions. When answering other problems, the student used the whole number domi- nance strategy, which is a very common incorrect strategy in which students compare fractions by making separate com- parisons of the numerators and the denominators using the ordering of whole numbers [1].  To address these misconceptions, the researcher showed the student several additional models of groups of proper  fractions. Rather than using word names or symbolic rep- resentations to refer to the fractions that the models rep- resented, she referred to each fraction by the color of the strip that was used to represent it in the model (e.g. the red fraction, the blue fraction) and asked the student to in- terpret the relative size of each part of the model rather than order a group of three proper fractions (e.g. Which fraction has more area shaded The red fraction or the blue fraction). This tactic seemed to improve the students ability to interpret the models and correctly answer prob- lems by the end of the interview. The data collected during this interview helped us develop a method of scaffolding the problem solving process in which we remove any symbols from the problems and require the student to answer the problems by interpreting visual models. This new method of scaffolding helps address the very common whole number dominance strategy as well as any other incorrect strategy in which students build correct models but then answer prob- lems without interpreting the models that they have built.  5.2 Student 2 Despite the fact that Student 2 learned to build correct  models of fractions during our intervention, she demonstrated almost no understanding of fractions during the follow-up interview. In the excerpt below, the student struggles to correctly name a set of three proper fractions that includes 4 8 , 2  3 , and 3  12 .  Researcher : So, whats this one say  Student 2 : Uh, eight fourth, comma, three half  Researcher : And then say the last one  Student 2 : And twelve thirds  Researcher : Okay, well when we read a fraction, the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator, so we read it the other way. Can you try that So what would that be Instead of eight-fourths, what would it be  Student 2 : Uh, eight... Im confused  Researcher : Would it be four-eighths, maybe No How come  Student 2 : Because the four is on the top and the eight is at the bottom  In the next excerpt, the student explains why she chose four eighths as the largest fraction.  Student 2 : Because four is like the biggest, four is like right there on the biggest number and then three is like, like in the middle to be like the highest, but its still like low. And then youve got two thats low, real low. And twelve, it would be it, but its under three, so it cant be it. It would be good if it was under four.  The quantitative data from the post-test results showed that Student 2 had the ability to translate symbolic repre- sentations of fractions into visual models, but the qualitative data collected during the interview confounded the quantita- tive results by showing that Student 2 lacked understanding of the symbolic representations themselves. It also showed  81    that the student lacked the ability to translate symbolic rep- resentations of fractions into word names. We determined that any additional instruction about fractions for Student 2 should assume that the student is at a very early devel- opmental stage of understanding fractions. Data from this interview contributed to our decision to directly assess stu- dents ability to interpret symbolic representations of frac- tions and their ability to translate symbolic representations of fractions into word names. We built additional lessons for the TELE that are intended to help students develop these skills and then make connections between symbolic representations, word names, and visual models of fractions. If students fail to master these lessons via the TELE, we now recommend that they receive direct intervention from a teacher prior to moving on to the more advanced lessons that require students to interpret models of fractions.  5.3 Student 3 During the interview with Student 3, the researcher noted  that the student seemed overwhelmed by the task of using the virtual manipulatives to compare two fractions and order groups of fractions, especially when she answered problems incorrectly and was required to interpret feedback messages from the TELE and revise her answers. The researcher also noted that Student 3 strugled with multi-step processing. For example, when asked to order groups of three fractions, she seemed to have less difficulty interpreting the model if the strips were already ordered visually and could be read from top to bottom or bottom to top. However, if she needed to mentally keep track of the correct order, she seemed to have more trouble interpreting the model. Like Student 2, this student seemed to have difficulty translating between symbolic notation, word names, and visual representations, but her answers to the interview questions suggested this may be explained at least in part by a difficulty with multi- step processing and/or interpreting verbal directions rather than a lack of understanding of basic fractions concepts. When the researcher asked the student to talk about frac- tions only in terms of the color of each fraction strip, she saw noticeable improvement.  The schools records did not indicate that this student had a learning disability, but the qualitative results of our research suggest the Student 3s low performance on the post-test may be explained at least in part by factors that are related to learning difficulties that extend beyond the content taught during the intervention. These results con- tributed to our decision to add a feature to the virtual ma- nipulatives that allows students to easily rearrange the or- der of the fractions strips. They also contributed to the development of a new scaffolding framework that we em- bedded in the system. When students are struggling, the system automatically reduces the complexity of the prob- lem and then gradually increases it when performance im- proves. This method of scaffolding makes the system more accessible to struggling students and students with learning disabilities. It also provides more sophisticated data that allows teachers to more accurately diagnose the source of difficulty for individual students.  6. CONCLUSIONS This paper explains a portion of the design research pro-  cess we used to develop the type of learning analytics that we need to meet our long-term goals, and it highlights the im-  portance of collecting qualitative data about student users. The qualitative interviews we conducted with 7 individual students captured valuable information about the process students used to solve fractions problems with manipula- tives that we had previously been unable to capture. Once we better understood these students process, we were able to redesign the interaction students had with the TELE in ways that provided more useful quantitative data. Because the meaning of interaction traces is defined by the designs of the interactions, refinement of analytics and user interaction with a TELE go hand in hand.  7.

INTRODUCTION The last five years have seen a rapid rise in the popular-  ity of Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs. This rise in popularity has been reflected both in the number of students enrolling in these courses and the number of universities now offering courses in this format. While there are many chal- lenges in providing students with high quality educational experiences at such a large scale, MOOCs have created sig- nificant opportunities for researchers and educators who are interested in learning analytics. The sheer numbers of stu- dents who participate in MOOCs  often in the thousands  means that educators and educational researchers have access to large data sets of students online learning inter- actions which, through the use of learning analytics, can be used to develop a greater understanding of students on- line learning experiences, processes and outcomes [19]. The large data sets created by students interactions in MOOCs provide new opportunities to conduct research on online cur- riculum and assessment structures, students patterns of en- gagement with online material and activities, and the more general areas of student retention and success.  The emerging field of learning analytics is constantly de- veloping new ways to analyze data on students interac- tions, engagement and performance. Key to the usefulness of learning analytics is the ability to provide data to educators in ways and formats that can help inform their decision mak- ing about educational interventions; and curriculum design and redesign. Work is currently being undertaken by many researchers into methods to visualize data in more effective and informative ways [13, 7, 16]. In the context of MOOCs, current access to visualizations of learners data through the more recent MOOC platforms  e.g. edX, Coursera  is somewhat limited. However, this is an area of development that is being informed by the analysis of data from research into early MOOC offerings [12, 15]. Beyond line and bar charts that display frequency counts and the timing of stu- dents activity, examples of the kinds of visualizations that have been generated using MOOC data include social net-  83    work diagrams [13], Q-Q plots of communication activities in forums [4], and log plots of student access to learning activities [5].  This paper presents the findings from an exploratory in- vestigation of students interactions within two MOOCs of- fered by the University of Melbourne. The two main pur- poses of the research were to develop more refined learning analytic techniques that can be used with MOOC data, and to design visualizations of the output that is meaningful to end users (instructors, researchers, students and administra- tors).  The research had the broad aim of seeking to use learning analytics to describe students interactions in and patterns of engagement and success with the two MOOCs being inves- tigated. But more specifically it sought to determine how students interactions were seen to be similar or different across two courses, which had quite different and distinc- tive curriculum and assessment designs. Thus, we sought to develop a greater understanding of students patterns of learning behavior, how we could use learning analytics of interaction and assessment to meaningfully classify student types, and how visual representations could be used to ef- fectively show patterns of student engagement and success across two MOOCs with different curriculum and assessment structures. The findings from this research will not only contribute to the educational communitys understanding of students engagement and performance in MOOCs, but it will also provide the broader learning analytics community with suggestions of ways to approach learning analytic data analysis and the visualization of the results emerging from these analyses.  The research reported in this paper is intentionally de- scriptive and exploratory. A structured approach to data analysis was adopted, based on a technique we have used in previous research [11]. With this approach the specific variables that are analyzed and the results of these analy- ses are determined iteratively at increasingly finer levels of granularity. Given this approach, we have structured the paper by combining methods and results sections to assist the reader. Hence, the paper begins with a brief introduc- tion to both courses and some standard analytics, Section 2 and Section 3. It then revisits these analytics with several iterative refinements, Section 4. It then combines these data refinements with some entirely different analytics in Section 5 and concludes with a discussion of the findings in Section 6.  2. COURSE BACKGROUND This paper examines the interactions of students in the  inaugural sessions of two MOOCs developed at the Univer- sity of Melbourne, Principles of Macroeconomics and Dis- crete Optimization. These two courses were chosen because, although they were both developed by the same produc- tion team and delivered on the same MOOC platform, the course structures and implementations were entirely differ- ent. They varied in subject area, prerequisite knowledge, curriculum design, and assessment design, just to name a few. The remainder of this section provides a brief intro- duction to each of the courses, to provide context for the rest of the paper.  Principles of Macroeconomics is an introductory course with minimal prerequisites. It consists of eight weeks of ma- terial broadly presented in a linear structure. Each week  students are asked to watch newly released videos which cover key principles of the course, and respond to quizzes that provide both formative and summative assessment of students knowledge. A discussion forum and social net- working sites are provided for students so that they are able to collaborate while they undertake their learning in the course. Of the eight available quizzes, three contribute to students final grade (in weeks three, five and eight) while the others are for practice (formative assessment). For the remainder of this paper we will use the term exam to refer to quizzes that count toward the students final grade in the course. Principles of Macroeconomics also contained a peer assessment task where students are required to write a 1,500 word essay on a current topic and to review and grade three other students essays. The inaugural session of this course attracted the interest of 54,217 students, of which 32,598 started the course, and 1,412 students received a certificate of completion for the course (a 4.33% completion rate). This linear course design with quiz and peer-graded assessments is typical of many recent xMOOCs [14].  Discrete Optimization is a graduate level course which assumed that incoming students have a strong background in computer science. It consists of nine weeks of material presented in an open curriculum structure. That is, all of the assignments and lectures are made available in the first week and students design their own study plan to complete at their own pace. The assessments consist of seven pro- gramming assignments: one preliminary, five primary, and one extra-credit. Students are permitted to submit unlim- ited attempts at each assignment and their grade is based on their marks on the final day of the course. Discrete Op- timization included a forum for class discussion, but also encouraged student interaction via a gamification element called the leader board, where students can see how their solutions compare to those of their peers. The inaugural session of this course attracted the interest of 37,777 stu- dents, with 22,731 starting the course, and 795 receiving a certificate of completion for the course (a 3.50% completion rate).  3. UNDERSTANDING A MOOC As discussed previously, both institutions and instructors  are eager to understand how students are engaging with MOOCs. Especially after seeing completion rates between 3% and 5%, instructors and institutions may question the educational success of MOOC offerings. A number of re- search articles on MOOCs have investigated the issue of student retention [12, 15] and examining just this issue  student retention  was the starting point for the series of iterative, exploratory analyses presented in this paper.  In the recently developed xMOOC platforms, instructors and administrators have access to a set of high-level an- alytics related to student engagement, performance, and retention. These analytics typically include summaries of data on areas such as unique views of content, assessment item analysis, and distributions of students assessment out- comes. While the learning analytics capabilities of exist- ing platforms are continually expanding, the range of ana- lytic reports available to course instructors at the time these two courses were conducted were primarily restricted to his- tograms of student participation (video views and assign- ment submissions) and assessment performance (i.e. marks). An example of this data is presented in Figure 1, which in-  84  http://www.coursera.org/course/macroeconomics https://www.coursera.org/course/optimization https://www.coursera.org/course/optimization   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  Week  S tu  d e n t  P  a rt  ic ip  a ti o n  0 2 0 0 0  4 0 0 0  6 0 0 0  8 0 0 0  1 0 0 0 0  All Marks  S tu  d e n ts  0 100 200 300 400  0 5 0 0  1 0 0 0  2 0 0 0  3 0 0 0  Figure 1: Weekly Student Participation (left) and a Histogram of Student Performance (right) for Discrete Optimization.  cludes the activity of the 22,731 students in Discrete Op- timization, broken down by week, and a histogram of stu- dents marks on the assessments.  A preliminary assessment of the analytics presented in Figure 1 indicates that (1) there are many more students viewing the videos than working on the assignments; (2) there is a noticeable and consistent decline in the number of students participating in the course every week; (3) of the subgroup attempting the assignments, the rate of over- all success in the course is quite low, with more than half of the students in the first bar of the histogram. These pat- terns of student behavior shown for Discrete Optimization in Figure 1 are very similar to those for the Principles of Macroeconomics (not shown). One of the most useful in- sights to be gleaned from these results concerns the number of students who participate in assignments. It can be seen that of the 22,731 students who are active in the course, only 6,633 (i.e. 29.2%) attempted the assignments. Using just the sub-population of students who were active in the course assignments, it is possible to revise the completion rate of Principles of Macroeconomics and Discrete Optimiza- tion to 18.1% and 12.0% respectively, which is slightly more appealing.  Conclusions about MOOC completion rates and levels of attrition which are similar to these have been noted by other reports and papers [1, 3, 12, 15]. In many ways, these data visualizations and descriptions mean that Discrete Op- timization looks like a typical MOOC  students have a high degree of initial interest and the course shows high attrition. While these types of visualizations are useful in describing the high-level distribution of activity and marks, they are fairly blunt instruments when it comes to making sense of students interactions, engagement and learning. If we were to rely on these types of analytics alone, we would be able to glean very few additional insights about the reasons behind or concomitants to students success or failure in a partic- ular MOOC. The remainder of this paper outlines a series of alternative analytics that can be harnessed from MOOC  data, which provide instructors, researchers and adminis- trators with novel insights into how MOOCs work and how students interact and engage with them.  4. ALTERNATIVE ANALYTICS: AN ITER-  ATIVE APPROACH There are many possibilities for transitioning from the  highly aggregated analytics presented in Section 3 to more detailed analysis of the wealth of student data collected in MOOCs. We have adopted an approach that involved an iterative analysis of analytics data as proposed in [11]. This process involves making a series of repeated passes at the data, with each pass involving further refinement in analysis at a finer level of granularity. On each pass, patterns are observed in the data and those patterns are used to refine the analysis focus. By repeating this process several times, it is possible to cluster either variables into groups and/or student users into subpopulations to gain further insight.  4.1 Revisiting Student Marks The initial starting point for this type of alternative anal-  ysis was completed by revisiting students marks. In Figure 1 the distribution of student marks was presented as a his- togram with 12 bars. A shortcoming of using histograms to present data is that the information they provide is very sensitive to the number of bars used. For example, the mode of a distribution can easily be obfuscated if the number of bars is too small. An alternative way to visualize distribu- tion data is a cumulative distribution plot, a key advantage of which being that it does not require a fixed number of bars.  Figure 2 shows students marks for Principles of Macroe- conomics and Discrete Optimization as cumulative distribu- tions.1 Marks from all assessments were used in the cre- ation of these distributions, not just those assessments that 1Figures 2, 3, and 4 presented throughout this section were produced in R [18] using the built-in packages.  85    0 20 40 60 80 100 120  0 2 0 0 0  4 0 0 0  6 0 0 0  All Marks  T o ta  l  S  tu d e n ts  Maximum marks after two weeks  0 100 200 300 400  0 1 0 0 0  3 0 0 0  5 0 0 0  All Marks  T o ta  l  S  tu d e n ts  Maximum marks after two weeks  Figure 2: Cumulative Distributions of Student Performance for Principles of Macroeconomics (left) and Discrete Optimization (right).  counted towards the final grade (i.e. the practice quizzes in Principles of Macroeconomics are included). Considering all of the marks allows us to more consistently compare across the courses. With the very granular level of detail provided by the cumulative distribution, we can now see some clear similarities between the courses as evidenced by the similar shapes of the distribution curve. It is also worth noting that for both courses there appears to be anelbow in the distri- bution plot in the region of low student marks. This elbow reflects the point where the significant and sheer drop in the distribution starts to even out into a smoother slope.  Using our knowledge of these courses, we were able to observe that the start of the smooth mark distribution co- incides with the number of marks that can be earned in the first two weeks of these courses, as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 2. This suggests that in the first two weeks many students experiment with the assignments but only a dedicated subgroup (less than 50% in these courses) con- tinues to work on the assignments for the entirety of the course. This new insight into these courses inspires a novel hypothesis about students performance in MOOCs.  Hypothesis 1. Students marks in the first two weeks are a good predictor of the final grade in the course.  In order to explore this hypothesis, we focussed on the marks obtained in the first two weeks in both courses (see Figure 3). To test the hypothesis, we ran a linear regression model for each course considering the association between students marks at the two week point of the course and their final grade, as summarized in Table 1. These regres- sion analyses were significant for both courses (p < 0.001), and there was a higher association for Discrete Optimiza- tion (R2 = 52.7%) than for Principles of Macroeconomics (R2 = 20.6%). However, we noticed that the Principles of Macroeconomics regression greatly benefits from includ- ing the first exam (R2 = 51.5%), which occurs in the third week of the course. For a consistent comparison between the courses, we elect to focus on the students marks at the two week point in both courses.  Table 1: Marks Regression Analysis Summary Course Marks R2 F (d, de) p <  Dis. Opt. 2 weeks 52.7% (1,6612) = 7362.21 0.001 Macro. 2 weeks 20.6% (1,7614) = 1978.71 0.001 Macro. 3 weeks 51.5% (1,7614) = 8081.11 0.001  An implication of these findings is that instead of having to wait until the end of the course to run post-hoc analyses of student performance, the group of students most likely to succeed can be identified early in the course. The great advantage of this to instructors is that they can tailor course material to different types of students. They could, for ex- ample, choose to give their attention to students who appear to have the required skills to succeed and are actively trying to complete the assignments, leading to customization and interventions while the course is in session.  Having established an association between performance in the first two weeks and overall success in the course, we can now identify a particular group of students who had per- formed well in the first two assessments. We call this group the qualified students, and define them as the students who obtained marks above the 60th percentile in the first two weeks of the course, indicated by a dashed line in Figure 3. This group of students are regarded as qualified because their relatively high scores on the first two assessments in- dicates they have substantial prior knowledge [6, 9, 17] in the discipline area, and moreover, they have invested the time required to complete the assignments. For a consistent comparison across both courses we chose the 60th percentile somewhat arbitrarily to define this group. If applied to other courses, this value could be determined on a case-by-case ba- sis after inspecting the two-week mark-distribution plot (i.e. Figure 3).  The qualified subgroup provides another lens for under- standing course completion rates. If we consider the quali- fied students as reflecting a subgroup who had the necessary prerequisites for completing the course  much like prereq- uisites for taking more traditional university courses  then  86    0 5 10 15 20  0 2  0 0  0 4  0 0  0 6  0 0  0 8  0 0  0  Marks After Two Weeks  T o  ta l  S  tu d  e n  ts  60th Percentile  0 10 20 30 40 50 60  0 1  0 0  0 3  0 0  0 5  0 0  0  Marks After Two Weeks  T o  ta l  S  tu d  e n  ts  60th Percentile  Figure 3: Cumulative Distributions of Student Performance for Principles of Macroeconomics (left) and Discrete Optimization (right).  we can revise the completion rate of Principles of Macroe- conomics and Discrete Optimization to 42.1% and 27.4% respectively, which is much more appealing than the 5% to 3% we started with. Table 2 summarizes the completion rate calculations discussed thus far. Along the lines of [11],  Table 2: Completion Rate Calculations Course All Active Qualified  Macroeconomics 4.33% 18.1% 42.1% Discrete Optimization 3.50% 12.0% 27.4%  the identification of this qualified subgroup enables us to re- visit all of the course data in a more detailed manner. The remainder of this paper focuses on how this subgroup can be used to enhance our understanding of learning analytics data with a view to helping instructors better understand the engagement behavior of students in MOOCs.  4.2 Revisiting Weekly Participation In this section we revisit the weekly participation plot  (Figure 1) using the insights from Section 4.1, in terms of both assignment activity and qualified students. Initially total weekly participation was divided into three mutually exclusive subgroups:  1. Auditors, students who watched videos in a particular week, but did not participate in any assessments.  2. Active, students who participated in an assessment in a particular week.  3. Qualified, students who watched a video or partici- pated in an assessment and met the two assessment qualification criteria from Section 4.1.  This analysis is inspired by [12], but the qualified student group provides a new level of detail in the analysis. Figure 4  presents the students weekly participation in both courses and the percentage in each bar indicates the relative per- centage for that week. Now that the data have been divided into groups, a more detailed story of student engagement is revealed in both courses.  For example, some of the novel insights revealed by Figure 4 include: (1) The relative proportions of auditor, active, and qualified students are remarkably similar across both courses, despite the substantial differences in the designs of the courses and their target students; (2) Of the students who are still engaged in the course, the relative proportion of qualified students is broadly maintained over time, unlike the population of active students, which decreases steadily. This is consistent with the transformative shift findings of [20]; (3) The reduced number of active students in weeks five and seven of Macroeconomics suggests that some students only complete the exams and skip the quizzes; and (4) The relative proportion of students who are discontinuing across both courses came from the Active group.  In summary, despite the significant differences in the course structures and assessment designs, these courses exhibit re- markable similarities in relation to student activity, in both performance (total marks) and relative weekly participation. Given these similarities, an obvious question that emerges is: Do students take advantage of the open course structure of Discrete Optimization, or do they naturally conform to the linear delivery structure of Principles of Macroeconomics  5. UNDERSTANDING TEMPORAL ENGAGE-  MENT In the previous sections we have shown how the quali-  fied subgroup can be used to inform completion rate cal- culations (Section 4.1) and weekly participation analytics (Section 4.2).

In this section we investigate students temporal engagement with the course material. Specifically, we con- sider the degree to which students in each course conform to a more traditional linear delivery structure and whether stu- dents in Discrete Optimization particularly take advantage of the open course structure. To investigate this question, we introduce another visualization, called a state transition diagram. We will show how the state transition diagram combined with an analysis of student subgroups can clearly illustrate the differences in students temporal engagement in the two courses.  5.1 State Transition Diagrams Contemporary MOOC platforms collect detailed data about  students online interactions. It is possible to study stu- dents interactions and engagement at both a macro-level (e.g. how many students completed an assignment) and a micro-level (e.g. a click-stream, tracking every interaction a student has with the learning platform). The detail pro- vided by data contained at the micro-level can be seductive, but it can also be incredibly difficult to make sense of such data. In this section, we introduce state transition diagrams as a way of taking detailed time-stamped interaction data and reducing it to a simple visualization which retains useful temporal information.  Originating as finite state automata in the computer sci- ence discipline, the purpose of state transition diagrams is to represent how a system moves from one state to another state over a sequence of events. These diagrams are typically visualized as a graph where nodes represent the states and the lines connecting nodes reflect probabilistic or weighted transitions between states. Previous educational researchers have used state transition diagrams with learning analytics. For example, [10] used state transition diagrams, among other techniques, to analyze logs of students interactions with an online drag-and-drop learning activity. In the con- text of MOOCs, [12] used a form of state transition diagram to show student movement between categories of engage-  ment over assignment periods.  student transitions   from left to right  entry point  line thickness indicates   number of transitions  exit point  student transitions   from right to left  A B circle area is the   number of unique   students to enter   this state  Figure 5: State Transition Diagram Legend.  Figure 5 provides a legend to understand the state tran- sition diagrams presented in this paper. The legend shows two possible states, A and B. The figure shows that stu- dents enter the State A from the top, make transitions be- tween the states, and then exit the State A from the bottom. The arcs above the states indicate transitions from left to right (i.e. from A to B) while the arcs below the states indicate transitions from right to left (i.e. from B to A). Additionally, line thickness represents the relative number of transition made, while the size of the circle for any given state indicates the number of unique students that entered the state. Each states name and size is presented as text inside the circle to aid in the explanation of the visualization in this paper, but this information is not strictly necessary in practice. For consistency across both courses, we present the states linearly, based on the recommended path through the course material. Hence, students following a linear cur- riculum structure will always transition from left to right. Transitions from right to left (i.e. below the states) indicate students exploring the curriculum in a different way. The state transition diagrams presented throughout this section (i.e. Figures 6 and 7) were produced in HTML5 and D3 [2] using customized data processing and layout instructions. This temporal visualization enables us to determine the  impact of an open course structure, such as that used in Dis- crete Optimization, on the degree to which students switch  88    or jump around the course. Furthermore, the visualiza- tion is fairly general, so it can be applied to various forms of temporal data. In the next two sections we will consider the student state transitions with regards to both video views and assignment submissions.  5.2 Video Views Transitions It is typical in MOOCs to break lecture topics into short 5  to 15 minute segments. If each of these micro-lectures were to represent a state in a state transition diagram, too much detail would be provided, making it very difficult to inter- pret. Instead, if videos are able to be grouped by conceptual theme or topic we can observe the major state transitions more easily.2 In Principles of Macroeconomics the video lectures are grouped into six topic areas, while in Discrete Optimization they are grouped into four topic areas.  Figure 6 presents the video view state transitions diagrams from both Principles of Macroeconomics and Discrete Opti- mization segmented by the qualified and non-qualified stu- dent groups. For clarity, states and transitions that were used by less than 1% of students are omitted from the di- agrams. Some of the key observations are: (1) Comparing across the qualified and non-qualified groups, we can see that the quantity of non-qualified students is greater than the qualified group. Hence, we have a very different insight into video viewing behavior when the qualified group is an- alyzed in isolation; (2) The transition behavior of the non- qualified group is remarkably similar across the two courses; and (3) When the qualified groups are compared across the two courses, it appears that these students switch between video topics in both courses more than non-qualified stu- dents, however, the switching behavior is more pronounced in Discrete Optimization.  In the next section we repeat this same analysis using students assignment submission as the key variable.  5.3 Assignment Submissions Transitions Comparing the assignment transitions between these courses  is particularly interesting because the rolling deadlines in Principles of Macroeconomics strongly constrain students to the structure of a linear curriculum, while the open curricu- lum structure of Discrete Optimization allows students to follow their own learning pathways, in their own time. Fig- ure 7 presents the assignment submission state transitions diagrams from both Principles of Macroeconomics and Dis- crete Optimization, again segmented by the qualified and non-qualified student groups. As before, the diagram ex- cludes states and transitions below 1% of the students. Some of the key observations are: (1) When qualified and non- qualified groups are compared, again we can see that the number of non-qualified students is far greater than qual- ified students. Once again, this allows for a very differ- ent insight into assignment submission behavior of students when the qualified group is analyzed in isolation; (2) The behavior of the non-qualified group of students is similar in the two courses. However, it is clear that a subgroup of non-qualified students in Macroeconomics prefer to skip the practice quizzes and only take the exams. This is evi- dent in the state transition diagram 7(a) where a population  2We considered both a week-based grouping and a topic- based grouping. The latter was more informative as key conceptual themes were covered over multiple weeks and any one week could cover at least two conceptual themes.  of approximately 100 students jump from Quiz 1, to Exam 1, then to Exam 2, and finally to Exam 3. In contrast, no students from the non-qualified group complete the as- signments in Discrete Optimization; (3) When comparing the two qualified groups across the courses, it is clear that students took great advantage of the open course structure in Discrete Optimization as evident by the number of for- ward and backward transitions between nodes. It seems that many students repeatedly revised their assessments over the 9 week course period.  Overall, both of these state transition analyses suggest that students took advantage of the open course structure provided by Discrete Optimization. The differences between the state transition diagrams of non-qualified and qualified groups of students, across video viewing and assessment sub- mission, for both courses, suggest the valuable insights that can be gained from isolating specific subgroups of students for analyses and visualizations using learning analytic data.  6. DISCUSSION The aim of this exploratory investigation was to develop  learning analytics techniques that could be applied to large data sets that emerge from students participation in MOOCs. Additionally, we sought to develop a greater understanding of patterns of students learning behavior across two distinct MOOCs through the use of different visual representation techniques. The starting point for this investigation was an acknowledgement that while mainstream MOOC providers are continually developing their learning analytics capacity, the current learning analytics output from these platforms is limited.  The findings from our investigation show the power of dif- ferent visualizations of learning analytics output. When the two courses were compared in terms of students interaction patterns it was somewhat surprising to see such similar pat- terns given the differences in each courses curriculum and assessment design (see Figures 2 and 4). For example, the cumulative distribution for students performance for Prin- ciples of Macroeconomics and Discrete Optimization were very similar. Moreover, when visualizations of patterns of engagement are differentiated by types of user (auditor, ac- tive, qualified), very similar patterns of activity across the two courses emerge, despite one having a linear curriculum design and the other employing an open curriculum design. While it may be assumed that different curriculum struc- tures engender different patterns of engagement, clearly for some variables and at particular levels of analysis, this is not the case.  The advantage of visualizing learning analytics output can also be seen in the use of state transition diagrams. This analysis and their visualization clearly showed how different types of users (qualified, non-qualified) show different pat- terns of transition between key MOOC resources (videos) and assessment activities. Our analyses provide new in- sights into how students engage with MOOCs and, more- over, suggest how different patterns of engagement impact on student performance. These types of analyses further our understanding of how different patterns of student en- gagement in MOOCs  and potentially other online learning environments  may lead to success. This has clear implica- tions for student retention and attrition in MOOCs, which is covered in more detail below.  The use of state transition diagrams also sheds light on  89    Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6  n = 15555 n = 7225  n = 3357 n = 1876 n = 1143  n = 747  (a) Principles of Macroeconomics, Non-Qualified  Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4  n = 12555 n = 3832  n = 1218 n = 1184  (b) Discrete Optimization, Non-Qualified  Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6  n = 2559 n = 2453 n = 2422 n = 1920 n = 1388 n = 1094  (c) Principles of Macroeconomics, Qualified  Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4  n = 2543 n = 2042 n = 1399 n = 997  (d) Discrete Optimization, Qualified  Figure 6: Student Video Viewing Transitions Broken Down by Subgroups, Non-Qualified (top) and Qualified (bottom) for Principles of Macroeconomics (left) and Discrete Optimization (right).  how differences in course curriculum and assessment design may impact on patterns of student engagement. This is most obviously seen by comparing the patterns of engagement of qualified students in Principles of Macroeconomics and Discrete Optimization. Students in Discrete Optimization clearly switched between assignments to a greater extent than students in Macroeconomics and also switched between videos provided in the course. Importantly, it seems that students in Discrete Optimization were more likely to go back to material they had already covered or viewed. While this is not surprising given the curriculum structure, it does indicate that by designing different curricula, and learning and assessment tasks in different ways, instructors have a strong influence on students learning activities and behav- iors [8]. These types of analyses and visualizations can also be very useful in informing curriculum redesign for future of- ferings of the course. If students are repeatedly viewing cer- tain videos this could indicate that the concept or principle being explained in the video may require further clarifica- tion or supporting resources. The visualization of students switching between concepts that are separated within a cur- riculum structure may also indicate where changes to the  flow of concepts within the curriculum are needed. A clear finding from this investigation was that the stu-  dent activity and success in the first couple of weeks of the course was significantly associated with students outcomes at the end of the course. The important role of prior knowl- edge in student learning has been thoroughly investigated by educational researchers and previous research has demon- strated that prior knowledge is linked to student success [6, 9]. Although we did not explicitly measure prior knowledge in this investigation, students performance on their first two (Discrete Optimization) or three (Macroeconomics) assess- ments was able to be used as a way to determine whether students had the necessary prior knowledge to accommodate the new, related information they covered in the course into their existing knowledge framework [17].  In practical terms, these findings highlight the potential value of providing students with informal diagnostic tests at the start of a MOOC. Such tests could be embedded within curriculum and could be used as early signals to both in- structors, and students themselves, about how well students are suited to the course material. This type of diagnostic test could be used to support automated adaptive learning tech-  90    Quiz 1 Quiz 2 Exam 1 Quiz 3 Exam 2 Quiz 4 Quiz 5 Exam 3  n = 3946 n = 555  n = 1226 n = 262  n = 701 n = 161 n = 115  n = 369  (a) Principles of Macroeconomics, Non-Qualified  Assignment 0 Assignment 1 Assignment 2 Assignment 3  n = 3694 n = 1166  n = 156 n = 66  (b) Discrete Optimization, Non-Qualified  Quiz 1 Quiz 2 Exam 1 Quiz 3 Exam 2 Quiz 4 Quiz 5 Exam 3  n = 3119 n = 3119 n = 2474 n = 1752 n = 1892 n = 1238 n = 969 n = 1232  (c) Principles of Macroeconomics, Qualified  Assignment 0 Assignment 1 Assignment 2 Assignment 3 Assignment 4 Assignment 5 Assignment 6  n = 2882 n = 2904 n = 1830 n = 1282 n = 916 n = 809 n = 741  (d) Discrete Optimization, Qualified  Figure 7: Student Assignment Submissions Transitions Broken Down by Subgroups, Non-Qualified (top) and Qualified (bottom) for Principles of Macroeconomics (left) and Discrete Optimization (right).  niques as well as more traditional forms of remediation and feedback. For example, if instructors and teaching assistants were able to view the patterns of engagement and the early student performance shown in Figure 4, this could be used as the basis for providing information and support to stu- dents. Strategies for real-time remediation in MOOCs could include highlighting common areas of misunderstanding in weekly student communications, launching new discussion threads to assist particular groups of students or targeting problem areas, and providing additional resources on topics requiring further explanation.  Identifying different student types based on their patterns of engagement also opens up the possibility of instructors tailoring specific feedback to particular sub-populations of students. For example, in the context of the current study, instructors may decide to tailor their feedback to those in the student audience who are active and qualified, rather than those who are auditors. If instructors know that a sig- nificant cohort of students are active in the course  they are watching videos and attempting assessments  but they are also likely to disengage from the course before its conclu- sion, they could design strategies to support these particular students.  There has been considerable commentary in the educa- tional community about the rate of student attrition in MOOCs. Much of the consternation comes from comparing students participation in traditional, often campus-based courses for which they often pay considerable fees, with students par- ticipation in free MOOCs that are delivered online. In many respects these are not fair comparisons as it is likely that students come to each type of course with different levels of motivation, expectations and degrees of commitment. This  notwithstanding, the findings from this paper provide an al- ternative way to calculate metrics of student retention in MOOCs. Rather than calculating these proportional com- pletion metrics on the basis of the number of students who expressed an interest in the course, or the number of stu- dents who logged on, it may be more informative to cal- culate retention metrics on the basis of those students who are deemed to have sufficient aptitude or prior knowledge to complete the course, as based on early diagnostic assess- ment. In the case of the latter, completion rates would be based on the number of students who have shown a baseline competency in the course material. While this may not be appropriate for some MOOCs that are of general interest, it might be an alternative and useful metric for more technical or professional courses. It is important to note that we are not advocating any type of restriction on open participation in MOOCs, rather that metrics of retention and attrition also be calculated on the basis of those students who are deemed to have sufficient prior knowledge to complete the course.  7. CONCLUSIONS The analyses and visualizations of learning analytics data  presented in this paper go some way to providing greater insights into student activity in MOOCs. However, there is still a great deal of research that can be done in this area. For example, the segmentation of students into auditors, active and qualified groups could be investigated further, across a range of MOOC contexts and disciplines. Also a more detailed analysis could be undertaken to understand the transitions students make from being active participants  91    to auditors. The analysis of the state transition diagrams in terms of performance in the course could also add to our knowledge of the patterns of behaviors in MOOCs that can contribute to success. Further research could also examine the concept of student motivation and the relationship this has to patterns of engagement and performance in MOOCs.  As noted at the start of this paper, in the last few years there has been considerable interest and hype about MOOCs generally, and the potential of collecting big data on learn- ers using these platforms. However, current MOOC plat- forms are limited in their ability to provide data feeds and vi- sualizations that can be easily used to assist instructors, ad- ministrators, designers and students in their decision mak- ing. In this paper we have demonstrated that with a rel- atively small amount of extra thought and analysis we are able to generate sophisticated visualizations and diagnostics associated with learning analytics data. While the creation of these visualizations is currently a post-hoc process applied to data extracted from one particular MOOC platform, the approach may be easily generalized to a live process on many other platforms. In fact, the true value of learning analytics to MOOCs  and to online learning more generally  will only be realized when MOOC and other platforms for vir- tual learning embed the kinds of analyses and visualizations presented in this paper for end users to routinely and easily access and use.  8.

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT  This paper introduces an approach to personalized learning [22]  that is rooted in situative views of cognition [3, 7], connectivist  views of learning [21], and participatory views of online culture  [18]. The features and learning analytics that define this approach  were first theorized and then refined informally and intuitively in  smaller online courses.  They were then scaled up to function  more systematically and automatically in a big open online  course (BOOC).

RESEARCH CONTEXT  This particular approach to personalized learning is rooted in prior  design-based studies of educational multimedia [14, 16],  educational videogames [1] and English language instruction [13].  This prior research resulted in a general set of design principles  and local theories [4] for enacting them.  Starring in 2008, these  ideas were used to design and refine two online graduate level  courses: Learning & Cognition in Schools and Assessment in  Education.  Both courses served students with very diverse  experiences & ambitions; both courses brought with them detailed  expectations for disciplinary content coverage.   These refinements resulted in a set of participatory design  principles for fostering productive forms of individual and social  engagement in disciplinary knowledge [5] while also consistently  impacting individual understanding (as assessed with classroom  performance assessments) and aggregated achievement (as  measured with conventional tests).  The courses were organized  around wikifolios that every learner could see and comment on.   Both courses were organized around texts that were challenging  for less-experienced learners. The first author taught each course  online at least once per year using the Sakai CMS. These features  and analytics (a) were reasonably efficient with up to 30 students,  (b) supported extensive levels of individual and shared  disciplinary engagement, (c) generated enduring understanding of  targeted course concepts, and (d) resulted in significant and  substantial gains in student achievement [15].     The Assessment course was scaled up to a 12-week open course  using Google Course Builder (Version 1.4) starting September  2013. The assignments, interactions, assessments and analytics  were all revised to be manageable with up to 500 participants.  Ultimately, 460 registered for the course, including 8 who also  enrolled for official university credit and agreed to complete all  optional assignments. Some participants held doctoral degrees in  education while others had no prior coursework in education.  In addition to preparing for the BOOC, more scaling took place  across the BOOC as the features and analytics were streamlined  and/or automated. Some streamlining involved making more  efficient use of the instructors time as the weekly analytics and  feedback were handed off to the teaching assistant (TA, the 2nd  author) and in some cases to an intern (the 3rd author). Other  streamlining involved moving from the cumbersome manual  examination of wikifolio pages to downloading spreadsheets to  automated algorithms.  Other scaling (not discussed here) is  continuing as entire features are redesigned (and sometimes re- conceptualized) to function more autonomously. Generally  speaking, the courses were designed and refined in order to align  immediate real-time feedback as individual wikifolios were   93         posted, close feedback across the entire set of wikifolios, proximal  reflections on wikifolios, and distal assessment of achievement  and post-hoc examinations of engagement.    3.  LEARNING FEATURES & ANALYTICS  Thirteen personalized learning features and analytics were scaled.   Each is described as it was first refined informally and intuitively  in the small course. The paper then describes how each was scaled  up in the BOOC and summarizes the associated engagement.   3.1 Define Personalized Learning Contexts.    Situative perspectives on cognition suggest that the context in  which learning occurs is equally as important as the disciplinary  knowledge that is learned [7, 10].  Thus a core participatory  design principle is that learners should define a personalized  context to anchor disciplinary learning.  Throughout the learning  experience, learners should revisit and refine their characterization  of their context, co-constructing knowledge of their experience  alongside the disciplinary knowledge of the course.  A more  specific principle focuses directly on aspects of disciplinary  knowledge that are contextual (take meaning from contexts of  use) and consequential (have consequences from practice); a  related assumption is that the discourse that follows readily will  generate factual, procedural, and conceptual knowledge.  In the  Assessment courses, learners first define a curricular aim that  represents a particular domain and their actual or aspirational role  in the educational system (teacher, administrator, researcher, etc.).  Ideally, personalization should reveal bottlenecks [19] that  impede learning.  In assessment, this is understanding the  distinction between practices of teaching and the processes of  learning.  The public individual feedback (described below)  provides contextualized guidance that is ideal for helping  newcomers appreciate this seemingly-nuanced distinction.  In the small class, students defined their personalized learning  contexts in their first graded wikifolio assignment. After  introducing themselves on their wikifolio home page, they added  a subpage where they defined their curricular aim and their  educational role, interests, and goals. They were instructed to refer  to a relevant section in the text, the instructors example, and  samples from previous semesters, and to refer to their classmates  examples and instructor feedback once the first few were posted.  BOOC participants defined their personalized contexts in two  stages. First, registrants were instructed to draft an initial  curricular aim and describe their role while registering.  This  introduced the personalized approach from the outset, and  presumably discouraged registrants who were not serious about  taking the course and/or disliked the approach. While 631  completed a pre-reregistration form that only required an email  address, 460 completed the registration, and 358 completed the  initial curricular aim. Eight participants paid full tuition for the  course in order to earn three graduate credits and were required to  complete all parts of all assignments. Registrants aim and role  were automatically inserted into the wikifolio for the first  assignment, which had them elaborate on the aim and role,  describe their goals, and locate a relevant educational standard.  Participants were encouraged to examine others work and  individual and social feedback (described below) was provided.   Each wikifolio assignment instructed participants to use their  expanding knowledge of assessment to further refine the  description of their context and curricular aim.  To emphasize this  aspect of learning, they were encouraged to return to this  introductory wikifolio element after completing the other parts.  Post-hoc analysis of the change of this element from one wikifolio   to the next revealed an average change of 140 words, with spikes  at the transition to Part Two and to Part Three   3.2 Assign Networking Groups  The formation of affinity groups around common interests is a  crucial aspect of participatory learning [6]. Interaction within and  between networking groups helps learners see how the  disciplinary knowledge of the course takes on different meaning  in different contexts.  In the small course, students were  intuitively assigned to groups using the information they provided  in the first assignment. Reassignments and group mergers were  handled informally and case-by-case. In the BOOC, assignment to  a larger number of larger groups was done systematically by  downloading the information provided at registration to a  spreadsheet. Participants were then assigned to the networking  groups by adding identifiers to their names and using that  information to sort the display of names on the participant page.   3.3.  Identify Secondary/Emergent Groups  As participatory learning unfolds, new cross-cutting groups  should emerge. In the small class, this was supported informally  as students got to know each other, and primarily concerned  academic domains.  Thus, mathematics teachers might seek out  administrators and researchers with interest with mathematics. In  the BOOC, the third assignment invited participants to revisit their  profiles and extend their name to add self-defined identifiers to  afford secondary groups and project more distinct identities. Fifty- nine percent of those who posted the third wikifolio did so. Most  extensions were disciplinary, and some resulted in new cross- cutting groups (e.g., mathematics) that fostered additional affinity.  A few non-disciplinary extensions (e.g., unemployed) seemed  to foster additional affinity without distracting.     3.4 Post Course Artifacts Publically  Meaningful artifacts are central to participatory learning [18].   Artifacts that are public and persistent play a crucial role in the  interest-driven social networks that provide much of the  inspiration for participatory learning [17]. This is the logic behind  the wikifolio assignments introduced above.  Students in the small  class viewed a streaming video on making wikifolios, accessed  guidelines for each, and posted a single continuous page. In the  BOOC, guidelines were contained in section headers that could be  shown or hidden in edit and view modes.  In edit mode a  WYSIWYG text-editing window appeared in each section.  This  design helped frame the wikifolios as stand-alone documents  (rather than class assignments). One new feature allowed  BOOC participants to choose to Save as Draft or Post for Review.  Another new feature posted a link next to each participants name  at the course homepage. This simplified the process of locating  classmates whose wikifolios were ready for review and  comments, and facilitated some of the other analytics.   3.5.  Rank Relative Relevance  The prior research confirmed that having learners rank targeted  elements of disciplinary knowledge in terms of relevance to their  particular context was a productive course feature. The  contextual and consequential interaction and discourse that it  affords lends itself nicely to disciplinary interaction among  students and instructors [15]. For example, sometimes students  appeared to rank an idea as least-relevant because they did not  understand its relationship to their context.  This was an inviting  context for others to point to unexplored relevance.   94         In the small course, students were instructed to summarize the  ideas in order of relevance and include rationale for the ordering.  In the BOOC, participants rearranged text boxes containing  summaries of the ideas (and sometimes links to additional  information) and provided a rationale in the text box below. This  simplified the process and generated data for social feedback.   3.6.  Accessing Personalized Content.   Consistent with connectivist views of learning [4], learners locate  new course content that is relevant to their personalized context.   In the small online course, some assignments instructed students  to (a) use search engines and a classwiki to search for outside  resources, (b) include links to those resources in their wikifolio,  and (c) add annotated links into the classwiki. Informal analytics  organized the classwiki, helped struggling students locate  resources, and provided individual and social feedback.  This was  all done informally and intuitively. This support was laborious  and limited by the instructors available time.  In the BOOC, this activity was introduced gradually. The  assignments in the first part of the course were completed using  the well-structured guidelines in the textbook.  The assignments in  the second part of the course had participants search for relevant  resources and post links to their wikifolio.  Assignments in the  third part had participants rank the relative relevance of a range of  provided resources and then search for new resources to share  with their peers. These new resources were automatically  compiled on a page where they could be readily located.   3.7.  Public Individualized Feedback  Most interaction in these courses occurs publically and  persistently within threaded comments at the bottom of each  wikifolio.  In the small course, the LMS notified the instructor  that the initial wikifolios are posted; the instructor immediately  provided relatively extensive feedback.  This included more  nuanced concepts that were too advanced to be included in the  assignment (where they would overwhelm the less experienced  students). The instructor immediately sent a message to the class  thanking those students for posting early and encouraging other  students to examine the examples and the feedback.  While this  practice was time-sensitive and time-consuming for the instructor,  comments from students around that feedback and in the  collaboration reflections (described below) confirmed that  students read and used the early feedback. A similar strategy was  employed in the BOOC, except that the TA helped identify the  best early posters from the larger number that posted on the first  day, and helped draft the more routine feedback, allowing the  instructor to focus on inserting the advanced ideas and opinions.     3.8. Peer Commenting and Discussion  While artifact comments anchor interaction to contexts, strategies  are needed to elevate illustrative interactions involving a few  learners (and instructors and TAs) so that they are apparent to all  learners. In the small class, each assignment instructed students to  post at least one question about their own wikifolio as a comment  to their peers and the instructor. Students were also instructed to  comment on three or more classmates wikifolios.  In addition  to the early feedback described above, the instructor was able to  informally track most of the conversation and highlight the most  productive interactions in weekly summaries. In the most recent  class, wikifolios attracted an average of six comments. Coding  revealed that 89% of the comments concerned educational  assessment and that 78% concerned the weeks assignment.   Significantly, 33% of comments made reference to context (either  the wiki author or the commenter and sometimes both).  Wikifolios received an average of 2.9 comments and the average  number was relatively constant across the course. Post hoc  analysis of one third of the wikifolios revealed that 65% included  an initial question and 55% of those questions got a response.  Coding of comments was streamlined by a subsystem that output  comment text and context, allowing faster examination of the  impact of new or modified assignment features on engagement.     3.9 Instructor and Peer Endorsement  Artifact-oriented education calls for some form of accountability  for the artifact quality and associated interactions.  Yet, even with  a highly structured rubric, it would be overwhelming to formally  grade such extensive artifacts and interactions.  More importantly,  doing so is likely to undermine the disciplinary engagement that  occurs when creating and discussing artifacts.  In the small course, a core innovation emerged around the notion  of consequential engagement [9]. Each wikifolio assignment  included three reflections to be completed a week after the  original deadline (presumably before beginning the next  wikifolio).  These included consequential engagement (what will  you do differently in your context as a consequence of learning  this knowledge), critical engagement (how suitable was your  context for learning this knowledge), and collaborative  engagement (who elses work and whose comments helped you  learn this knowledge).  Each wikifolio was awarded full points  (5 out of 100) as long as a complete draft was posted on time and  the reflections were coherent. Analyses of reflections in the small  class (and other contexts) confirmed that (a) it was difficult for  students to write coherent reflections without having (or getting) a  reasonable understanding of the targeted concepts and (b) the  public nature of the artifacts discouraged students from gaming  the system by reflecting on incomplete assignments [15].     This artifact accountability strategy was too laborious for the  BOOC.  In response, the reflections were deemed optional and  artifact accountability was accomplished via peer endorsement.   Once a wikifolio is posted, peers (but not the author) can click a  button to endorse it as Complete (required elements) or Complete  (including optional elements).  Participants were instructed to  endorse at least three wikifolios as part of their peer interaction.  There was no limit to the number of endorsements and the names  of each endorser were displayed on the wikifolio. Participants  whose wikifolios were complete but unendorsed were invited to  request TA endorsement if necessary.  The BOOC peer accountability strategy for artifacts was  remarkably successful. Wikifolios earned an average of 5.1  endorsements, increasing from 3.6 in the first week to 5.7 on the  last week.  Formal review of all endorsed wikifolios revealed that  just two percent were incomplete. The exception was the  instruction to post a question to peers, which perhaps one third of  the wikifolios lacked.    3.10. Peer Promotion  Another core participatory design principle is that disciplinary  engagement should be recognized and rewarded, but that should  occur outside any formal evaluation or accountability system.   This is because the summative function of formal evaluation  undermines engagement by encouraging students to game the  system and the community.  Students in the small course were  instructed to post one (and only one) stamp of approval each  week via a comment starting with a distinctive string (&&&) that   95         warranted their claim that the artifact, exchange, or comment was  exemplary. The wikifolio homepage indicated which student  earned the most such stamps each week.   In the BOOC, participants simply clicked a box to promote a  wikifolios, which then asked them to add a warrant. The names of  promoters and their warrants were then displayed on the wikifolio.  Participant in each group with most promotions each week were  acknowledged in the weekly feedback.  The group members with  the most promotions for each of the three units and for the entire  course were awarded leader versions of the digital badges  describe below. Participation in peer promotion averaged 67%,  increasing from 51% in the first week to 77% in in the last week.   3.11.  Weekly Individual & Social Feedback  As detailed above, much of the interaction each week considered  the relative relevance of that weeks ideas from the specific  perspective of individual peers and the more general perspective  of different groups.  Doing so prepared both individuals and  groups to learn more by seeing the eventual rankings of relevance  of those ideas for the various networking groups and revisiting  exemplary considerations of those relationships.  For example,  when learning about validity, that fact the teachers,  administrators, and researchers respectively found content  validity, criterion validity, and construct validity most relevant  clearly reified important (but initially nuanced) distinctions that  learners first encountered during the assignment. In the small  class, the instructor drafted a weekly summary while reviewing  and commenting on student assignments. This information and  links to good examples were then posted as an announcement.  The course evaluations confirmed that students liked this feedback  and enjoyed seeing themselves and classmates recognized.  But  the process was time-sensitive and time-consuming for the  instructor. Some students complained that the feedback arrived  too late and that the process was biased to reward early posters.  In the BOOC, all of the relevance rankings were accessed via a  spreadsheet, which supported additional tagging, coding, and  counting; examples were selected starting with the wikifolios that  received the most promotions.  While still requiring  approximately five hours per week, this was entirely managed by  the TA.     3.12   Appropriate Accountability  A situative focus on productive forms of disciplinary engagement  reframes traditional notions of assessment [6, 8, 11, 13].  This  treats classroom assessments as peculiar forms of disciplinary  discourse that are primarily useful for improving curriculum and  of little value for directly advancing knowledge; standards- oriented achievement tests become bizarre discourse that is  primarily useful for evaluating complete courses and seeing broad  improvement over time, but nearly useless for evaluating  individuals or directly advancing individual learning.  The small class took timed exams with both open-ended items and  multiple-choice items. The open-ended items were curriculum- oriented; each asked students to consider the relevance of a  randomly selected chapter implication to the small class context in  five minutes; the multiple choice items were randomly selected  from the textbook item bank and students were given two minutes  per item. Item-level feedback was only provided for the open- ended items and the midterm and final exams were worth just 30  of 100 points. Average scores have averaged around 90%.  Individual exam scores typically mirrored engagement and were  generally where weaker students ended up with lower grades.   Because of the workload, the open-ended items were dropped in  the BOOC, which included three 20-item unit exams and a 30- item comprehensive final.  While item-level feedback was not  provided, participants were allowed to take the exams twice in  three hours and take the final twice in four hours.   Participants  were required to complete the exams and final to earn digital  badges, but the original 80% criteria was relaxed.  Participants  were able to choose whether they included their exam  performance on their digital badges, and exam scores were  factored into final course grades for the for-credit students.  Average scores for non-credit participants were 84%, 76%, 78%,  and 75%, while average scores for the for-credit students were  88%, 83%, 78%, and 82%.     3.13.  Web-Enabled Digital Badges   In contrast to conventional credentials, open digital badges can  contain specific claims about learning and achievement, along  with detailed evidence (and links to additional evidence)  supporting those claims. Open badges can be readily accumulated  in external backpacks and shared over social networks. In the  most recent small class, the instructor experimented with  awarding open badges in order to prepare for the BOOC. The  badges were issued directly to the Mozilla backpack and  summarized the assignments the student had completed and  indicated that they had passed the exam.  In the BOOC, badges were automatically generated and could  contain details regarding the assignments completed, number of  comments, endorsements, promotions, and exam performance.   Significantly earners were able to select which evidence to be  included, and whether to include links to their completed  wikifolios (minus peer comments for privacy).  Participants could  earn one badges for each of three course parts; participants who  earned all three and completed the final exam were issued the  Assessment Expert badge. A Leader version of each of the four  badges was issued to the participant in each group who earned the  most promotions; a customizable Expert badge which displayed  the earners self-define area of assessment expertise was offered to  participants who turned their weekly wikifolios into a  comprehensive paper.  In the end of course survey, 41% of  completers reported sharing their badges, mostly via Facebook  and/or email.  While seven of the participants submitted a paper,  only four of the papers met the criteria for the custom badge.    4.  CONCLUSIONS  In light of the low completion and engagement rates reported for  university-sponsored MOOCs [2], the BOOC appeared quite  promising.  Of the 160 participants who completed the first  assignment, 60 (37%) completed the course.  In contrast to the  declining engagement among completers in most MOOC,  engagement levels across the BOOC units was stable (comments)  or increased (endorsements and promotions). BOOC completers  reported working an average of 7.5 hours per week, with a high of  30 hours.  Open-ended comments were overwhelmingly positive;  one participant who completed his MS and PhD at top-ranked  universities deemed the BOOC best graduate-level education  course he had ever taken. Reassuringly, there were virtually no  meltdowns like those at one widely cited failure to foster more  participatory personalized learning at a massive scale [25].  The success of this course supports four suggestions for scaling up  participatory learning.  The first suggestion is that scaling should  be done incrementally. With around 100 participants completing  weekly assignments, it is possible to gradually streamline the  learning analytics by handing them off to a TA and making use   96         spreadsheets and the other resources. With thousands of learners,  this useful iterative refinement and the insights that followed  would have been impossible. While this brief paper does not  allow elaboration, efforts are already underway to further  streamline most BOOC features and analytics to allow their use in  automated and/or massive contexts.  The second suggestion is that efforts to scale should consider  design-based research methods [4]. The specific effort described  here was part of a larger ongoing effort to refine and exemplify a  set of more general participatory design principles.  In translating  these more general principles into specific features and analytics,  more specific design principles are emerging alongside  knowledge of the contextual factors that help make them possible.  Together, these general principles, specific principles, specific  features, and contextual factors offer useful knowledge for  broader effort and the efforts of others  The third suggestion is that the design principles used to scale  participatory learning embrace emerging situative theories of  assessment. [8, 11, 12] This provides a coherent framework for  aligning informal assessment during activities, semi-formal  assessment in reflections, and formal assessment in exams.    The final suggestion is that the design and refinements of  interactive features and analytics focus on contextual and  consequential knowledge.  Doing so appears to be a scalable way  to foster the natural forms of disciplinary engagement [5] that that  can also foster learning of the factual, procedural, and conceptual  knowledge that courses are typically accountable for.   5.

The study identifies three research questions: a) How does activity evolve in these MOOCs? b) Are all learning activities relevant?, and c) Does the use of the target language influence?. We conclude that the MOOC activity drops not only due to the drop-outs. When students skips around 10% of the proposed activities, the percentage of passing the course decrease in a 25%.

We conclude that the MOOC activ- ity drops not only due to the drop-outs. When students skips around 10% of the proposed activities, the percentage of passing the course decrease in a 25%.

INTRODUCTION Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) give us the op-  portunity to collect unprecedented volumes of data on stu- dent interaction with learning systems as well as to study how the use of social media impacts on the learner [4]. How- ever, student participation in MOOCs is varied.

Drop-outs are one of the main concerns in MOOC studies [1].  This paper selected three of the research questions where the analysis of MOOC log data in the UNED platform pro- vided useful insights. Other research questions were dis- carded because was necessary to track more user interac- tions.  The remainder of this text is structured as follows: next section presents how the courses are structured in order to provide a better understanding of the dataset. Then, we present the results of the analysis. The paper ends with a summary of the conclusions and future work.  2. UNED COMA UNED COMA is the OpenMooc [2] platform of the Span-  ish National Distance Education University (UNED). Par- ticipants in UNED COMA have access to learning materi- als in the form of short videos recorded by teachers, self- assessment activities to check progress, and a forum where they can ask questions. Badges are automatically awarded to participants, recognising their progress and contributions to the learning community.  In addition to badges, two different types of accreditation are available, namely: a) credential: validation of having successfully finished the course and having passed an online test and b) UNED COMA certificate: in collaboration with UNED (after formal f2f test in a UNED centre).  The second week of October 2013, there were more than 141,000 unique registrations in the 21 courses available in the platform. So far, more than 5,000 UNED COMA certificates have been awarded.  In order to analyse the data in some detail, we focus on two of the language courses: Fundamentals of German for Spanish speakers and Professional English. The German and English language courses had 23065 and 33811 students, respectively. The German language course is for beginners and relied on peer review and questionnaires, and the En- glish language course is for advanced students with student progress assessed through questionnaires only. Around 5% of the students are likely to pass the language courses. These percentages are similar to other non language courses in the same platform.  98    3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS Drop-out rates and social interactions are two elements  often discussed in MOOC research [1, 3]. Below, we report on our analysis of these two aspects with the UNED COMA platform. In this section, we discuss three research ques- tions. Every research question contains hypotheses that we have explored through the use of visualisations.  Section 3.1 focuses on low completion ratios of MOOCs[1, 3], from two different points of view. We compare students who only access activities with students that also take as- sessments. We also compare the discussion forum activity of students who passed the course with the total students.  Section 3.1 results drive our research towards the explo- ration of how this activity is linked to the learning results. We know from previous studies that the lack use of fora has a relation with failure [9, 10], therefore Section 3.2 explores how activity within the platform may relate with those stu- dents who passed the course. Moreover, we also know that the use of the target language in language courses [8] can be relevant. Section 3.3 explores how the use of the language in the fora related to the students.  3.1 RQ1: how does activity evolve MOOC studies point out that the activity in forums drops  considerably as the course progresses [1]. We know from previous experiments [11] that there also is a drop in activity after the first week in blended learning courses.  In order to analyse this research question, we have created two visualisations per course (see Figure 1) and defined three hypotheses. The first chart visualises student access to the activities of each unit (blue bar chart) and student access to the assessments (red line chart). The second chart visualises the fora activity per day: in that diagram, the blue line represents the total student activity per day and the red line represents the activity in the fora considering only those students who eventually passed the course.  Hypothesis 1: Drops-outs occur at the beginning of the course.  Figure 1 shows that both courses share a characteristic: 75% of the students drop-out in the first three units of the course, so before the students reach the half of the course. Roughly, each unit loses 25% of students until unit 4, when the number of students becomes more or less stable.  Moreover, Figure 1 shows that the first activity of each unit is more visited than the rest of the activities of the same unit and more than the last activities of the previous units. Access to the activities decreases, but the first activity of each unit breaks this pattern. This can be due to many students accessing only the first activity of each unit, in order to explore course content.  Maybe, here lies a hidden opportunity to reduce the num- ber of drop-outs: MOOCs should pay attention to these first activities in each unit, in order to motivate and engage stu- dents.  Hypothesis 2: The drop activity in the fora is not due only to drop-outs.  As we reported at the beginning of this section, some stud- ies point out that the reduction of fora activity on fora or social media is due to drop-outs leaving the course [1]. Fig- ure 1 shows that for those students who passed the course (red line), the activity also decreases, following a pattern similar the blue line which includes the drop-outs. This ac- tivity drop is not so unusual, we already reported it in a case  study of a blended learning course [11]. Hypothesis 3: The percentage of students who pass the  course when they follow the course till the end is significantly higher.  Around 25% (3763 students) and 9% (2489 students) started the second activity of the last unit of the German and En- glish course (we exclude the first activity of the unit, because it breaks the patterns as reported before). So we may as- sume that these people remain in the course till the end. Considering only these students, the percentage of students who pass the course is up to 40% and 41%. Whilst these percentages are more acceptable than the initial ratios of 3% and 6%.  3.2 RQ2: Are all learning activities relevant Section 3.1 reports that among those students who re-  main active in the course untill the end, the success rate is around 40%. In this section, we analyse the data in order to find relevant metrics or common characteristics among those students who passed the course. For example, a study reported that higher social network activity does not im- ply better performance, however usually lower activity does imply worse performance [9].  Our hypotheses are: Hypothesis 1: There is a threshold on activities done.  Above this threshold, students are not more likely to pass the course.  In order to explore this hypothesis, we have visualised the percentage of students who passed the course based on the number of the learning activities that they did (see Figure 2).The first bin in the x-axis includes those students who did less than the total number of activities minus 50. The total number of activities are 130 activities for the English course and 110 activities for the German course. We chose total minus 50 activities as a low threshold because nobody in that bin passed any of the courses. The y-axis in Figure 2 represents the percentages of students who pass the course per bin represented in the x-axis. Consecutive bins increase by 10 activities, until the maximum number of activities in the course.  Figure 2 shows that students who did more course activ- ities had higher chances to pass the course. Therefore, we do not find the threshold hypothesised in hypothesis 1. The more learning activities a student does, the more likely the student will complete the course successfully. This evidence is also supported by statistical analysis when we perform the Spearmans rank correlation test to the individual activity per student. The test result is a significant positive correla- tion with p-value<0.001 and =0.32. Indeed, skipping only 10 of the course activities decreases the percentage drasti- cally decreased by 25 points. Therefore, doing all learning activities was a key factor to pass the course.  Hypothesis 2: There is a threshold on forum participation. Above this threshold, students are not more likely to pass the course.  In order to validate hypothesis 2, we have visualised the percentage of students who passed the course based on their fora activity (see Figure 3). We grouped the students in bins for students who have between 0 and 10 posts, between 10 and 20 posts, between 20 and 30 posts, or more than 30 posts (see x-axis in Figure 3). We then calculated the percentages of students who passed the course in each bin (see y-axis in Figure 3).  99    Figure 1: Absolute activity and filtered activity visualized along the course  100    Figure 2: Relation between learning activities and success  Figure 3: Relation between fora activity and success  Figure 3 shows that more activity in the fora correlates with higher likelihood of success. This evidence is also sup- ported by statistical analysis. The Spearmans rank corre- lation coefficient is significant with p-value<0.001 and  = 0.20. However, the increased success ratio flattens out quickly which confirms hypothesis 2.  Hypothesis 3: Active threads are key threads. If fora activity is a relevant metric for students who passed  the course, we considered the possibility that more active threads can have more impact on those students who passed the course.  In order to explore this hypothesis, we have visualised in Figure 4 the percentages of passed students per bin. These bins are based on the number of posts that each thread con- tains, therefore we build up bins from 0 to 10 posts, 10 to 20 post till the 140-150 bin (see x-axis in Figure 4). We then calculated the percentages of students who passed the course in each bin (see y-axis in Figure 4)  Figure 4 shows that most of the threads in the German course have a success rate around 50% and in the case of the English course around 30%.  However, Figure 4 shows that there is no apparent cor- relation between active threads and percentages of students who passed the courses. This evidence is also supported by statistical analysis. The Spearmans rank correlation coef- ficients shows a slightly negative correlation significant for both courses, with p-value<0.001 and  = 0.04 for the  Figure 4: Percentages of passed students per thread bins (English and German Course)  English course and p-value<0.001 and  = 0.09 for the German course. However, we see in Figure 4 that the last bins contain an unusual high percentage of students who passed the course compared with the previous bins. There- fore, we analysed manually the content of these threads. The last bin in the English course contains only a thread that students used to post solutions to the assignments. In a more fair play way, the last bin in the German course con- tained a thread which students posted external educational resources.  Therefore, neither Figure 4 nor the slightly negative cor- relation shows that active threads are a relevant metric to explore in our courses.  3.3 RQ3: Does the use of the target language in fora influence learning outcomes  The use of social network tools such forum, wiki and blogs has been widely researched in language courses [10]. The use of the course target language seems to have positive effects [8].  Hypothesis 1: The students who passed the course use more frequently the target language in the fora.  In order to explore this hypothesis, we have classified all the messages with the probability that they are written in the target language or Spanish using UClassify [5]. The x- axis in Figure 5 shows the probability of writing in the target language. The y-axis contains the normalised number of students. The red line represents the students who fail and the blue line is the students who pass the course.  We can discard the German chart in Figure 5 because a very low percentage of students use German in the fora. The blue line decreases just behind of the red line. Considering the raw data of the German course, only 1% of the users wrote in German with higher probability than 10%. 93% of users wrote in Spanish with higher probability than 90% . Almost, all the students used Spanish as the communication language in the fora.  Figure 5 shows that the target language was not used very often in the communications. We expected this in the Ger- man course because it is a course that does not require pre- vious knowledge. However it looks unusual in a Professional English course.  The evolution of the English course graph in Figure 5 is very similar for the students who pass the courses and those who fail. Therefore, we can say that the use of the target language in media is not correlated with the probability of passing the course.  101    Figure 5: Comparing success and failure in the En- glish and German language course when students use the target language  Considering the raw data of the English course, only 10% of the students wrote in English with higher probability than 90%, while 67% were likely to use Spanish with a probability higher than 90%. When we perform the Spearmans rank correlation test, we see that the coefficients are not strictly significant (p-value<0.05). When we focus on absolute val- ues, the results do not change much. Only 13% of the stu- dents who used english with a higher possibility than 60% passed the course.  4. CONCLUSIONS This paper describes an exploratory analysis of two MOOCs  in the UNED COMA platform. We have presented that the percentage of students who passed the course exclud- ing drop-outs is around 40%. Regarding the drop-outs, the study points out that 50% of the students drop out during the first two units. Furthermore, whilst drop-outs are one of the causes of the drop in the fora activity, this pattern is also present when we consider only those students who passed the course as well as in other non MOOCs experi- ments.  Participating in the learning activities and fora correlates with the probabilities of a students passing the course. Around 70% of the students that perform all the activities pass the course. This percentage decreases close to 25% when they only skip 10 learning activities. Moreover, our study shows that students who are above a threshold in fora activity do not gain any additional beneficial influence from extra ac- tivities  Finally, we have to highlight our surprise that our analysis points out that the use of the target languages does not influence the probability of passing these courses.  5.

INTRODUCTION Over the course of many years, the education field has  gone through several transformations. As new techniques for both teaching and assessing students emerge, universi- ties and other post-secondary institutions are expected to quickly adapt and begin to follow the new norms. Further, as the needs of our society shift, we often see increased de- mands for professionals in particular disciplines. Most re- cently, this phenomenon can be observed with respect to the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  While creating an environment that stimulates student en- rollment in these particular fields is a challenge in itself, pre- serving high retention rates can be a far more complicated task. As [41] highlights, our understanding of retention has considerably changed over time, and efforts to address the issue are ubiquitous in higher education today. Yet, despite the rapid growth of this subject over the last few years, there are clear indications that the complexities involved with helping a highly diverse array of students to succeed are far from being understood.  It is estimated that nearly half of the students that drop out of their respective programs do so within their first year in college [17]. Consequently, a clear focus has been directed towards early identification and diagnose of at-risk students, and a variety of studies using statistical methods, data min- ing and machine learning techniques can be found in recent literature (e.g., [14, 49, 9, 48, 32, 27, 26, 16, 50, 4, 42]).  A downside of these proposed models is that they fre- quently rely strictly on academic performance, demographic and financial aid data. There is a wide recognition, how- ever, that the reasons for student dropouts can range based on several other factors outside that scope [5, 35, 45, 20, 34, 31, 26]. Moreover, a number of dropout students do not ex- hibit any early signs of academic struggle as per their grades. The inverse is also true, as there are often highly engaged  103    students who despite performing below the expectations, re- main enrolled. Figure 1 illustrates these two specific groups of students.  Figure 1: Low performing/highly engaged students (quadrant I) are often retained. High perform- ing/disengaged students (quadrant IV) may drop out.  In this paper, we focus on remedying the shortcomings that arise when classification models are trained using only student academic performance and demographic data. We collected data that describe the access patterns of first-year engineering students to their personal electronic portfolios, which are dynamic web-based environments where students can list and describe their skills and achievements, and we show how these features correlate to and can help enhance the prediction accuracy of student attrition. In particular, we investigate how measurements of student engagement can be used to decrease miss-prediction rates of instances belong- ing to the groups highlighted in Figure 1.  The remaining portion of the paper is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 gives an overview of the most recent related literature. Section 3 describes the context in which this study was carried out and gives insights as to our decision to utilize electronic portfolios to measure student engage- ment. Following, section 4 describes our dataset in detail. The methodology and experimental results are covered in sections 5 and 6 respectively, and a brief discussion of our findings concludes this paper in section 7.  2. RELATED WORK From a sociological standpoint, student attrition has been  studied in great detail. Seidman [41] and Tinto [43] provide comprehensive studies that investigate the causes and con- sequences of this issue. Though related, this ramification of the literature is outside the scope of this paper. Following, we provide a more elaborate description of the most recent works that utilize student data to create and evaluate pre- diction models for student attrition.  Early work by DeBerard et al. [14] combined academic performance, demographics and self-reported survey data of  students in an attempt to forecast cumulative GPA using linear regression, and retention rates via logistic equations. The former achieved commendable results while the out- comes of the later were not statistically significant. Con- temporary to that, a study by Zhang et al. [49] showed that high school GPA and math SAT scores were positively correlated to graduation rates of engineering students, while verbal SAT scores correlated negatively with odds of grad- uation. Similar findings are reported by Mendez et al. [32].  A key premise of our work is highlighted by Burtner [9]. After monitoring a group of incoming engineering students over a three year period, the author concludes that while a predictive model based on cognitive variables such as the students math and science ability can perform relatively well, it would greatly benefit if non-cognitive factors devel- oped during the freshman year were to be incorporated. Lin et al. [27] validate that idea by showing that the accuracy of their classification models improves after the inclusion of non-cognitive features extracted from a survey.  Yu et al. [48] utilize decision trees to predict student retention, and among other discoveries, the authors report that in their context, student persistence was more closely related to the students residency status (in/out of state) and current living location (on/off campus) than it was to per- formance indicators. Likewise, a sensitivity analysis exercise performed on neural networks, decision trees, support vector machine and logistic regression models by Delen [16, 17] ul- timately concluded that several important features utilized to predict student retention were not related to academic performance.  With the intent of developing a long-term intervention sys- tem to enhance student retention, Zhang et al. [50] tested three different classifiers and observed that the best pre- diction accuracy for student retention was yield by naive Bayes. Alkhasawneh [4] utilizes neural networks to predict first year retention and provides an extensive analysis of his models performance. Finally, we highlight the recent work by Thammasiri et al. [42], in which the problem of predict- ing freshmen student attrition is approached from a class imbalance perspective, and the authors show how oversam- pling methods can enhance prediction accuracy.  3. CONTEXT  3.1 The College of Engineering The University of Notre Dame is a medium sized, Mid-  western, private institution with a traditional student com- position, i.e. the vast majority of students complete their undergraduate studies in four years and are in the age range of 18 - 22. The overall student body is 53% male and 47% female, while the College of Engineering is approximately 75% male and 25% female. First-year students are admit- ted to the First-Year of Studies program regardless of their intended future major. Students select their major (whether engineering or something else) near the end of their first-year when they register for classes for the upcoming fall semester. Beyond admission / selection into the university as a whole, there are no admission or selection criteria for entering any of the disciplines of engineering; rather, it is based on stu- dent interest alone.  With few exceptions, first-year students that are consid- ering an academic pathway within engineering complete a standard first-year curriculum, including the two-semester  104    course sequence of Introduction to Engineering, taught within the College of Engineering. Each year the course se- quence has enrollments of approximately 450 - 550 students. The course has two main objectives: 1) to expose students to the engineering profession and engineering major options, and 2) to demonstrate the processes of planning, modeling, designing, and executing specified project deliverables. The course curriculum uses a project based learning approach, with students completing a total of three group projects across the two semester sequence. Students are required to attend large lecture sections which introduce basic con- cepts needed to complete the projects and small group (30 - 35 students) learning centers that focus on hands on learn- ing. For over a decade, the course sequence has included similar material and project based course assignments, in- cluding: homework, quizzes, exams, technical reports and presentations.  3.2 ePortfolios for Engagement The ePortfolios serve as a creative space and a recording  system that utilizes digital technologies to allow learners to collect artifacts and examples of what students know and can do, in multiple media formats; using hypertext to organize and link evidence to appropriate outcomes/skills, goals, or standards [6]. ePortfolios capture and document students learning and engagement through their reflection, rationale building, and/or planning. Chen and Black [11] found ePort- folios generate shared responsibility and ownership of learn- ing between students and instructors since they can be used inside and outside the classroom. They are also available and can be used on and off campus, in face-to-face and vir- tual environments, and during and after the students time in college (as a way of practically demonstrating what ABET [1] refers to as life-long learning achievements). Atabi et al. [3] found the use of ePortfolios to be valuable as an ad- vising tool, allowing students to track the progress of their learning outcomes, to provide documentary evidence, and used when they meet regularly with their academic advisors for feedback. Significantly, the use of ePortfolios generates intentional and active learners since students become self- aware and take ownership of their academic progress.  Higher education institutions such as Bowling Green State University [23], La Guardia Community College [18], Uni- versity of Barcelona [29], Spelman College [37], Clemson [40], Penn State and Florida State Universities [47] have begun to implement ePortfolio initiatives to enhance en- gagement and measure impact through integrating life-wide academic, personal, and professional contexts. Student en- gagement is a construct that measures the alignment be- tween what effective institutions purposefully do (a range of teaching practices and programmatic interventions) to in- duce and channel students to desired outcomes, compared with what students actually do with their time and energy towards achieving these educationally purposeful activities [24].  The ePortfolio platform of our choice is supported by Dig- ication [2] and its Assessment Management System (AMS). The Digication paid subscription account not only offers an ePortfolio platform but also provides a powerful back- end course, program, institution, or inter-institution (AMS). Within individual, and across our partnering, institutions, the AMS tracks, compares, and generates customizable re- ports on student progress and performance by standards,  goals, objectives, or assignments.  3.3 ePortfolio Engagement as an Analytic For too long much of the emphasis on improving reten-  tion has focused solely on the binary metric of retention (yes/no). By focusing on student engagement rather than just predictive variables, after-the-fact outcome of retention or a subjective measurement of learning, the ePortfolio pro- vides a window into the time, energy level, and commitment exhibited by students throughout the trajectory of a given course. The assessment focus on retention is too late to interdict and improve learning within a course, especially during the first semester of college.  An ePortfolio engagement analytic has important impli- cations to the emerging field of learning analytics. Johnson et al. [22] define learning analytics as the interpretation of a wide range of data produced by and gathered on behalf of students in order to assess academic progress, predict future performance, and spot potential issues. The goal of learning analytics is to enable educators to understand and optimize learning via an environment tailored to each students level of need and ability in close-to-real time. Up until now, most of the data sources have been limited to learners tacit dig- ital actions inside the learning management systems (i.e., discussion forum posts, downloading content to read, login rates, and duration). The ePortfolio tool and platform offers a more authentic environment that could provide a week- by-week measure to identify if and when students are losing engagement and explore why, where, and what is engaging students as well as how they spend their time and energy outside of the class. Therefore, data mining the ePortfolios could generate more effective learning analytics to improve the understanding of teaching and learning, and to tailor education to individual students more effectively.  3.4 ePortfolio Use in the First-Year Engineer- ing Course  In the 2012 - 2013 academic year, ePortfolio assignments were integrated with the traditional course deliverables as a means to guide students reflections on their education. A total of eleven ePortfolio updates were assigned throughout the academic year. For the course, all students were required to create an ePortfolio following an instructor designed tem- plate. The ePortfolio template included three main sections, which were each updated over the course sequence:  1. Engineering Advising  Required reflection on their engineering major choice and their progress towards engineering skill areas. Seven skills areas were de- fined, each relating to ABET accreditation required outcomes (a - k).  2. Project Updates  Required updates following the com- pletion of each project. Minimally, students were asked to include a picture of their project and a reflection on skills developed through the project.  3. Engineering Exploration  Required reflections after attendance at eight engineering related events that took place outside of the course. Events included semi- nars, engineering student group meetings, professional development activities, etc. that were delivered by var- ious groups within the university.  105    Figure 2: The effect of ePortfolio engagement on first semester retention  Although ePortfolio assignments were a required portion of the course, they were graded largely for completion. There- fore, student effort towards their ePortfolio assignments had wide variability. In addition, students were encouraged to personalize their ePortfolios to include additional pages and information not required by the course. Because students were asked to share this ePortfolio with their advisors af- ter matriculating into engineering departments, they were encouraged to keep any additional content professional in nature.  Given this particular context of how ePortfolios are uti- lized, we believe that an important correlation between the students engagement using this tool and retention levels exists and can be potentially mined for predictive analysis. While section 4 will provide more details on our datasets and describe each of the features we analyze, a preliminary case study illustrated by Figure 2 showed that a select group of students who were more exposed to electronic portfolios as part of an enhanced academic program exhibited markedly higher levels of engagement using that tool, and more im- portantly, was retained in its entirety.  The particular group highlighted was composed of 12 stu- dents from underrepresented groups that were selected prior to the fall semester to be part of an academic development program which, among other components, exposed them more extensively to the use of ePortfolios. In addition to maintaining an ePortfolio as part of their Introduction to Engineering class requirements, these students also enrolled a seminar course that made use of the tool. Note, however, that all data collected refers only to the their Introduction to Engineering portfolio. Even so, this group appears no- ticeably more interactive and engaged than the remaining portion of the students. As Figure 2 shows, they not only exhibited much higher levels of interactivity to their ePortfo- lios based on all three metrics, but also displayed a retention rate of 100%.  4. DATASET This study used data collected from a single cohort of  incoming freshmen students who were registered in a first semester Introduction to Engineering course. This particu- lar group was made up of 429 students, the vast majority of which had engineering majors listed as their first year intent and remained in the program for the subsequent semester,  leading to a very imbalanced dataset. While majors are not formally declared until their sophomore year, students are asked to inform their intended majors when submitting their application package and prior to their first semester on campus.  4.1 Description A variety of features that describe each students academic  performance, engagement and demographic background were made available to this project from multiple sources. These were then matched student-wise and merged into a single dataset. After an initial analysis of the data, we decided to exclude a number of features that either (1) had no appar- ent correlation to the outcome variable, (2) directly implied it, or (3) provided redundant information. Further, we also removed 10 instances that had a very considerable amount of missing data. These particular instances corresponded to students that dropped out early in the semester and hence had no academic performance or engagement data available. Table 1 lists and describes each feature available in our fi- nal dataset and Table 2 groups these into their respective categories.  It is worth noting that this particular dataset has a highly imbalanced class distribution wherein only 11.5% of the in- stances belong to the minority class (student dropped out). As described in [42], predicting student retention becomes more challenging when the available training sets are im- balanced because standard classification algorithms usually have a bias towards the majority class. While a wide range of sampling techniques can be used to artificially balance datasets of this kind (e.g., SMOTE [10]), we reserve those optimizations as future work.  4.2 Feature selection As a second step to preparing our dataset, we carried out  a series of tests to investigate how strongly correlated to the outcome each feature was. In general, performing feature selection as a means for reducing the feature space provides some benefits when building classification models. Namely, the model becomes more generalizable and less prone to overfitting, more computationally efficient and easier to in- terpret.  The following feature selection methods were used: in- formation gain (IG) [38], gain ratio (GR) [39], chi-squared (CS) and Pearsons correlation (CR). The first evaluates the worth of each attribute by measuring its information gain with respect to the class. Gain ratio works in a similar  106    Name Type Description Adm Intent Nominal Intended college major as specified by the student in his/her application package Adm Type Nominal Type of admission earned by student (e.g., early, regular, waiting list) AP Credits Numeric Number of credits earned through AP courses taken prior to college enrollment Dormitory Nominal Name of dorm where the student resides (note: all first-year students are required to live on campus)  EG 111 Grade Nominal Letter grade obtained in the introduction to engineering course ePort Hits Numeric Hit count for the students ePortfolio pages during the fall semester  ePort Logins Numeric Number of times the student logged in to his/her ePortfolio account during the fall semester ePort Subm Numeric Number of assignment submitted via ePortfolio during the fall semester Ethnicity Nominal The students self-declared ethnicity First Gen Binary A flag to denote first-generation college students FY Intent Nominal Intended college major as specified immediately prior to the beginning of the fall semester Gender Binary The students gender  Income Group Numeric A numeric value ranging from 1-21, each corresponding to a different income group segment SAT Comb Numeric Combined SAT scores SAT Math Numeric SAT score for the math portion of the test SAT Verbal Numeric SAT score for the verbal portion of the test Sem 1 GPA Numeric The students overall GPA at the end of the fall semester Retained Binary A flag identifying students that dropped out immediately after the fall semester  Table 1: Dataset features described  Type Subtype Feature  Academic Pre-Adm  Adm Intent SAT Math SAT Verbal SAT Comb AP Credits  Post-Adm  FY Intent EG 111 Grade Sem 1 GPA  Retained  Demographics -  Adm Type Gender  Ethnicity Income Group  First Gen Dormitory  Engagement - ePort Logins ePort Subm ePort Hits  Table 2: Dataset features categorized  manner while adopting a different metric. CS and CR com- pute chi-squared and Pearsons correlation statistics for each feature/class combination.  The results of our experiments are summarized in Table 3, where the top 10 features ranked by each method are listed, and the highest correlated one is highlighted for each column.  Several interesting observations can be derived from these results. First, we emphasize that all but one method re- ported ePort Hits as being the most important feature of the dataset. In other words, there appears to be a strong correlation between the number of times a certain students electronic portfolio pages are visited and that students de- cision to stay or withdraw from the College of Engineering. Note that these hits originate from both external visitors and the students themselves. While the current data does not allow us to discern the two scenarios, we suspect that the majority of the hits do in fact come from the portfolio  IG GR CS CR  Adm Intent 2 4 2 - SAT Math 7 2 5 3 SAT Verbal - - - - SAT Comb 9 10 9 - AP Credits 8 8 8 8 FY Intent 5 7 6 9 EG 111 Grade 4 5 3 6 Sem 1 GPA - - - 1 Adm Type - - - - Gender 10 9 10 5 Ethnicity - - - - Income Group - - - 7 First Gen - - - - Dormitory 3 6 4 - ePort Logins 6 3 7 4 ePort Subm - - - 10 ePort Hits 1 1 1 2  Table 3: Feature selection rank  owner. If that is indeed the case, this noticeable correla- tion could be explained simply by the fact that students whose portfolios exhibit larger number of hits are likely to be those who spend more time editing their pages, creat- ing new content, and submitting assignments (as those ac- tions directly contribute to that students page hit count). It would then make reasonable sense that this display of en- gagement should, in some cases, correlate with the chances of this particular student being retained.  Further, we noticed that some of the features had no sub- stantial individual correlation to the class values. For in- stance, in our particular context, ethnicity, admission type, first generation status, income, and the number of assign- ments a student sent through his/her ePortfolio did not ap- pear to be closely related with that students retention in the program. As reported by [49, 32], we also observed minor negative correlations between verbal SAT scores and engi- neering student retention.  So as to effectively compare the performance of classifica- tion models based on traditional academic data to that of  107    models based on student engagement features, we created four subsets from the original data. These are described bellow:   all-academic: This subset contained all academic and demographics features listed in Table 2.   top-academic: Following the feature selection pro- cess described above, this subset contains only the top three academic and demographics features. Multiple wrapper methods (i.e., which can score feature subsets rather than individual features alone) were used, and the final subset chosen contained the following: admin intent, EG 111 grade, and sem 1 GPA.   all-engagement: Contained the three ePortfolio en- gagement features.   top-academic+engagement: This final subset con- tained the optimal three-element combination of fea- tures across all initially available. These were: EG 111 grade, ePort logins, and ePort hits.  5. METHODOLOGY For this study, we selected a range of classification meth-  ods that have been previously utilized in this particular do- main, or that are suitable to work with imbalanced datasets. Following is a brief description of each classifier and the eval- uation measurements we use to compare their performance.  5.1 Classification methods  5.1.1 Naive Bayes Among the simplest and most primitive classification algo-  rithms, this probabilistic method is based on the Bayes The- orem [7] and strong underlying independence assumptions. That is, each feature is assumed to contribute independently to the class outcome. In predicting student attrition, naive Bayes classifiers have been used by [36, 50, 33]. Notably, the best results reported in [50] were achieved via this method.  5.1.2 C4.5 Decision trees Another very popular classification method, C4.5 decision  trees [39] have been used to predict student retention mul- tiple times in recent literature (e.g., [46, 33, 25, 28]). This method works by building a tree structure where split op- erations are performed on each node based on information gain values for each feature of the dataset and the respective class. At each level, the attribute with highest information gain is chosen as the basis for the split criterion.  5.1.3 Logistic regression Logistic regression is often used as a classification method  wherein a sigmoid function is estimated based on the train- ing data, and used to partition the input space into two class specific regions. Given this division, new instances can be easily verified to belong to one of the two classes. This approach has been used to predict student retention in [30, 19, 25, 27, 49, 21, 44], and it often achieved highly accurate results.  5.1.4 Hellinger distance decision trees When applying learning algorithms to imbalanced datasets,  one often needs to supplement the process with some form of  data sampling technique. Hellinger distance decision trees [12] were proposed as a simpler alternative to that. This method uses Hellinger distance as the splitting criterion for the tree, which has several advantages over traditional met- rics such as gain ratio in the context of imbalanced data. To the best of our knowledge, this method has not yet been used to predict student retention, but given that our dataset is highly imbalanced, we chose to investigate its performance.  5.1.5 Random forests Random forests [8] combine multiple tree predictors in an  ensemble. New instances being classified are pushed down the trees, and each tree reports a classification. The for- est then decides which label to assign to this new instance based on the aggregate number of votes given by the set of trees. Recent work by Mendez et al.[32] used this method to predict science and engineering student persistence.  5.2 Evaluation measures In order to compare the results obtained by each of the  classifiers as well as the four different data subsets, we uti- lize a variety of measures. A very popular standard used to evaluate classifiers is the predictive accuracy. Note, how- ever, that utilizing this metric to evaluate classification that is based on imbalanced datasets can be extremely mislead- ing.  To illustrate this issue, suppose that upon being given our dataset, an imaginary classifier predicts that all students will be retained in the engineering program following their first semester enrolled on campus. This will result in a remark- able 88.5% accuracy (recall that only 11.5 % of the students in this dataset dropped out). It is obvious, however, that such a classifier should not be awarded any merit since it fails to identify all students that should have been labeled as being at risk.  Instead, it is more appropriate to analyze the prediction accuracy for each individual class, or to use ROC curves to summarize the classifier performance. These and other measures can be calculated using confusion matrices (see Figure 3).  Figure 3: Confusion matrix for our experiments  Given the binary nature of this specific classification prob- lem, the corresponding confusion matrix reports four values: True Positives (TP)  the number of retained students cor- rectly classified, True Negatives (TN)  the number of drop- out students accurately classified as such, False Positives  108    (FP)  The number of drop-out students mistakenly classi- fied as retained, and False Negatives (FN)  retained stu- dents that were wrongfully predicted as drop-outs. Based on these labels, the individual accuracies for the negative (drop-out) and positive2 (retained) classes, as well as the classifiers recall rates can be obtained as follows:  accuracy = TN  TN + FN  accuracy+ = TP  TP + FP  recall = TP  TP + FN  As previously mentioned, ROC curves are frequently used to summarize the performance of classifiers on imbalanced datasets. On an ROC curve, the X-axis represents the FP rate FP/(TN + FP ), and the Y-axis denotes the TP rate given by TP/(TP +FN) at various threshold settings. The area under the ROC curve, AUROC, is also an useful metric for comparing different classifiers. The values for AUROC range from a low of 0 to a high of 1, which would represent an optimal classifier as highlighted in Figure 4.  Figure 4: ROC curve illustration  Note that one shortcoming of ROC curves is that they do not explicitly show any dependence with respect to the ratio of positive and negative class instances in the dataset. A similar curve that uses precision and recall rates (Precision- Recall curve) can mitigate that issue [13].  6. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To estimate how well the models generalize to future datasets,  we utilized a 10-fold cross validation technique. This con- sists on splitting the original n data instances into 10 com- plementary subsets of size n/10, each of which preserving the original ratio of minority and majority class instances. The classifier is then given 9 of the subsets for training, and validation is performed using the remaining portion of the  2The prediction accuracy for the positive class can also be labeled precision  data. This process is repeated for 10 rounds using different partitions at each time, and an overall average of the results across each iteration is computed.  The performance of each of the five classification methods described in section 5.1 was evaluated as they were used to perform prediction on each of the four available datasets. Table 4 displays the results of each individual experiment in terms of the prediction accuracy for the negative class instances (i.e., the ratio of dropout students that were cor- rectly labeled as dropouts), the prediction accuracy for the positive class instances (i.e., the ratio of retained students correctly classified as retained), and the overall weighted av- erage across these two accuracy measurements. The highest accuracies achieved for each of the datasets are highlighted in bold, while the three highest overall are underlined.

Given our binary clas- sification problem, two types of error could emerge. Stu- dents that ultimately remain in the program for the spring semester could be misclassified as dropouts (false negatives), and actual dropout students could be mistakenly labeled as retained (false positives). While some previous work (e.g., [15]) considered the first type of error to be more serious, we argue that the opposite is true. If these techniques are to be used in the development of an effective early warning system, failing to identify students that are at risk of drop- ping out can be much more costly than incorrectly labeling  109    someone as a dropout. In Table 4 we can see that predictions based only on aca-  demic performance and demographic data achieve a maxi- mum acc- of 27.5% when the all-academic dataset is paired with a naive Bayes model. That corresponds to only 11 of the 48 dropout students being correctly identified. Con- versely, when engagement features are utilized, that accu- racy improves very noticeably to 83.3% and 87.5%, both also achieved with the previously mentioned classifier.  The naive Bayes model using the top-academic+engagement dataset remarkably identifies 42 of the 48 dropout students. The vast majority of those retained (331 out of 419) are also correctly classified. Note that the other four classifiers obtain higher acc+ values under the same setup, and could potentially be the preferred choice depending on the circum- stances.  With respect to acc-, the naive Bayes classifier outper- formed the others for all but one dataset. We used its ex- perimental results in Figure 5 to illustrate the ROC and Precision-Recall curves for each dataset. In our particu- lar context, it seems apparent that the ePortfolio engage- ment features are very good predictors for student reten- tion. The highest AUROC value (0.929) was obtained by the top-academic+engagement dataset, while all-academic performed worse with an AUROC of 0.654.  7. CONCLUSION In this paper we investigated the feasibility of using elec-  tronic portfolio data as a means for predicting college reten- tion. We showed that while datasets that do not contain features describing student academic engagement can often yield reasonable results, providing such features to the clas- sification models greatly increases their ability to identify students that may ultimately drop out. Our experiments showed significant gains in accuracy when engagement fea- tures were utilized, and we believe this can be used to build early warning systems that would be able to identify at-risk students at very early stages of their academic life, giving educators the opportunity to intervene in a more timely and effective fashion.

INTRODUCTION  Many technological innovations are specified, developed, piloted,  and honed through partnerships with user communities who have  expressed interest in adding an innovation into their existing  workflow [1]. When learning technology innovations are  introduced to a new audience, the affordances of those  innovations may be understandably unclear at first, leading to  unintended uses of the innovation [2]. In fact, the innovation may  disrupt existing practices while new users learn to adapt new tools  into their workflow [3]. This process of appropriation [4] can  occur even if the new user community has expressed interest in  the tool.      One way to understand appropriation is by leveraging the  Technology Acceptance Model [5], which states that the two  factors that determine whether or not a piece of technology is  actually used are 1) the perceived usefulness of it, and 2) its  perceived ease of use. These two perceptions necessarily differ by  user, and also differ by collections of users groups (e.g., advisors,  teachers, etc.) who are considering adopting a new piece of  technology together. Since the users perceptions and experiences  ultimately determine the uptake of a technology within any given  community, it is imperative that designers introduce technology  innovations to new users carefully, while allowing room for  unintended uses of that technology; ideally, this will, encourage  successful adoption.    Learning analytics tools are especially susceptible to pushback  and unintended uses from new users because they are very new  and not well understood by those outside of the learning analytics  community [6]. As developers of these learning analytics tools,  we feel obligated to confront these challenges, particularly if the  rich and massive data sets are to be generalizable and actionable  for a broad set of educational audiences.   Our approach to building a learning analytics tool has been to  work closely with the target audience and help them during the  implementation process. We have previously reported on our  initial design of Student Explorer, an Early Warning System  (EWS) intended to support just-in-time decision-making around  students' academic performance for use by academic advisors  within two specific Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Mathematics (STEM) learning communities [7], as well as lessons  learned when scaling Student Explorer to support automated data  extraction and transformation processes within an online  environment [8]. The STEM advisors' use of Student Explorer in  these targeted learning communities has been shown to be  positively related to improvements in students' overall grade point  average (GPA) [9]. While each iteration of Student Explorer was  designed with input from academic advisors, they still had to learn  how to incorporate the EWS into their work routinesmaking  decisions based on their perceptions of the system and their  overall intrinsic motivation to use a new technology in the process  [10].   In this paper we report on the expansion of Student Explorer to a  new learning community; this deployment incorporated new data  sources and focused on academic advisors in a program designed  to help non-traditional students transition from high school to  college. Specifically, we rebuilt the system to extract and  incorporate quantitative and qualitative data that had been   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

We present our findings on how the new academic advisor user  group perceived and used Student Explorer over the course of a 7- week intensive summer term. Our findings suggest that learning  analytics interventions implemented in an advising context will  likely be viewed by studentsregardless of whether or not the  intervention was designed with guided student use in mind. We  believe these findings can inform the development of future  learning analytics interventions designed to support intermediary  audiences like academic advisors.   2. BACKGROUND  2.1 STEM Advisors: Student Explorer's First  Users  Student Explorer was initially designed to track student effort and  performance, and to provide support for the advisors in an  integrated student development program for at-risk students who  were in their first- and second-year in undergraduate STEM  programs [7]. The goal was to provide the necessary information  about student engagement and performance to advisors to  facilitate timely interventions with their students during the  semester. Students weekly updates were presented through  dashboards that provided interpretable presentations of data that  allowed the advisors to readily identify students who were in need  of immediate support.  For any given course students were  designated with an E3 status of Encourage (green), Explore  (yellow), or Engage (red). These designations served to quickly  distinguish between students who were succeeding in any given  course, students beginning to show signs of falling behind, or  students struggling with their coursework, respectively. Our long- term goal with Student Explorer is to scale its functionality  broadly so that the  feedback loops  between learners, teachers,  and academic advisors can be reduced in time and effort [10].   When we interviewed the STEM advisors about their use of  Student Explorer, they stated that their primary goal for using the  tool was to provide timely prescriptive guidance for students.  In  addition to discussions about grades, prescriptive advising tasks  can include assistance with course selection, schedule planning  and registration, referrals to other student support services,  explanation of degree requirements and review of students status  in relation to them [11]. Juxtaposed to this pragmatic prescriptive  guidance are developmental advising topics that include students  personal problems, self-esteem, interpersonal skills, and study  skills, student values, beliefs, and attitudes and the conflicts  between them [12, 13]. While recent advising research [14]  indicates that advisors frequently switch between prescriptive and  developmental approaches depending on the students' specific  situation, the use cases that defined the initial development of  Student Explorer were squarely in the prescriptive frame.   3. METHODS  Our design-based research project is a collaborative effort  between the researchers and the new group of academic advisors  who are our target users [15]. Design-based research involves a  series of approaches, with the intent of producing new theories,  artifacts, and practices that account for and potentially impact  learning and teaching in naturalistic settings [16, p. 2]. By  developing and deploying Student Explorer across multiple  contexts, our primary objective has been to ensure that our target  users are able to assist in Student Explorers development. We  continued to include advisors in our practice of iterative design in   order to increase the likelihood of producing a tool that is nimble  enough to be used in numerous academic advising contexts.    3.1 Setting  The Summer Bridge Program (referred to simply as Bridge, by  both advisors and students) began in 1975 as an effort to assist  nontraditional students' transition from high school to college by  providing highly structured introductory coursework. Today,  Bridge offers intensive academic preparation, individualized  academic advising, and a community-building living environment  to an incoming cohort of hundreds of students. Students are  expected to attend all of their classes and additional workshops,  while also meeting with their academic advisor on a regular basis.    Bridge students are enrolled in three courses: a mathematics  course (intermediate algebra or mathematical reasoning), an  English or Writing course, and a freshman introduction to social  science seminar. Of these, both advisors and Bridge leadership  have stated that the mathematics courses are the most  high  stakes  because they are designed to the specifications of the math  department, including grading students on a curve.   Since Bridge is only seven weeks long, it is very important that  academic advisors maintain awareness of students' progress,  particularly in the strictly-curved mathematics courses. In the past,  advisors periodically communicated with instructors via email to  discuss student progress, and they also received mid-term  progress reports from the instructors for any student who was  struggling academically. This proved to be too infrequent,  however, so the Bridge leadership team sought to utilize Student  Explorer to increase the frequency of feedback between  instructors and advisors.    3.2 Participants  Nine academic advisors (5 female, 4 male) served the 219 Bridge  students. These are experienced advisors who also serve nearly  2,500 students during the fall and winter terms. Seven of the  advisors have Masters degrees in educational leadership,  engineering, guidance and counseling, student affairs, and  psychology and two advisors have Doctoral degrees in higher  education student development and higher educational leadership.    3.3 Data Sources  Over the course of Bridge we collected data on advisors use of  the system as well as their attitudes towards Student Explorer  from three sources:    1) User log data was captured from academic advisors' use of  Student Explorer, capturing specific user actions (e.g.,  viewing the summary page for a student), the corresponding  date and time, the selected student ID, and the advisor's user  ID.    2) Log data aggregated from a calendar application used to  schedule advisors meetings. Data collected included the  time their appointments occurred with students, which  students they met with, and whether a student failed to show  for the meetings.   3) A pre-Bridge survey (16 items) asked advisors about their  background, perceptions of student academic orientation, and  general technology use. A post-Bridge survey (16 items)  asked advisors about the frequency of advising topics and  overall perceptions of Student Explorer's functionality.   3.4 System Features  As part of our expanded design experiment with the Bridge  leadership and advisors, several user interface and technical   114    enhancements were made. Below is a list of current features and  an explanation of them.     Figure 1. Student Explorer Student Summary (Top) and   Student Class Detail Screens (Bottom)  The four major features of the Student Explorer summary screen  (Figure 1, top) are:   A)  Alerts  boxes hat indicate which students, and for how   many current courses, are categorized in each E3 status.  B) A graphical display of the most recent students' and class   average percentage of total available points for all courses.   C) A checkbox that toggles the full summary view: a vertical   listing of the students' percentage of available points and  corresponding E3 value per week.   D) The most current student and class percentage of total  available points and corresponding E3 value. Users click on a  course listing in feature D to proceed to the student class  detail pop-up screen.   The four major features of the Student Explorer class detail screen  (Figure 1, bottom) are:   E) Graph of the students percentage points earned vs. class   average over time.  F) Graph of the students weekly LMS site visits percentile.  G) A listing of the students individual course assignments and   performance.  H) A mouse-over view of the text of qualitative gradebook   comments for a particular course assignment.    3.5 Implementation  Before the beginning of the term, Bridge advisors attended a 1- hour training session. The goals of this session were to introduce  Student Explorer to each advisor while also collecting feedback  that our programmer would use to make any necessary changes  before the Bridge students arrived and the system went live.    4. RESULTS  4.1 Pre-Bridge Survey   To determine which courses advisors anticipated discussing most  often during meetings with students, advisors were asked: Please  rank the following courses by how often you think you will raise  issues related to them. Results indicated that the majority of  advisors (4) ranked math first, while the orientation course   (CSP) and English were ranked first twice and once,  respectively.    Advisors also rated their agreement with the following  statements: I think [using Student Explorer] will be a valuable  use of my time (before/during/after) meetings with students  using a 1-5 Likert scale from Strongly Disagree-Strongly Agree.  Results indicate that, on average, advisors perceived Student  Explorer as a valuable tool regardless of their usage.   4.2 Student Explorer Use During Bridge  Usage data generated by Student Explorer was collected for each  advisor throughout the seven weeks that Bridge took place. We  also mined data from advisors calendar files, which allowed us to  compare when Student Explorer use coincided with scheduled  meetings with each student. Due to the relatively small number of  advisors (N = 9), we present their aggregated usage data to  preserve their anonymity.    4.2.1 Average Number of Meetings and Average Use  of Student Explorer   On average, advisors used Student Explorer most during the  weeks that lead up to the math midterm, and they used it more  often than they met with students by almost a factor of two especially during the middle and most intensive part of the Bridge  program (Figure 2).      Figure 2. Average Weekly Student Explorer Recorded Events   Compared to Average Advisor Meetings with Students     Usage peaked four days before the math midterm exam, which is  consistent with anecdotal reports from both advisors and the  Bridge leadership who reported that the math midterm (taken by  all Bridge students) is the only high stakes exam students take  before the final, so it serves as a benchmark for the term.   4.2.2 Advisors' Use of Student Explorer   Aggregate counts of which Student Explorer pages advisors  accessed are presented in Table 1. Advisors passed through an  already established tool known as the Advising File which  contains student demographic and enrollment information over  300 times, suggesting that the Advising File was used as a  gateway fairly often. Advisors also frequently used the  Alerts   boxes, clicking on the  Engage  box, which automatically opens  upon term selection, the most. The low numbers of  Explore  and   Encourage  clicks suggests that few advisors scrutinized those  categories. Also, very few advisors viewed the  Full Summary  of  week-to-week student performance progress, suggesting that   0   10   20   30   40   50   Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7   Student Explorer Activity 1-on-1 Meetings    Math Midterm    115    advisors may be more interested in the students' current status as  opposed to their progression over the course of the term.

The majority of coinciding face-to-face  meeting / Student Explorer use occurred during weeks 3-5. This  finding makes sense because it is the window after students are  settled into the program but before Bridge is winding down for the  summer. Both Student Explorer use and the frequency of meetings  with students understandably drop off during the final week, when  students have completed the majority of work.   Figure 3 represents unique usage and meeting events that are  matched by the date of event, the student, and the advisor, for a  total of a total of 297 unique matches. These matches were further  parsed to designate whether or not advisors checked the students  Student Explorer data before, during, or after their meeting with  them. Over the course of Bridge, for example, the advisors viewed  the summary page of the student while they were meeting with  them 100 times in total. The Math courses had the fewest  instances of student class detail page hits among the three Bridge  courses, despite its designated  high stakes  status.      Figure 3. Student Explore Used Before, During, or After   Advisors Met with Advisees    4.3 Post-Bridge Advisor Survey  A post-Bridge survey was administered to compare advisors Pre- Bridge perceptions of which courses would be discussed most  often during Bridge, with their assessment of which courses were  actually discussed more often. Advisors were asked, please rank  the following courses by how often you raised issues related to  them to determine which courses advisors reported discussing  the most during their meetings with students. Results indicated   that there was a shift from pre-Bridge attitudes: math and English  both dominated the first position.   Advisors also identified when they felt Student Explorer would be  most valuable: before, during, or after meetings with students.  Advisors rated their agreement with the following statements:  This activity [Student Explorer use] was a valuable use of my  time during Bridge (before/during,/after) meetings with students  using a 1-5 Likert scale from Strongly Disagree-Strongly Agree.  While the post-Bridge survey shows slight changes in advisors  perceived usefulness, these changes were not significant,  suggesting that advisors were able to consistently gauge when the  tool would be most useful them before and after they actually  used it.   5. DISCUSSION  Student Explorer was designed as an advisor-facing tool intended  to provide academic advisors access to the achievement and  engagement data of students, and to represent that data in a way  that is informative and easily actionable. Before the  implementation of Student Explore during Bridge, this  information was traditionally collected via methods that have  reliability issues (i.e., student self-reports), or other mechanisms  that may contain information that is not timely enough to act on  (i.e., midterm reports submitted by instructors).    These concerns regarding reliability and timeliness were  amplified for advisors in the accelerated Bridge program where  the term was much shorted that in the STEM program. Examining  advisor perceptions as well as their actual use patterns, however,  surprised us in several important ways that impact design and has  use implications for other learning analytics-powered  interventions.     5.1 Advisor Use Patterns  We were surprised to learn that advisors used Student Explorer  during their meetings with students. Figure 3 shows that advisors  used Student Explorer during meetings nearly twice as often as  they did before they met with them (advisors seldom used Student  Explorer after student meetings). This unintended use is an  important lesson because Student Explorer was designed to be an  advisor-facing application, not student-facing. Once we learned  that advisors would show their students the screen, we quickly  added a button to hide the E3 status of other students so that  students cannot inadvertently see the names of their peers' in the   Alerts  boxes (Figure 1 top, A).    It is also interesting that advisors opinions about when Student  Explorer would be most valuable for them to use did not change  significantly over the course of the Bridge term; especially since  advisors predominately used of Student Explorer during meetings  with students. We are unable, however, to determine if advisors  referred to the data during the meeting or actually shared the  display with students. Anecdotal evidence suggests that both of  these possibilities occurred, but we lack the data that would tell us  which was more common.     The elements of the application (e.g., the graphs comparing one  student to the class average) were not designed to be viewed by  students, however, so we will be advised to take the potential for  student access into account, even when learning analytics  interventions are not designed for them. In effect, this may  simplify our long-term plans for creating a student-facing version  of Student Explorer, including appropriate interface scaffolds for  both advisor and student users.   0   50   100   150   CSP100  Page   Engligh  Page   Math Page Summary  Page   Before Meeting During Meeting After Meeting   116    5.2 Further Research  The unintended uses of Student Explorer witnessed in this phase  of our research indicate that we need to better understand the  nature of the information exchange between advisors and their  students. To this end, our research agenda includes interviews  with students that will focus on understanding how students  viewed their own data (when it was shown to them), and their  related anticipated and unanticipated uses of that data [2]. In  particular, which strategies do advisors suggest during or after  meetings with students. This latter line of inquiry is designed to  better understand the how students respond to advisors  suggestions, and if those strategies affected students performance  and/or effort. If so, we would like to know which of the advisors  recommended strategies were effective so that we can A) report  that information back to advisors and B) consider implementing  suggested strategies into the Student Explorer framework, similar  to the approach adopted by Course Signals using the external  Passnote application (itap.purdue.edu/studio/passnote). This work  will occur in parallel with our continued conversations with  advisors in order to ensure that Student Explorer's user interface  and technical infrastructure can continue to be refined so that it is  easier to use and displays relevant and actionable information.   6. CONCLUSION  We expected Student Explorer to aid advisors by providing them  with student achievement information that has been otherwise  unavailable to them. We learned that advisors predominantly used  Student Explores during their meetings with students. This is  telling, and suggests that any learning analytics intervention may  be used by an unintended user group, albeit indirectly.  Consequently, those interested in designing learning analytics  interventions should be mindful of designing user interfaces with  maximum flexibility and privacy options, particularly where  student data is concerned.     7.

INTRODUCTION  Given the increasing quality and efficiency pressures facing  universities it is not surprising that learning analytics has placed  considerable focus on the early identification of students at risk of  failure [7, 9, 17]. The prediction, or forecasting, of students at  future risk has consequently been a high institutional priority [22,  27]. Following the social sciences generally, the predictive  method of choice has been regression analysis (of one kind or  another) using a constellation of demographic (static) and                     engagement (dynamic) variables, the latter usually emanating  from the LMS traces students leave as they navigate the online  elements of their courses [e.g. 18].  This common reliance on regression is entirely uncontroversial,  but its hegemonic status in many branches of the social sciences  has served to sideline other promising approaches that are far  simpler and much easier for people from non-statistical  backgrounds to understand [2, 19, 20]. As Armstrong [3] put it  Regression analysis is clearly one of the most important tools  available to researchers. However, it is not the only game in  town. We present here an investigation of the merits of a  plausible, simpler alternative to regression for identifying students  at-risk that may be a better tool if our aim is not only predictive  accuracy but also organisational diffusion and the embedding of  change.  This paper seeks to extend the concepts and framework of modest  computing [13, 14] to analytics. There are several reasons to  favour the parsimonious and simple predictive approach over the  expensive and complex, but perhaps the most important is that the  simple is often a better predictor than the complex, or at least  comparable or practically equivalent, as the fast and frugal  heuristic literature has documented [20]. Practically equivalent  is a key term here. The aim of the modest computing agenda is  not simplicity for simplicitys sake, but to invest in high leverage  initiatives and methodologies that will have significant impact for  relatively minimal investment. Whatever the technique, it should  be a means to the end of orchestrating [13] the educational  interface, not an end in itself. Modest computing seeks rather to  emphasize adoption, scale and sustainability more to shift from  pure invention to a diffusion of innovation perspective. [13].  As attested to by a wide range of organisational change and  adoption approaches [e.g. 24, 28], when the mechanisms on offer  are easy to adopt, configurable at the users end, and solve an  actual practitioner problem, they are much more likely to be  implemented, and implemented as they were intended.  Conversely put, it is to avoid, where possible, hermetic, abstruse,  overly complex approaches, especially those that serve the  interests of the researchers at the expense of the practitioners,  where complex methods become an end in themselves, a ritual to  impress others, and at the same time opportunities to learn how to  do things better are missed [20].  In exploring the potential of extending these modest computing  principles to analytics, this paper marks a preliminary assessment  of the possibility of a modest analytics. To this end we directly  compare the utility of the index methoda simple tabulation  techniquewith the kind of regression analysis typically used to  identify students at risk.

INDEX METHOD  The forecasting literature shares two of learning analytics core  goals, to find the most effective means of identifying a future  event or estimating a future trend. In educational terms these two  goals may be expressed as, for example, the need to identify  which students are likely to struggle in their studies and mapping  the cumulative long term impacts of curriculum innovations on  educational outcomes. Overall, the forecasting literature displays  a catholic and utilitarian approach to the exploration of techniques  and their combinations. For example, the realisation that expert  judgement, if augmented, could still play a role in forecasting  accuracy [8] led to a reassessment of previous research, along  with a number of new studies that methodically combined  judgements, or used them in tandem with statistical approaches.  Such approaches as the Delphi technique and judgemental  bootstrapping demonstrated advantages over numerical only, or  expert opinion only, approaches in predicting outcomes in a range  of practical areas [1, 2, 20].  Perhaps the most intriguing, and certainly the simplest, technique  documented is the 'index method', often called the unit weight  approach. The method appears almost childishly uncomplicated,  and hence unlikely to be of much consequence. Its origins,  according to Armstrong [3], are with Benjamin Franklin, who  essentially suggested the best way to make a difficult choice  between two alternatives was to divide a piece of paper in half, on  one side list the pros and the other the cons on the full range of  known criteria, weight the criteria, and then tally up the resulting  scores to make a selection.   Where the index method has been tested against various  predictive alternatives, typically regression analyses, it has  usually matched and in many cases bettered these more  commonly used and more complex alternatives [4, 5, 11, 12, 16,  29]. For example, Armstrong and Graefe [5] compared the index  method to a range of well-known regression approaches on the  outcome of 29 US Presidential elections (1896 to 2008). They  derived each presidential candidates likelihood of victory simply  by tabulating the accrued head-to-head score for one candidate  over another on 60 biographical variables, from candidate height,  to age, weight, tone of voice, home state and so on. They found  that in terms of binary outcome (who won the election) the index  method fared better than all 3 well-established regression  approaches it was pitted against. In terms of predicting the vote  share of the candidates, the index method outperformed all but  one regression study, and here the difference was marginal.   Dana and Dawes [12] looked at a variety of real world  distributions and compared regression coefficients to a range of  alternative, and simpler, coefficients, including unit weights.  They found that the alternative prediction methods presented in  this article quite often defeated ordinary least squares in our  competition (p. 328). With respect to the unit weight method,  they found that Although equal [unit] weights were not the most  efficient of the alternative methods, they were practically as good.  The decrement in explainable variation on validation caused by  using unit weights as opposed to the best coefficients rarely  exceeded 2% or 3%... In Wainers (1976) words, estimating  coefficients apparently dont make no nevermind, or at least it  doesnt for most social science data (p. 324).   Despite the index methods comparative success, it is rarely  reported in any literature and presumably rarely used. This is a  pity, as its pragmatic value alone warrants further investigation. It  has occasionally been used to estimate student performance vis-- vis regression, but the results have been mixed; Armstrong [4]  found 3 studies favouring the index method and 1 favouring  regression. To our knowledge the method has not been used to  predict student outcomes since 1974. Again, this is a pity because  the index method, if it does indeed show itself to be a valid  substitute for more complex risk algorithms, could provide a  quick, flexible, practitioner-centred, and adoption friendly  indicator of student risk that would be of great utility. For  example, if educators alter their curriculum by emphasising or de- emphasising particular elements, such as online discussions or  formative tests, they would be able to immediately update their  student risk analysis to reflect these changes. This would be very  difficult to do with an institutionally mandated, or commercial,  risk algorithm. This would be possible with the index method  because:    Unlike regression analysis, the index method does not  estimate weights from the data, so sample size is not a  limiting factor. Small samples (say a previous class cohort)  and limited observations per variable are no barrier to its use  [5, 16, 29]    There is no limit to the variables that can be incorporated, so  the full range of domain knowledge can be brought to bear.  This contrasts with regression models, where increasing  variables can decrease the models ex-ante predictive  accuracy, given a constant sample size [5, 16, 20]    It is straightforward to add or subtract variables to reflect  new understandings/empirical findings and with no  consequence to the methods integrity [5]    It can incorporate judgement, and so context. Where data is  scarce but expert opinion exists about the relevance and  directionality of a variable (i.e. whether the variable is  favourable or unfavourable for the relevant outcome), it can  be included [3]    It is easily understood and owned by educators. They do  not need to know any statistical theory to apply the method,  although it helps to be able to critically evaluate prior studies  that may be relied upon for help in identifying the variables  to be included.    3. METHOD   3.1 Data  Four first year courses at the University of South Australia were  chosen on the basis of their previous engagement with the early  intervention program Enhancing Student Academic Potential  (ESAP). Each course had previously been identified as having a  high percentage of at-risk students relative to other courses in  their discipline area. The courses were from a range of  disciplines: Accounting, Computer Science, Biology, and  Business/Law. There were two years of data drawn, 2011 and  2012. 2011 was used to develop models that would then be  applied to 2012. There were 1230 students in the 2011 data set  and 1102 students in 2012.   3.2 Index Method  We selected the independent variables a priori, using the student  attrition and learning analytics literature, asking the coordinators  of the courses for their suggestions, and by eyeballing the data.   119    We only included variables that could be drawn from one of our  online systems. The majority of the variables were demographic  and performance based. Only one variable was dynamic  first  logon to the course LMS. Other dynamic data was unreliable or  proved too difficult to extract.  Each variable for each student was initially given a score of -1, 0,  +1 based on its hypothesised effect on students chances of  passing the course. A score of zero meant the variable was neutral  with respect to passing. Where knowledge of the effect of  variables is good weighting can be applied [16] and we did this  for GPA and for any previous notice of poor academic progress  (an academic warning sent to students). Partly these weightings  reflected the number of evaluations of the student implied by the  variable. For example, a student on a second academic  notification would have shown poor prior performance on 4  previous occasions in most instances, so the weighted score on  this variable was 4. Each students score was calculated by adding  across the columns of variables where they achieved a positive or  negative score. Scores were given for: gender, non-English  speaking background, repeating the course, being enrolled full- time, for having no parent completing school, for having had a  deferred exam in the study period just past,  for failing,  withdrawing late or only barely passing any course in the study  period just past,  for a fail or bare pass in a pre-requisite course,  for late LMS log-in (post 7 days from course start), and, as stated  above, low GPA or academic notice of poor progress. We used  2011 student data to set the index score and used a simple linear  regression to develop a model to test on 2012 data for the same  courses. This regression achieved an R2 of 0.38 for the 2011 data.  The final predictive model was:  Mark = -2.91(Index score) + 57.82  Applying the index model to the 2012 data to generate predictions  for each students 2012 score yielded a significant correlation in  the expected direction of r = -.58, (p < 0.05). This result is  illustrated in Figure 1 below, where predictions of the 2012  student marks were made using the index method and are shown  in green, overlaying the actual marks (blue), with a correlation of  0.58 between the two series     Figure 1: the actual (blue) and predicted (green) student marks are  shown for the index method.   3.3 Regression  In contrast to the approach taken for the index method, the  regression model was constructed through an experimental  exploration of the independent variables, using backward  elimination, to model student marks as the explanatory variable.    A collection of both quantitative and qualitative independent  variables was considered, where at each step, the variable with the  smallest t value (significance at 0.05) was removed.  The final  predictive model was:   Mark  = 16.71 - 2.64(Gender) + 0.29(Age) -  4.87(AcademicLoad) + 0.11(EarnedUnits) + 6.44(GPA)-  7.74(WithdrewPreviously) + 3.92(EnrolledNextYear) -  19.88(Counselling) - 17.38(PreviousNoticePoorProgress)      (1)   which reported an R2 value of  0.57, indicating the independent  variables explain approximately 57% of the variability in Mark.   The independent variables captured the students Gender, their  age, an Academic Load of full- or part-time, the number of units  earned in their program to date, their GPA, whether they had  withdrawn late from a course in the previous study period,  whether they were enrolled in the following year, whether they  had been recommended for academic counselling and whether  they had been given a notice of poor academic progress.   Predictions of the 2012 student marks were made using (1) and  are shown in green in Figure 2, overlaying the actual marks  (blue), with a correlation of 0.70 between the two series. Testing  of the model residuals indicated no severe issues with the  assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, independence and  Normality.      Figure 2: the actual (blue) and predicted (green) student marks are  shown for the regression analysis1.    4. DISCUSSION  In this comparative study we pitted a standard linear multiple  regression based approach to identifying students at risk of failure  against a simpler approach, the index method. Our findings are  consistent with the preponderance of previous studies in showing  the index method to be competitive with regression: we found the  correlation coefficients for the model-derived scores and the  actual 2012 scores for both regression (r = 0.70) and the index  method (r = - 0.58) to be significant and largely in line with each  other. While the regression approach yielded a higher correlation  it should be noted that it also produced more variability in its  predictions (which can be seen in the green regression model  predictions spanning a larger range than the index model  predictions). What the index model lost in correlation it picked up                                                                     1 The gap in predicted marks on the right hand side due to   variables used for prediction in the regression model having  missing values at that end of the data set    120    in reduced variability  an important consideration when the  purpose is prediction.   There are various explanations for this phenomena reported in the  literature. The most prominent concerns the robustness of  regression models i.e. the ability of the model to both fit the data  used as a source for the model and predict in the novel population  for which the model was built. Although in comparative studies  regression is better at fitting the data than alternatives, it is a  poorer predictive instrument in out-of-sample populations, which  suggests overfitting of the data is involved [11, 20], although that  explanation does not apply here. Two other explanations centre  on the amount of information that the index method permits  relative to regression. Einhorn and Hogarth [16] suggest that unit  weight approaches are able to include more information as the  included variables are not estimated from the data and so do not  consume degrees of freedom, therefore, one can have as many  variables in the prediction equation as necessary (p. 184).  Several researchers have suggested that it might be the  identification of the variables, rather than their weighting, that is  important in ex ante predictions. In this case the power of the  index method rests largely in the a priori selection of variables  and their signs based on the hard empirical and theoretical work  of earlier researchers [12, 16].   While in terms of linear prediction this paper found the regression  approach to be marginally more accurate, this paper was not  intended to be a reproof of linear multiple regression, which we  acknowledge is a valuable technique. It was intended rather to  pave the way for the exploration of simpler models that may  facilitate the adoption and diffusion of risk management in  educational settings. Simpler techniques may have these  properties because they are better understood by a wide range of  educators and are easy to adjust to changing circumstances and  integrate with current practices.   There are several limitations to this study. Our test procedure used  one years data for model development, which is an artificial  constraint not likely to be faced by model developers in situ. We  attempted to address this shortcoming by cross-validating the  regression model by using the 2012 data to construct a predictive  model.  The result was a model containing the same explanatory  variables as in (1) with similar regression coefficients. Using  more than one years data for model development may (or may  not) improve the robustness of the regression model, a possibility  we will test in the future. We note, however, that the index  method suffers from no such limitation, in that the models  robustness is free from the requirement of many years of data and  with that, the assumption that the student cohort behaviour will  remain stable over time, which is ultimately an intrinsic  assumption of any regression model.  We also used very few  dynamic variables (e.g dwell time and other LMS data, physical  class attendance, online library interactions etc.) as the extraction  of this data at our University is still under development. The  inclusion of this data may alter our findings, although the addition  of a number of new variables could be expected to favour the  index method [5]. The choice of an additive linear model for  comparison does not exhaust the regression technique  possibilities. Other approaches may yield different results. Our  choice was based on the standard approach followed in the  literature that has previously tested index and unit weight  approaches, and findings that suggest complex and nonlinear  models do not offer a greater predictive dividend [4].   It is also important to note that our findings do not specifically  support the scenario we offered earlier of an educator using the  index method to progressively update their risk identification  model. Rather, we took the preliminary step of establishing the  viability of the index method as a predictor of student risk by  comparing it to an established approach on a common data set.  Our follow-up research will investigate risk analysis in niche  settings, where academics are able to integrate context specific  variables that are closely tied to their curriculum design and  teaching practice. We hope then to be able to investigate the  flexibility of the method and its potential for adoption and  diffusion.   One objection to our approach needs to be canvassed here as it  goes to the heart of our rationale. Our comparison, so this  criticism goes, is a straw man argument, or about to become one,  as big data and the associated data mining methodologies will  replace regression anyway, or supplement it in a way that is a  stepwise change from the process used here. We certainly  concede that there are data mining alternatives designed to  neutralise regressions weaknesses with large data sets consisting  of hundreds of variables [e.g. 15]. And, to be sure, the mining of  big data sets has facilitated important discoveries, from the  humanities [25] to biology [26]. However, two caveats should be  sounded. Firstly, data mining has not shown itself to be superior  to other methods in direct comparisons of forecast accuracy [2].  While education may produce student risk data that is uniquely  amenable to exploitation via these methods, this has yet to be  established [cf. 6].   This leads to our second caveat: the importance of context to  higher education. There is considerable hope in the learning  analytics literature that big data can make a significant  contribution to our knowledge of student failure or dropout (e.g.  the well-known Predictive Analytics Research (PAR) Framework,  that pools data from six US universities [21]). One consequence  of these attempts to distil new truths from vats of big data is that  the more data is pooled, the more context is lost. Context, of  course, is information, so omitting it is, by default, losing  information. Context is also essential to interpretability: it is the  Rosetta Stone of analytics. The danger of a large decontextualized  data set is that meaning will be lost and the end result only  relevant to whatever context is held in common. PARs interim  finding, that there is a significant correlation between  disenrollment and the number of concurrent courses in which  students were enrolled [7 p. 5] may be an underwhelming  testament to this possibility.    Of course big data and cross-institutional projects are potentially  valuable, and their macro findings may serve to inform micro  practices [7]. However, modest analytic approaches like the index  method that are flexible and adaptable by the user may play an  important role also. A modest analytics can be sensitive to  context, and facilitates the working with, rather than on, educators  [23], which is likely to be advantageous to the diffusion and  embedding of student risk management practices.   5.

Peer assessment can also have benefits related to the quality of learning. Several studies have shown that students can addition- ally learn when evaluating work of other students [22], but these findings are not universal [19]. It can also be argued that peer as- sessment reduces the workload for instructors, saving time in the process. However, depending on the setup and implementation time this might not be the case. Also the fact that teachers have to formalize the assessment process can benefit both students and teachers as they have to clarify the educational objectives, goals and the grading scale [23]. To be used as a replacement for instruc- tor grading, the grades based on peer assessment should match to the grades of instructors. Most studies evaluate the accuracy of peer assessment as adequate compared to instructor evaluation, however this comparison is only useful if one assumes that instructor assess- ments are valid, which he suggests is a doubtful assumption in some contexts [23].  Even though peer review and assessment have advantages, they have not become a mainstream evaluation feature in universities. Pearce et al. [16] argue that this is in part because of difficulty of usage and price of dedicated peer review and assessment systems. They point to online tools as promising solutions to this problem but they deplore the fact that so few of them exist.  In this paper, in order to encourage the adoption of peer as- sessment, we present a novel extension of a social media platform (GRAASP), which can be used to setup a peer assessment activ- ity. Then we report a case study of peer assessment using GRAASP in a Social Media course taught at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) with 60 master students and ana- lyze the level of agreement between the assessment of students and instructors in the evaluation of short individual reports. Our find- ings suggest that the level of agreement is significant. Finally, to see whether the assessment of students and instructors was solely based on appearance and could be replicated without reading the content of the reports, we conducted a boundary case experiment with 40 twelve-year old kids who assessed the reports solely based on their look. Our results show that there is no agreement between kids and students and thus suggest that students and instructors are, at least to some extent, influenced by the content of the report.  It should be highlighted that in the context of this social media course, the objective of the peer assessment is twofold. First, it aims at assessing the work of the students. Second, it aims at intro- ducing students to the challenges and the opportunities related to ratings in social media platforms.  133    This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 presents how GRAASP was used for peer assess- ment in a Social Media course. Section 4 discusses the evaluation methodology before Section 5 presents the results. Finally Sec- tion 6 wraps up with a conclusion and discussion of future work.  2. RELATED WORK Hereafter we make a brief overview of previous findings on peer  assessment and present existing peer assessment systems.  2.1 Peer assessment findings Peer assessment is generally found to be formative [16], but stu-  dents may dislike this work as they feel that this is the  teachers responsibility  [1]. Cho et al. [3] found that if students were guided and were provided scaffolds they took their job seriously and their results where as valid as instructor ratings. This even though stu- dents themselves do not believe their ratings are reliable.  However, these positive results are not universal [24]. For ex- ample, Sadler and Good [19] find that even though student and in- structor assessment are strongly correlated, they do not appear to be linked to improved understanding and higher performing students may suffer when graded by others.  Furthermore, both evaluations by students and instructors can be prone to biases. For students, these biases include inexperience in the field, inexperience in grading, and basic biases, such as rat- ing friends favorably [7], as well as more advanced biases, such as making pacts with others [13]. Instructors can be affected by sim- ilar biases. For example the number of papers to grade can lead to rushed evaluation, individual grading (one instructor) is less re- liable than combined ratings [18], instructors can be influenced by expectations and other biases, finally as the knowledge level of the instructor is much higher than that of students, it might be diffi- cult for her to distinguish between small scale differences between students.  In the context of MOOCs, Piech et al. [17] address the problem of peer assessment accuracy and suggest that student assessment validity can be significantly improved with a corrective algorithm. They also proposed to use the algorithm for more intelligent distri- bution of assignments between graders.  2.2 Peer assessment systems As mentioned above, there are not many available online peer  assessment systems [16]. An early, but now extinct, web-based peer grading system, was called PG (Peer Grader) and had already been proposed in 2001 [9].  More recently, researchers at the university of Melbourne intro- duced PRAZE [15],a dedicated system for peer assessment. It has been successfully evaluated in several courses. Unfortunately, it is currently only available for Australian Universities.  TURNITIN1 is a plagiarism detection tool, which also provides a module to allow student to comment each others work. Turnitin provides both an online interface and a mobile app.  Some learning management systems (LMS) provide modules for peer assessment. The self peer assessment (SPA) module in Black- board is such an example.2 It is quite rigid and does not allow for late hand ins or proxy submission. WORKSHOP in Moodle3 is also a sophisticated tool that has been tested in large classrooms [14]. As these modules are strongly coupled to their respective LMS it makes it their adoption difficult beyond the LMS users.  1turnitin.com 2www.niu.edu/blackboard/assess/spa.shtml 3docs.moodle.org/23/en/Workshop_module  3. CASE STUDY: SOCIAL MEDIA We performed our evaluation in the Spring Semester 2013 dur-  ing the Social Media course at EPFL with 60 master students in Computer Science. During this course each student had to hand in a two-page project report to show a long-tail effect in a social media platform chosen by him or her. In a typical example of a project a student took IMDB4 as social media and inquired whether there will be a small collection of very well popular movies [...] which have plenty reviews, against a very large collection of movies with a very low number of reviews (which will represent our long tail). In order to fully immerse students into the topic, we decide to use social media platforms to deposit course material (GRAASP), share useful links (TWITTER), and host slides (SLIDESHARE). Fur- thermore, we used peer assessment for the grading of the student project as social media make extensive use of peer review systems.  Proper instructions are a key success factor for peer evaluation. We made clear to the students at the beginning of the course that their report will be evaluated by peers, and that they will have to evaluated the work of about 20 peers. As the reports were dis- cussing the long tail effect in various social media platforms, we also made clear that their reading was a learning activity. Finally, it was announced that the peer evaluation done by them would only be taken into account if not deviating significantly from the eval- uation carried out by the experts to ensure fairness. Since there is a lack of peer assessment tools, we devised a novel extension of GRAASP to accommodate peer assessment.  Further activities including teamwork and live presentations in the classroom were organized but not discussed in this paper.  3.1 Graasp GRAASP is a flexible social media platform that was initially  developed to support communities of practice and extended to sup- port collaborative learning activities [2, 11, 12] as well as online science labs for inquiry-based learning at school [10]. GRAASP can be freely exploited by schools, universities and non-profit or- ganizations for learning activities and knowledge management. In GRAASP, people organize their personal and shared projects, in- terests and activities into public or private contextual spaces, where they share relevant resources and necessary apps with invited mem- bers. For example, for the Social Media course, the instructor cre- ated a dedicated space, named Social Media, where students would find lecture material, such as slides or videos and administrative information.  The design of GRAASP follows a flexible bottom-up permissions management approach when it comes to joint projects. Instead of having a top-level administrator in control of all project spaces, everything is managed at the space level. Thereby in the case of the Social Media course, students were able to create a space for their group project, invite their group members, close the space for others and drop documents together with other resources needed for the project.  3.2 Peer assessment using Graasp For the course we have developed an extension of GRAASP as  a proof-of-concept where the reviewer tasks are automated. We are currently working on further improvements, which will allow creating dedicated peer assessment spaces, where a summary of all peer assessment tasks will be visible. We plan to roll out this functionality in the coming months.  To setup the peer assessment activity, students were instructed to create a space in GRAASP, drop their work in it, invite the instruc-  4http://www.imdb.com  134    tor, and leave the space in order to be not able to see the reviewers. Then the instructor invited randomly assigned peers into the space to perform the evaluation. All participants of the evaluation were instructed to use a 5-point Likert-type scale for grading the reports. Since the course was about social media, the grade scale was in- spired by the ratings system often found in social media (e.g. it is used for product review on Amazon.com):   5 stars: I love the report  4 stars: I like the report  3 stars: The report is OK  2 stars: I dont like the report  1 star: I hate the report  Peers were instructed to focus on the following list of criteria when evaluating the reports:   Is the report about a social media  Is the long tail hypothesis clear  Is the collected dataset representative  Is the report technically advanced  Is the report well written  Is it interesting and creative  We did not collect the grades regarding each of the criteria in- dependently, but recorded one final grade per report. Once the reviewers completed their task, the instructor was able to see the average result of the peer evaluation as well as the detailed grades distribution as depicted in Figure 1.  Figure 1: Rating details for a report in Graasp  3.3 Reviewers The peer assessment activity was performed by three groups of  reviewers: instructors, students and kids. The group of instruc- tors consisted of the two lecturers and the two teaching assistants. Each of the instructors graded all the reports. The group of stu- dents consisted of all 60 students in the Social Media course (age 23-28). Each of the students was instructed to grade 20 randomly assigned reports. The group of kids consisted of 40 schoolchildren (age 10-12), each kid graded 15 randomly assigned reports. This assignment procedure ended in each report being assigned to 4 in- structors, 20 students and 10 kids.  Note that the idea behind assigning a peer assessment task to kids was to see whether they could predict the grades of instructors and students by the appearance alone without reading them and under- standing the content. To perform this boundary case experiment, the kids did not use GRAASP to rate the two-page reports, instead they were each given 15 small 5.83 x 4.13 inch (14.8 x 10.5 cm) cards with the reports printed on them as shown in Figure 2. Most of the text of in the reports was too small to be read by the kids and most of them did not understand English.  Figure 2: Example of a report card for kids  4. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY To evaluate the validity of the peer assessment we analyzed the  level of agreement in grades between instructors and students.  Measuring group consensus. In the analysis we focused on the level of agreement between groups. Unfortunately, reliable inter- group agreement measures are still lacking [25]. Hence, a common practice is to first define a consensus in each group of raters and in this way to reduce the problem of measuring inter-group agreement to the problem of measuring inter-rater agreement. The consensus is often defined as the median or the mean for ordinal scales or as the mode (modal category) for nominal scales [25]. Since in our study we employed five-star grade ordinal scale, we selected the mean as consensus value. In the context of the Social Media course, this consensus value also had a pedagogical sense as it could be seen as an instance of the wisdom of the crowd, a frequently used concept in social media (e.g. Wikipedia).  Measuring correlation between group consensuses. In order to get a first visual idea of the agreement between groups, consensus values can be represented on scatter plots together with regression lines with 90% confidence intervals for the regression slope.  Then to get a numerical figure of the dependency of the con- sensus values, we computed the Pearson correlation and the Spear- man rank correlation [21] coefficients. In general correlation does not show the level of agreement, it just shows the level of asso- ciation between variables. It is possible that grades of two raters are strongly correlated (Pearson or Spearman), but at the same time they can have little agreement. Thus correlation is not suitable for measuring the level of inter-rater agreement. Based on the liter- ature, Cohens kappa [5] is the adequate tool for our purpose as it is frequently used in behavioural sciences to compute inter-rater agreement.  135    Measuring agreement between group consensuses. The original version of Cohens kappa targets nominal variables  and assumes that all disagreements are equal. This is not the case in our study, where disagreement can differ in severity. Therefore we use Cohens weighted kappa [4], a statistic suitable for measuring the level of inter-rater agreement on ordinal scale. Note that as a measure of reliability, the weighted kappa is equal [8] to the intra- class correlation coefficient (ICC), a common measure of reliability of either different raters, or different items on a scale [20].  5. EVALUATION RESULTS We followed the evaluation methodology presented in the pre-  vious section to measure level of agreement between two groups of reviewers: (1) instructors and students, as well as, (2) kids and students.  A sample of five reports from the dataset is presented in Figure 3 and shows the per-report consensus values. Note that the discrep- ancy between the number of assigned students per report (20) and the actual number of grades is due to the fact that some students did not complete the evaluation assignment. In the end, more than 92% evaluation assignments were completed. We are currently prepar- ing the dataset used in this study and plan to publish it online to- gether with the analysis so it can be repeated.  Figure 3: data excerpt representing consensus grades  5.1 Students vs instructors Hereafter, we compare the student and the instructor assessment  in terms of correlation and agreement.  Correlation. The visual representation of the data on the scatter plot in Figure 4 indicates that grades of students for reports increase with the grades of instructors.  Figure 4: A scatter plot of instructor grades vs student grades with a linear regression line and 90% slope confidence intervals  Indeed, the results of the correlation analysis presented in Fig- ure 5 point out that there is a strong (0.825) linear dependence be- tween grades of students and instructors with a low significance level of the null hypothesis (independence of grades), which allows  to reject it. The strong positive Spearman correlation (0.752) in- dicates that students tend to give higher grades for better reports, i.e., reports that received higher grades from instructors. Due to the strong correlation, grades provided by students can be used to predict the grades of instructors.  Figure 5: Pearson and Spearman correlations together with significance levels of the null hypothesis  Agreement. To measure the level of agreement, we computed Co- hens weighted kappa, presented in Figure 6. When comparing stu- dents and instructors, the weighted kappa equals to 0.774, which can be interpreted as a strong agreement. The significance level (1.36E-13) indicates that the null hypothesis (that there is no agree- ment) can be rejected and the agreement between students and in- structors is statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval is rather narrow and in the high agreement area. Since the agreement is high, we can use just one rater (in our case a consensus decision of students) to provide the grade.  Figure 6: Weighted Kappa, 95% confidence intervals and sig- nificance levels of the null hypothesis  5.2 Students vs Kids Hereafter, we compare the student and the kid assessment in  terms of correlation and agreement.  Correlation. The scatter plot in Figure 7 indicates that linear de- pendency between the grades of students and kids is weak.  Figure 7: Scatter plot of kid grades vs student grades with a linear regression line and 90% slope confidence intervals  For instance, the graph shows that reports that received grade close to 4 from students, received anything from 2 to 4.5 from kids. The results of the correlation analysis presented in Figure 5 indicate  136    that there is a weak (0.201) linear dependency between grades of students and kids. The significance level (0.124) indicates that the null hypothesis (independence of grades) cannot be rejected. A similar picture is observed for Spearman rank correlation. The low value of the Spearman rank correlation (0.205) indicates that the monotonic relation between grades of students and kids is weak. That is when students give a high grade for a report it is probable that kids can give low grade for the same report. So their grades are not reliable. The weak correlation can also be interpreted as an indicator that students pay attention to the content of reports and are able to evaluate it. They do not base their conclusion solely on the visual representation. In order to confirm this hypothesis additional scrutiny is required to be able to remove other factors that could have influenced the grading process.  Agreement. When comparing students and kids in Figure 6, the weighted kappa equals 0.196, which indicates no agreement or an agreement by chance. The significance level (0.065) of the null hypothesis (independence of grades) indicates that it cannot be re- jected. Thus there is significant evidence that the grades of students and kids are not in a agreement.  6. CONCLUSION Peer assessment is a timely and challenging topic. In this paper,  in order to tackle the lack of existing peer assessment systems, we presented a novel extension of GRAASP, devised for that purpose. We also discussed our experience using GRAASP for peer assess- ment in a Social Media course.  To see whether the assessment of students and instructors was mostly based on appearance of project reports and could be repli- cated without reading the content of the reports, we conducted an experiment with kids who assessed the reports solely based on their look. Our analysis showed that there is a strong agreement between grades assigned by students and instructors and little agreement be- tween grades by students and kids. These results were obtained from a well-defined evaluation scenario and a large number of re- viewers for a single report (20 peers). This number will however be reduced to 15 in the next academic year to take into account students feedback. These results encourage us to further extend the peer assessment features in GRAASP and to further evaluate the impact of peer assessment in our courses, not only as an evaluation mean, but also as a learning activity.

This infor- mation is meant to enable teachers, students, and students peers to asses, reflect on, and discuss student thinking. Stu- dent centered pedagogies focus on creating representations and learner interactions that extend well beyond simple mul- tiple choice questions or fill in the blank answers.  Making sense of this diverse set of multimodal input is one of the biggest challenges to successful implementation of tech- nology in the learning process. The volume of data gen- erated goes beyond what a single teacher can be expected to consume, let alone make actionable, real-time decisions concerning the direction of their teaching [6]. Teachers need tools which assist in summarizing and categorizing the ideas generated by their students.  Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is popular for classifying student responses according to the words they contain [9]. LSA can also be effective in learning analytics, support- ing formative assessment by giving teachers tools to visu- ally identify and understand participation and discourse pro- cesses and information flows [13].  Computational image classifiers have the ability to classify an image according to similarity of the objects they contatin [3]. Learner based methods require sufficient training data to generate a classifier, and the parameters of the classification algorithm must be fine-tuned [2].  Both LSA and image classification work on a narrow scope of student work, and in many implementations require a sig- nificant amount of labeled training data. Training classifiers and pre-labeling response types is infeasible in the bloom- ing, buzzing classroom [14]. With the limitations of these purely content driven classifiers in mind, we propose a new classification algorithm driven by user interactions, which is flexible enough to operate on any form of input. Involving learners in the process requires students to engage with their peers ideas and identify the patterns and relationships con- tained within them, an engineering practice encouraged by the Next Generation Science Standards [10].  To this end, we present a new form of semi-automated clas- sification coined Collaborative Spatial Classification, which highlights how new forms of user interaction information can be used to provide insight into group-wide understand-  138    Figure 1: Response System Framework  ing. Utilizing the spatial arrangement of artifacts across all participants, we classify artifacts into groups and produce several high level visualizations of the underlying data.  2. PROBLEM OF PRACTICE Audience Response Systems are popular for their ability to quickly give the teacher a high level overview of student un- derstanding [7]. Colloquially referred to as clickers, they excel at identifying the distribution of responses. The rep- resentation they produce, the bar chart, is easy to interpret. Many practitioners find the feedback from these systems use- ful in their teaching, especially when utilizing peer instruc- tion [5].  The main drawback is that audience response systems only work with multiple choice questions (MCQ). Many have noted the limitations of multiple choice questions in assess- ment, including the influence of guessing [1] and the need for a large and well-tested question bank [15].  After analyzing the current state of audience response sys- tems, we identified two main concepts that were crucial to their success which we intent to leverage in our work:  1. Mechanical Evaluation - Individual responses can be evaluated without a judgment intervention by a human  2. Ease of Visualization - The standard bar chart is sim- ple for a wide range of users to understand  We propose the Response System Framework pipeline (see Figure 1) for capturing and processing participant input. This framework is flexible enough to incorporate current MCQ systems as well as new forms of input that generate increasingly complex forms of data.  First, determine the type of question a teacher wants to ask and the type of data that it will produce. The system must transform each response into a mathematical representation and store the results of all participants. Using the informa- tion from the entire group, analyze the data and produce an abstracted representation which captures elements of all participants. Finally, create an abstracted visualization of the information in a meaningful way that allows teachers (and students) to easily interpret the results and act upon them.  2.1 Metacognitive Reflection The Next Generation Science Standards [10] encourage the instruction of authentic scientific practices, with a focus on activities that promote skills related to analyzing and inter- preting data from multiple sources and identifying patterns between them. We propose a pedagogical change, facilitated  by technology, that engages students in metacognitive reflec- tion and encourages them to interact with their peers ideas by grouping similar artifacts together.  Our classification algorithm (detailed in Section 4) leverages class-wide spatial arrangement meta-data, with a high level flow diagram depicted in Figure 2.  1. Students submit an artifact in response to a prompt, ideally an open ended conceptual question where there isnt just a single correct answer  2. Students analyze the artifacts of their peers and ar- range them spatially, grouping artifacts they deem sim- ilar closer together  3. The algorithm takes each spatial arrangement gener- ated by the class and determines the number of groups students have identified. The number of clusters can also be manually specified.  4. Groupings are visualized, either as a list or graph  5. The teacher uses the groupings to drive a classroom discussion by pointing out differences or similarities between the different clusters  Figure 2: High Level Flow of Algorithm  This process is also captured by our Response System Frame- work, with the steps shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3: Spatial Classification Framework  3. EXPERIMENT 3.1 Context  139    InterLACE (https://int.erlace.com) is a newly developed com- puter supported collaborative learning system designed for use in the modern classroom [4]. A full description is outside the scope of this paper, but one feature that InterLACE af- fords is a whiteboard like collaboration space, which allows users to physically arrange individual ideas on the screen in two dimensions. When student save their arrangement, they are required to reflect on how they arranged the artifacts. Other participants can see the annotation, and load their peers arrangement for inspection. Users noted that this af- fordance helped them organize their thoughts and group ideas together. They were applying the Gestalt theory of proximity to objects they deemed similar, and moved them closer together on the screen to express this equality.  This observation sparked the idea that it might be possi- ble to capture the semantic intent of multiple users spa- tial arrangement, creating a group-wide distance function between each pair of ideas. Would it be possible to use multiple users spatial arrangement metadata to generate an abstracted view of the original data  3.2 Methods Data was collected in a high school physics classroom that was beginning a unit on analyzing graphs. The teacher gave an open ended task of creating a graph that a real function might make. This activity was performed in 3 sections with a total of 72 students, producing 80 different graphs and 70 save arrangement events. InterLACE is designed to allow the same activity to be run across multiple sections, however students only see posts for their section. We will examine the data of one section in detail, which contained 24 students working in pairs and 23 save arrangement events.  Figure 4 shows a saved arrangement for the creation of posi- tion verses time graphs, with the annotation the first group went away from the origin and then came back. The second group all had times where the object was at rest and the last graph is not a function.  3.3 Algorithm Collaborative Spatial Classification takes as input the set of saved arrangements for an entire class, which for each student contains the (x,y) coordinates of each artifact on the screen.  The first step is to calculate average euclidean distance be- tween every pair of artifacts, across all participants, shown in Algorithm 1, lines 3-9. This creates a cumulative distance table measured in pixels, which represents an undirected, fully connected graph between all artifacts. Kruskals algo- rithm [16] creates a minimum spanning tree, line 13, joining all artifacts with the least cost, where cost is measured in distance.  If a user has specified the number of clusters they want (num), the algorithm simply removes the num-1 longest edges in the minimum spanning tree. If no number was specified, it attempts to determine the number of clusters by removing any edge with a distance longer than two times the standard deviation (lines 16-25).  The end results is a sparse graph, with num groups and  Figure 4: Student Arrangement  num-1 edges. Nodes that exist in the same tree are consid- ered to be part of the same group.  4. RESULTS 4.1 Visualizations The simplicity of data visualization in traditional clicker sys- tems was identified as an important design principle. There- fore one representation should be as simple as possible, with the goal of accessibility trumping other attributes.  The List View can be seen in Figure 5, which shows the calculated groupings from our classification algorithm run on the classroom data. The percentage in the header of each grouping is the number of artifacts that fall into that group.  In this instance, the algorithm automatically determined that there were three separate groups. The first set ap- pears quasi-linear, with instances where velocity is zero (the position line is flat). The largest set at 42% of responses, are graphs that are parabolic in nature. The final grouping are wave function graphs. The list view provides both struc- ture and summary level information about the distribution of ideas in the classroom.  One drawback of a list view is that it fails to convey any sense of relative distance. For example, even though two ar-  140    Data: X = Collection of size n participants of object A = (x,y) screen coordinates for each post  Result: Undirected Sparse Graph G  initialization1 Let Y [][] = Table holding cumulative pairwise distance33 for x  X do4  for i = 1 to n do5 for j = i+1 to n do6  Y [i][j] += EuclideanDistance(x[i], x[j]);7 end8  end9  end10 G = Kruskal(Y )1212   = Calculate standard deviation of edge length in G1414  if num is set then15 /* Create num clusters */ Pop the longest num-1 edges from G1717  else18 /* Calculate how many clusters to create */  for e  G[E] do19 if e > 2 then20  Remove e from G21 end22  end23  end24 Algorithm 1: Collaborative Spatial Classification(X, num)  tifacts are determined to be in the same group, their relative distance may still be quite far. This could be the result of limitations to the clustering algorighm, or a user manually specifying fewer groups than exist.  The Graph View encodes the relative distance between each artifact as the length of the edge between them (Figure 6). Tightly clustered items are more similar than items that have long edges between them. For illustrative purposes a separate dataset that is purely text is used in Figure 6, as the graph images had a tendancy to obscure some of the graph edges.  4.2 Teacher Feedback The most challenging aspect to getting feedback on the vi- sualizations was explaining to teachers what the data rep- resented, which may imply that the visualization was too complex. We feel this is a major barrier to increased use and acceptance of advanced analytics in the classroom, and certainly not unique to our implementation.  The most effective method was a short description supported by the high level overview (Figure 2), where the students arrangements went into a black box and out came a list. They seemed to grasp for concepts related to the average arrangement, which is conceptually close enough for our pur- poses.  This challenge has opened our eyes to the fact that re- searchers need to be acutely aware of the best ways to con- vey their results to practitioners. The success of your work is potentially less dependent on the complexity of your al-  Figure 5: List View  Figure 6: Graph Cluster View - Text  gorithm, and more dependent on how you frame the output and design interventions that best take advantage of the af- fordance.  Three teachers used grouping of artifacts as part of an ac- tivity. The visualizations were created after the fact and discussed separately with the teachers. In general, they re- sponded positively to the automated grouping and summa- tive information. They all agreed that the process of having students engage with each others ideas and find patterns in the data was beneficial.  Their interpretations of the visualization varied. The list view was identified as easy to read and providing useful in- formation about idea distribution. The graph view was a point of confusion, as the groups were difficult to identify, and the goal of encoding relative distance within the visual- ization had little added benefit to the teachers.  141    4.3 Future Work A more strictly scaffolded activity could potentially provide better results for automated grouping. For instance, provide in the prompt Group the posts according to slope (positive, negative, zero).  Cluster evaluation techniques such as the Rand Index [11] could be applied between students to identify which artifacts are most commonly present in different groupings. Addi- tional metadata is captured during the process of sorting, and leveraging information such as how many times each artifact was moved could provide deeper insight into the process of arrangement. Both could give the teacher addi- tional information in real time of which ideas the students were unsure.  Assessment support based on spatial grouping is also of in- terest. If the teacher provdies a ground truth arrangement, it becomes possible to train a classifier on that input by copying and slightly manipulating this representation. Us- ing this trained classifer on student responses could provide a quick way of identifying student input that is likely correct.  5. CONCLUSION As the capabilities of the technology inside the classroom im- prove, the complexity of the data students generate dramat- ically increases. Purely computational techniques to make sense of the dynamic creation of artifacts and interactions lack the flexibility to work on multi-modal representations. By leveraging a user-interaction driven method of concept classification, we are able to generate summary level infor- mation about idea distribution, allowing teachers to adjust their teaching in real time. Including students as part of the sensemaking process has a two-fold benefit. First, students engage with their peers ideas and work to identify patterns in the data, as prescribed by the Next Generation Science Standards. Second, the meta-data they produce as they ar- ticulate connections between ideas can be leveraged to create high level abstractions of the data. The techniques intro- duced could be extended to other complex forms of inter- action data generated in the classroom. Finally, researchers must strive to make the results of our work more accessible to practitioners by ensuring that our methods are clearly communicated using easily understood constructs.  6.

INTRODUCTION Analytics could be applied at very different levels in an ed-  ucational institution. Siemens and Long [18] seminally clas- sified the scope of analysis into five levels: Course, Depart- mental, Institutional, Regional and National/International. The first two levels are the main focus of Learning Analyt- ics, while the remaining three are usually called Academic Analytics [4]. Due to this distinction, most of previous re- search in Learning Analytics [9] deal only with the first level: the analysis of the behavior and interaction of students and faculty inside a course. Apart from studies of dropout [24], there is very little research on how to analyze the learning process at Departmental or Program level in order to guide the design or re-design of a program curriculum.

To bootstrap the discussion of this also important level, this work proposes a simple set of Learning Analytics tech- niques that could help program coordinators or faculty groups to gain a better insight on the nature and current perfor- mance of their programs and provide insights on possible problems or difficulties that the students may have with it. Such techniques could be useful for what we call Data- Driven Curriculum Analysis. These techniques are designed to work exclusively with readily available academic perfor- mance date (final grades) to facilitate its immediate adop- tion in a widely variety of institutions. To validate the use- fulness of the techniques, they are showcased in a case study involving at least 12 years of academic data of a particular Computer Science program that is being re-designed. The techniques, however, could be applied to any existing cur- riculum.  The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the related work on curriculum design techniques. Section 3 provides details on the context and data used as case study. Section 4 describes a technique to establish the actual difficulty of course based on the value and distribu- tion of grades. Section 5 provides a correlation analysis to determine the dependence between courses. Section 6 pro- poses the use of Exploratory Factor Analysis to find the un- derlying structure and coherence of the curriculum. Section 7 identifies problematic courses that could lead to student dropout. Section 8 analyzes the performance of the students under different academic loads, in order to recommend the number of courses per semester. Finally, Section 9 draws conclusions from the analysis performed and the recommen- dations for the re-design of the program in the case study.  2. RELATED WORK Curriculum analysis and design is a process that follows  generally the following systematic approach: precise identifi- cation of the curricular design specifications and constraints (student outcomes, competences, learning goals); identifica- tion of a curricular conceptual model (research based learn- ing, inquiry learning, problem based learning, case based learning, etc.); developing and testing of the curricular de- sign; and refining the design with the feedback of students and stakeholders [15]. Due to the nature of the design process, some of its components can be revisited after sev- eral iterations. A key component in this process is the es- tablishment of the conceptual model, which is related to: instructional contexts that are needed to be emphasized, teaching/learning methods, resources, etc. Many studies are mainly devoted to study the effects of some components of  148    a curricular conceptual model or the innovation of teach- ing strategies in the curriculum [15, 7, 23], but few of them examine their curriculum in order to base their redesign de- cisions on data of the corresponding academic program.  One example of an attempt to a data-driven curriculum redesign is what Sundermand and Price conduct in the cur- riculum incubator [20]. In their work, they experimented with teaching strategies, learned from them and introduced curricular modifications but mainly at the course level. Al- bert [1] states, from the medical education point of view, that most of the decisions related to curriculum and teach- ing are based on opinions, intuitions, and personal pref- erences; thus, she presents a curriculum for new rheuma- tology trainees that is based on trends that appeared af- ter analyzing clinical problems that had the greatest educa- tional relevance in the rheumatology field. In this case, the decision-making process about the curriculum was mostly based on teaching experiences of relevant educational pieces. Nonetheless, and despite these efforts, no studies present the analytical approach that is presented in this research. It was not found any literature that offers a varied set of techniques to identify difficult courses and their impact on GPA or de- sertion in a program, as the techniques presented in this article.  3. CASE STUDY The data analyzed in this article consists on the aca-  demic performance information of Computer Science (CS) undergraduate students from the Electrical and Comput- ing Engineering College of ESPOL University in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The dataset spans the academic history from 1978 up to 2012 and is composed by the grades of 2543 individ- uals that eventually enrolled in the CS program of ESPOL. The name of the ESPOL CS program has changed over time: 1) Electrical Engineering with a minor in Comput- ing, 2) Computer Engineering, and 3) Computer Science. The two later degrees compose the most recent history of the investigated time interval and have been offered in three different concentrations or majors: a) Multimedia Systems, b) Technological Systems, and c) Information Systems.  According to the performance scoring system of ESPOL, a class grade can take a real value from the interval [0.00, 10.00] and a student passes a given class by obtaining a grade equal or greater than 6.00, otherwise he/she fails. The gen- eral CS curriculum categorizes its courses according to the topics and contents they cover in: 1) Basic Sciences, 2) Hu- manities, and 3) Professional Training courses . Moreover, each CS profile has its own concentration courses and con- tains several both selective and elective credits.  At ESPOL, students are allowed to adjust the number of courses they want to take within the selective elective and free-selective categories, according to the amount of credits they accumulate throughout their degree. Therefore, some students may complete the specified number of credits for these categories with more (or fewer) courses than others. Because of this, the entire academic history generated by the students considered in this analysis defined a huge set of unique courses. The heterogeneity of this set is not only ex- plained by the diversification introduced by each programs majors and their selective elective and free-selective courses, but also by the curricular modifications that were performed on the CS programs during the time interval considered.  In order to prepare such varied data for a proper anal-  ysis, a few processing steps were performed on the origi- nal dataset to clean it properly. First, we dealt with any missing information introduced by curricular modifications. Some of these changes include 1) Courses that were removed from some versions of the curricula, 2) Courses whose type was changed from compulsory to elective, 3) Courses that were split into more than one courses, 4) Courses whose names were modified.To cope with these events, a course- course matching process was conducted to determine the agreements among two or more distinct courses that can be considered equivalent across different versions of the curricu- lum. At the end of this course-matching process, the set of unique courses was slightly reduced but it still contained a considerable amount of missing grading information.  To reduce the amount of missing data, we discarded in our analysis courses not highly frequently chosen by students and English courses that escape from the conceptual design of CS. With this step, we selected a common core of 27 classes for which grading information was readily available. The set of courses included in the last version of the dataset is illustrated in Figure 1. This set is composed by 8 basic sciences courses, 16 on professional instruction and 3 from the humanities category.  For some analysis, due to discontinuities in the data due to program changes, only the last 12 years, where the cur- riculum has stayed fairly static, were used to avoid the in- troduction of noise.

DIFFICULTY ESTIMATION When looking at the difficulty levels of the courses they  are composed of, curricula constitute very diverse sets. In particular for CS, given the varied nature of the knowledge areas involved in the professional training process of com- puter scientists, courses may exhibit distinct difficulty levels.  149    The objective characterization of courses in terms of their difficulty is not a trivial task. Factors such as instructors particular characteristics, students affinity with the course concepts, or grading stringency standards applied are the causes why the computation of a single value to represent the difficulty level of a course is not an easy problem. In this regard, the number of credits contributed by a course within a curriculum is normally considered as a difficulty indicator because it is intended to suggest the work and time loads that students are supposed to experience in a certain period of time (a week, for example) to successfully pass a given class. However, the credit system overlooks other factors that are not necessarily related to time and effort. Spe- cial considerations such as extracurricular activities, other courses taken at the same time, and aspects not related to the academic life, can make a course easier or harder inde- pendently of its number of credits.  The historical average grade of a course j, denoted here as HAGj and defined according to Equation 1, where rij is the grade obtained by the student i in course j and N js is the total number of students that have taken the class j, might be the most basic data-inspired indicator that comes to mind when searching for objective estimators of difficulty. However, HAG not only can be also biased by the factors mentioned above, but it also ignores the overall academic performance of students that generated the grades involved in its computation. Thus, this value is not suitable to sug- gest, for example, whether a course rated as easy was easy because it was always taken by high-performing students or because its contents were not challenging enough in such a way that even low-performing students got high grades.  HAGj =   i  rij  N js (1)  In this section, we propose a technique to compute em- pirical, data-based, courses difficulty estimators for courses of an actual CS curriculum. We also apply two of the ap- proaches suggested in [5] to estimate courses difficulty levels and their corresponding grading stringency indices. Then, we compare these indicators with the results of a percep- tion study that measured the opinion of students about the difficulty of courses, impact of courses grades on GPA, and importance of some courses to continue in the program.  4.1 Description The influence of a course on a students academic his-  tory is related to which extent it contributes positively or negatively to the students overall performance. If the grade point average (GPA) is considered as a general performance indicator, a course contribution can be seen as positive or negative according to whether the grade obtained on it is greater or lower, respectively, than the studentsGPA. Thus, the distance between the GPA and a particular course grade can be seen as a measure of how much that class shifted, up or down, the students GPA. That is, how much the given course move students away from their GPA or bring them closer to it.  In order to characterize the difficulty of a course we pro- pose to construct a statistical distribution of the distances between the GPAs of all the students that took the given course and the grades they got on it. Examples of these distributions are shown in Figure 2 for two courses of the ESPOL CS curriculum: Algorithms Analysis (Figure 2a)  and the Oral and Written Communication Techniques and Research course (Figure 2b).  3  mean: 0.6270042 skewness: -0.7813815    2 1 0 1 2 3  0. 0  0. 2  0. 4  0. 6  0. 8  1. 0  (a) Algorithms Analysis  3 2 1 0 1 2 3 0.  0 0.  2 0.  4 0.  6 0.  8 1.  0  mean: -0.666954 skewness: 0.1693253    (b) Oral and Written Communication Techniques  Figure 2: GPA - course grade distances distribution for two courses from the ESPOL CS curriculum  As it can be observed the shapes of these two distribu- tions (shown in red) differ significantly in the longitude and leaning of their longer tail. In the case of Algorithm Analy- sis, the mass of the distribution is concentrated to the right of the figure, which means a negative skewness. On the contrary, values for the Oral and Written Communication Techniques and Research course are consolidated to the left side of the distribution mean, which leads to a positive skew- ness distribution. The skewness values for the distribution computed from the differences between the students GPA and their course grades, are always related to whether the course grades have been greater or lower than the GPAs of the students involved. In that sense, the distribution skew- ness can be considered as a difficulty indicator of a course. Thus, The more negative the skewness, the more difficult the course is.  Caulkins et. al. [5] propose that a course j has a grading stringency index j and multiplicative magnitude j that represents its difficulty level. These two values are computed according to Equations 2 and 3, respectively. In these equa- tions, GPAi represents the overall academic performance of student i and rij and N  j s are defined as explained above.  j =   i  GPAi 2  i  (rij GPAi) (2)  j =   i  (GPAi  rij)  N js (3)  150    Note that the equation for the  values include the dis- tance between the GPA and the course grade of students (GPAi  rij) on which we based the skewness distribution computation. Thus, the grading stringency standard is also an indicator of how much a course moves the students GPA. The use of the skewness however, also takes into account the shape of the distribution of grades.  4.2 Application The three approaches detailed in section 4.1 were applied  over the courses that compose the curriculum show in Fig- ure 1. Table 1 details these three magnitudes for the 27 courses, which have been ordered by their distribution skew- ness value.  Parallel to these computations, a perception study was conducted with 80 students of the CS program. The per- ceptions about the following courses characteristics were gathered using a survey: difficulty level, negative impact on GPA, and importance in the program. The survey included questions that asked the student to identify a maximum of six courses that were considered: difficult, with a high fail- ure rate, and important to continue the CS program. De- scriptive results of this survey are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, courses like Operating Systems, Programming Fundamentals, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Struc- tures, among others, are perceived either difficult and/or negatively related on the GPA of a student, coinciding with what appears in Table 1. In addition, the importance of a course to continue in the CS program was identified by stu- dents. The following are the courses that appeared between 10% to 50% of the times as important courses to continue in the CS program: Physics A (10%), Electrical Networks Systems I (10%), Research Methods Applied to Comput- ing (11%), Physics C (14%), Differential Calculus (15%), Statistics (18%), Programming Languages (23%), Differen- tial Equations (24%), Operating Systems (30%), Linear Al- gebra (46%), Programming Fundamentals (50%). These courses importance indicators will be used to contrast the findings in section 7.  0%  5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  35%  Perceived Negative Impact over GPA  Peceived Difficulty  Figure 3: Students perceptions about difficulty and negative impact of courses on their GPA  The results obtained through the three approaches pre- sented above were contrasted with students perceptions about the level of difficulty and negative impact of courses in their  GPAs. It was found that the majority of the courses that had a negative skewness, higher Alpha and Beta values are also perceived as courses with high level of difficulty and a negative impact on the overall GPA of students, once they are approved. These findings might be useful for faculty members in planning, for example, the split of some courses into others or the inclusion of teaching/learning strategies that help students to reach better scores from (difficult) courses. Curriculum design is a process that goes from set- ting student outcomes, that must be achieved at the end of a program, to guaranteeing that these outcomes are actually developed and met [10]. As such, when designing curricu- lum, data-evidences are key inputs of the implicit decision making process that is conducted. Finally, it is important to note that these measurements of difficulty are averaged among different instructors with different methodologies and grading stringency. Obtaining these values for pairs Course- Instructor should provide a more reliable estimate of the real difficulty.  5. DEPENDANCE ESTIMATION Curricula for undergraduate programs are normally struc-  tured in such a way that their courses are not totally in- dependent from each other. That is, concepts reviewed in advanced courses commonly depend on the contents covered previously, in other basic courses. This pre-requisite based system causes that students follow a logical sequences that guarantee that the contents associated to specific concepts or Knowledge Areas are covered incrementally. Based on this fact, this section presents a simple correlational analy- sis as a measurement of the inter-course dependance within a curriculum.  5.1 Description As a simple measurement of the dependance degree, a  Pearsons correlation coefficient could be applied to the fi- nal grades to estimate the linear relationship between the students academic performance on each pair of courses in a curriculum. We propose this technique under the assump- tion that the contents of certain courses are of higher impor- tance for other subsequent subjects than others. Consider, for instance, that the contents covered on the Differential Calculus course are the base over which the Integral Cal- culus topics are developed. Under this hypothesis, we are supposed to find a strong correlation on the performance of a student taking the Integral Calculus course and the perfor- mance he/she obtained on the corresponding pre-requisite.  5.2 Application The correlation analysis was applied to the core courses of  the ESPOL CS curriculum. The results of these computa- tions are shown in the color-map of Figure 4. The correlation degree between two courses are represented by the color of the corresponding cell: high correlation values are shown in dark colors and lower values are shown in white tones.  As it can be observed, the correlation values found in this part of the alaysis are not specially high among most of the courses. This fact suggests that the inter-course de- pendances within the curriculum analyzed are not strong. The three highest Pearsons correlation coefficients of the depicted map occurs for the Computers and Society course when is observed with: 1) Human-Computer Interaction (0.6226), 2) Discrete Mathematics (0.614), and 3) the Op-  151    Table 1: Skewness values for some GPA-course grades distances distributions  # Course skewness   1 Algorithms Analysis -0.7814 1.1435 1.0791 2 Operating Systems -0.7751 1.0891 0.7334 3 Programming Fundamentals -0.7620 1.3458 2.0529 4 Object-Oriented Programming -0.7282 1.2001 1.3907 5 Data Structures -0.7118 1.1452 1.1113 6 Digital Systems I -0.7042 1.1912 1.3570 7 Electrical Networks I -0.6992 1.2300 1.4962 8 Programming Languages -0.6841 1.2032 1.4374 9 Discrete Mathematics -0.6799 1.1503 1.1343 10 Economic Engineering I -0.6705 1.1426 1.0519 11 Multivariate Calculus -0.6107 1.2126 1.4332 12 Integral Calculus -0.6005 1.2026 1.3283 13 Differential Calculus -0.5978 1.2842 1.7069 14 Statistics -0.5912 1.2519 1.7823 15 Artificial Intelligence -0.5793 1.1214 0.9268 16 Linear Algebra -0.5494 1.3042 1.8891 17 Software Engineering I -0.5385 0.9891 -0.0499 18 Physics A -0.5310 1.2302 2.4057 19 Differential Equations -0.5244 1.3066 1.8509 20 General Chemistry -0.4212 1.1108 1.2535 21 Computers and Society -0.3889 1.0895 0.6651 22 Human-Computer Interaction -0.3859 1.0396 0.3970 23 Databases Systems I -0.3680 1.1201 0.8373 24 Software Engineering II -0.2021 0.9742 -0.1283 25 Ecology and Environmental Education -0.1473 1.0061 0.2150 26 Computers Architecture and Organization 0.0009 0.9750 -0.1167 27 Oral and Written Comm.

However, the con- tents reviewed on this class constitute the most basic CS topics that students are exposed to at the very beginning of their academic path. Also important to note is that the performance of the students in Programming Fundamentals, one of the most difficult initial courses, has very little corre- lation with their performance in any other course. It seems that the level of stringency in this course is much higher than needed, as obtaining a high or low grade does not heavily influence the further achievements in the program.  De Koning et al. [6] carried out a study for a three-year bachelor program and concluded that predictors of first-year courses were not the same predictors for subsequent years, even though they also affirm that prior grades and learning activities were strong and stable predictors. Despite cogni- tive skills and previous knowledge of students are important predictors of achievement, recently, affective variables like: motivation, self-drive, dedication time, learning preferences, among the most important ones, have been identified as im- portant as those linked to scores [19, 3]. We have found no significant correlations between the scores reached in pre- requisite courses and their subsequent courses; thus, in our case other factors have to be explored and studied to predict students achievement.  6.

Courses appear codified according to Table 1  by the completion of their degrees, several logically inter- related outcomes or competences. Several curricular guide- lines for undergraduate programs in computing, such as the proposed by the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, nor- mally define a Body of Knowledge (BoK) to cover the CS professional domain according to the desired competences of their future graduated students. In such guidelines, a BoK  152    is organized in several Knowledge Areas (KAs) which are further composed by various Knowledge Units (KUs) that ultimately constitute the building blocks of the courses in- cluded in a curriculum.  In this work, we hypothesize that when a curriculum is co- herent, it should mask, somehow, an underlying structure of courses grouping together in sets of courses that cover con- cepts associated to several interrelated professional compe- tences. Moreover, we believe that such grouping should re- veal the level at which a set of courses are coherently aligned with the learning outcomes aimed by a given curricular de- sign.  In this section, we propose the use of Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) as a technique to reveal the grouping course structures hidden underneath a curricular design.  6.1 Description The goal of EFA is to uncover the underlying structure of  a relatively large set of variables by identifying interrelation- ships among them. This technique is of special usefulness to discover which variables in the set form coherent subsets that are relatively independent of one another [21]. It out- puts several unobserved latent variables, known as factors, that summarize patterns of correlation among the observed variables. These factors are thought to reflect the underly- ing processes that have created the correlations among the observed input variables.  The hypothesis behind the use of EFA in the context of the academic performance achieved by students who enroll in the courses that compose a specific curriculum can be stated as follows: Several individual variables (in this case, the grades obtained by the students in each of the analyzed courses) combine with the grades of some other courses to form factors that represent the big areas of the students professional training process.  6.2 Application In this part, we based our analysis on the academic per-  formance of the last six generations of CS undergraduate students who successfully completed their degree at ESPOL between 2000 and 2012. A maximum-likelihood factor anal- ysis was performed on the correlation matrix of the dataset composed by the performance achieved by 333 students on each of the 27 courses shown in Figure 1. The analysis was executed by using the functionalities provided by the psych statistical package1 available for the R statistical software [16]. A varimax rotation was applied on the first version of the loadings matrix resulting from the initial extraction of factors.  From the 27 factors, The first six had eigenvalues greater than 1. We investigated the cumulative variance that can be captured from the dataset by executing the EFA with 5, 6 and 7 factors. The values found for this parameter in the three tests were 33, 36 and 37 percent, respectively. More- over, in each analysis, a hypothesis test was conducted to measure whether each amount of factors was sufficient. The p value for the three tests were 0.0827, 0.284 and 0.541, re- spectively. Since the idea of Factor Analysis is to summarize the patterns of correlations with as few factors as possible, five factors were selected.  The groups of courses included in the five factors found in our analysis are shown in Figure 5. These set of courses re-  1http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html  Table 2: Factors summed squared loadings and vari- ances  Factors 1 2 3 4 5  SS loadings 2.82 1.99 1.55 1.33 0.98 Proportion Var 0.11 0.08 0.06 0.05 0.04 Cumulative Var 0.11 0.18 0.24 0.3 0.33  sult after the application of a cutoff value of 0.3 on the load- ings matrix of the orthogonally-rotated factors.

As mentioned before, the five factors capture a cumulative variance of 0.33. That is, together, they account for 33% of the variance present in the 27 per- formance scores.

Following, we provide the interpretations of each factor found according to the known characteristics of the analyzed curricular design.  Factor 1 (The basic training factor): Elements in this group can be classified in two categories: Basic science courses, and fundamental CS courses. The first category cover topics aimed the understanding of abstract ideas and  153    Differential and Integral Calculus Linear Algebra  Multivariate Calculus Digital Systems I  Basic Physics Porgramming Fundamentals  Discrete Mathematics General Chemistry  Statistics Data Structures  Computing and Society Algorithms Analysis  Differential Equations Ecology and Environmental Education  Object-Oriented Programming  Factor1Classes 0.57 0.48 0.47 0.47 0.45 0.42 0.41 0.38 0.38 0.37 0.36 0.35 0.33 0.33 0.31  Factor2 Artificial Intelligence 0.65  Operative Systems 0.62 Software Engineering I 0.36  Object-Oriented Programming 0.34 Economic Engineering 0.34  Hardware Architectures 0.34 Database Systems 0.33 Digital Systems I 0.31  Human-Computer Interaction 0.31  Classes  Factor3 Software Engineering II 0.68 Software Engineering I 0.59  Human-Computer Interaction 0.43 Oral and Written Communication Techniques 0.36  General Chemistry 0.34  Classes  Factor4 Programming Languages 0.73  Object-Oriented Programming 0.42 Data Structures 0.33  Classes Factor5  Electrical Networks 0.57 Differential Equations 0.43  Classes  Figure 5: Factors and variable-factors correlations grouped after applying a cutoff of 0.3  concepts. These abstractions lie at several levels: mathe- matical (Calculus and Linear Algebra), logical (Digital Sys- tems), natural phenomena (Chemistry, Physics, Ecology and Environmental Education) and data interpretation (Statis- tics).  On the other hand, the second category groups funda- mental CS courses. Computers and Society, Programming Fundamentals, Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis are the first set of courses of the CS program offered to students. In particular, the Discrete Mathematics course is a good ex- ample of a subject in which mathematical abstractions are thought with a focus strongly oriented to computing appli- cations.  Four of the courses included in Factor 1 are also correlated at a considerable level with some other factors. The anal- ysis of the following factors will provide the corresponding interpretations of these shared correlations.  Factor 2 (The advanced CS topics factor): With the exception of the Economic Engineering I course, all the subjects in this group cover advanced, high-level CS topics. This group includes courses related to the design of Database Systems, the study of Computers Architecture and Organi- zation, Object-Oriented Programming, Software Engineer- ing, Human Computer Interaction, Digital Systems, Artifi- cial Intelligence, and Operating Systems. In general, these courses refer to the identification of a systems components and their interrelationships. The only course that seems to be misplaced in this subset is the Economic Engineering class.  Factor 3 (The client interaction factor): This fac- tor seems to cover aspects related to communication skills needed to deal with final users and stakeholders involved in the software developing process. In that sense, it includes the Oral and Written Communication Techniques and Re- search course and other courses that are also correlated with Factor 2. More specifically, these courses are mainly related to the software building process and interaction with clients and final users. In this point, it is important to mention that most of these courses (with the exception of General  Chemistry) are organized in ESPOL in such a way that stu- dents do have actual clients for which they have to develop functional software projects during the class. Thus, it is comprehensible that, besides being part of the advanced CS topics factor, they share correlation with Factor 3.  Factor 4 (The programming factor): The courses grouped under this factor constitute those exclusively ded- icated to develop programming skills and abstraction con- ceptualizations. These courses are, in the curricular design of the ESPOL CS program, in what is called the programing sequence of the curriculum. The concepts covered by all of these courses are related to programming skills.  Factor 5: This group seems to include courses that can- not be grouped with any other of the CS curriculum. It is interesting to see that, these courses are more linked to electrical engineering courses, which were included in the curriculum as a requisite of the college (Electrical and Com- puter Engineering). These courses are commonly seen by students as subjects that do not fit in their degree because are not directly applied to solving problems related to CS.  The main conclusion of the curriculum coherence analy- sis conducted in this section is that it allows us to identify which courses of a curricular design form logical structures aimed to develop interrelated professional competences. To confirm the soundness of the found groups, additional EFAs could be performed on other type of data related to the courses that compose a curriculum. For instance, instead of considering the students academic performance informa- tion, we might consider the distances between each class grade obtained by the students and their GPA.  It has to be said that a very important component of this analysis is the interpretation of the factors output by the EFA. Coherence requires subjective judgment and that can be done only when the context on which the curriculum takes place is very well known. This implies that all the identified structures have to be further analyzed by human evaluators with a deep understanding of the nature of the program and its particularities in order to see the logic be- hind the discovered grouping structures. In any case, having  154    an objective statistical method over which a judgment can be done is a positive starting point to take decisions on the curricular design within academic institutions.  Regarding the case study, the results suggest that some courses do not align with the main CS competences factors (Differential Equations and Electric Networks). This result, together with the knowledge that these courses were initially considered only because they were part of the Electrical En- gineering curriculum, should spark a discussion about their real importance in the CS curriculum. Also, it was sur- prising to find that Programming Fundamentals is not con- sidered in the programming factor (factor 4). This result, linked with the previous result of the lack of correlation be- tween grades of Programming Fundamentals with the rest of the programming courses, warranty a deeper qualitative analysis of the content and methodologies of this course.  7. DROPOUT AND ENROLLING PATHS In this study, academic dropout is defined as a student  who enrolled in an academic program that eventually, at some point before completing the corresponding degree, per- manently abandoned it. This type of academic desertion has been widely investigated for several decades in works mainly oriented to explain its causes. Factors such as race and gen- der [11], socio-economic and family backgrounds [17], stu- dents engagement with school activities [2], extracurricu- lar load [12], and the like, have been repeatedly explored not only to explain dropout but also to construct predictive models for the early detection of potential desertion scenar- ios.  However, no works have been conducted to explore the existence of relationships, if any, between dropouts and cur- ricular designs. This section proposes the use of frequent sequence analysis as a technique to answer the following question: Are there any frequent enrolling paths followed by students within a curriculum that lead to dropout settings If so, to which extent a given enrolling path is frequently ob- served as a previous necessary condition for desertions Our analysis refers to an enrolling path as a specific sequence of courses taken (or failed) by a student along his/her academic history. Following section explains the theoretical motiva- tions for the application of sequence mining and details how it can be used to track students enrolling patterns that lead them to quit their academic programs.  7.1 Description The goal of sequence mining is to discover sequential pat-  terns of frequently repeated events in a given database of temporal transactions [13]. Among many others, scenar- ios where this type of mining task has been used include: sales databases of items bought by customers [8], analysis of users activity in web searching and browsing [14], and disease identification based on sequences of symptoms [22].  In sequence mining, frequent patterns are considered to emerge over time as the events that compose the sequences occur repeatedly. A sequence  is considered frequent if it is contained by a minimum number of input-sequences that form the database D. This minimum value is called the support or frequency of . To illustrate the concept of support, consider the scenario where a bookstore keeps his- torical record on the books bought by each of its customers. This information could be mined to find behavioural pat- terns in the users buying habits to predict, for example,  how likely is that a given customer that has bought book A eventually come back to buy book B, given that 80% of previous buyers of book A actually did so.  Considering that students academic history takes places over a period of time with very well known courses times- tamps, sequence mining techniques can be applied to find frequent patterns in the way students enroll in the courses that compose their programs curricula. More specifically, frequent sequence analysis can be conducted over the fail- ure segments of the students academic history to investigate whether particular failing course patterns conduct students to more dropout scenarios than others.  7.2 Application The failing academic events of 610 dropouts were inves-  tigated to find the most frequent courses and sequences of courses that were failed by students before abandoning their undergraduate studies. The analyzed subset was part of a greater cohort of 1591 students that enrolled at the CS program of ESPOL along the last twelve years (2000-2012). Thus, the original CS population evidences a dropout rate of 38.34%.  The SPADE algorithm [25], an approach for fast discovery of sequential patterns, was applied to the described subset of enrolling information using a minimum support of 0.3. The results of this algorithm are detailed in Table 3, which clearly shows that before deciding to quit, a large propor- tion of the investigated students failed courses on the ba- sic training levels of their curriculum (that is, courses from Factor 1 of section 6.3). These result implies that most of these students decided to dropout immediately after dealing with fundamental concepts related to general Science and Engineering. Among all these courses, the most frequent event associated with dropout is the failure of the Physics A course, which was failed by about 61% of the students that eventually left the CS program.  Since the investigated dropouts did not take place at ad- vanced levels or high phases of their academic history, stu- dents who abandoned the CS program did it without having the opportunity to interact with actual CS topics. The Pro- gramming Fundamentals course is the first CS course that is part of the more frequent steps previous to dropouts. It appears third in the list with a support of 0.53.  Results of the sequence mining performed are consistent with those obtained from the perception study described in section 4. Interestingly, the Physics A course is perceived as an important course that enables a student to continue the CS Program (10%) but not as important as the Pro- gramming Fundamentals course (50%). Therefore, failing such courses refrain students to continue in their CS edu- cation. Again, 6 out of 11 perceived important courses are from the basic sciences strand, these courses are mostly the same found in the set of courses of the failing enrolling path that lead to dropping out the CS Program. This appar- ent relationship can be interpreted as a good indicator of the importance given to them by students that eventually graduate.  This section proposed sequence mining for the identifica- tion of enrolling paths defined by students within a curricu- lum that frequently lead to dropouts scenarios. The identi- fication of these critical trajectories in curricular designs is of special importance when decisions have to be taken to re- duce or minimize the desertion rates. Finding critical paths  155    Table 3: Frequent failing enrolling paths that lead to dropout scenarios (Support = 0.3)  Sequence Support <{Physics A},{Dropout}> 0.608196721  <{Differential Calculus},{Dropout}> 0.570491803 <{Programming Fundamentals},{Dropout}> 0.532786885  <{Integral Calculus},{Dropout}> 0.496721311 <{Physics A, Differential Calculus},{Dropout}> 0.43442623  <{Linear Algebra},{Dropout}> 0.432786885 <{Differential Calculus,Integral Calculus},{Dropout}> 0.385245902  <{Physics C},{Dropout}> 0.347540984 <{Physics A,Integral Calculus},{Dropout}> 0.327868852  <{General Chemistry},{Dropout}> 0.319672131 <{Differential Equations},{Dropout}> 0.31147541  to avoid dropout and to reduce the negative impact of cer- tain courses in desertion rates is a key input for curricular design. Administrators, faculty members and curricular de- signers can take data-driven decisions and plan accordingly. Moreover, this technique can be also applied to academic events of other types, such as successful scenarios to detect enrolling paths that are more likely to conduct students to graduation.  8. LOAD/PERFORMANCE GRAPH The balance between academic load and academic per-  formance is of vital importance for students success. The achievement of an optimal trade-off between these two fac- tors is highly related to the curricular design in the sense that it defines (or, at least, suggests) the way in which stu- dents should enroll in the courses of their degrees. How courses are assigned to different levels, the established pre- requisites, and the list of possible optimal courses are some of the factors that influence the academic history of students of all levels. This implies that a good curricular design should seek the maximization of students academic performance at the same time that it properly manages their working load. Given this context, mechanisms to characterize the load ver- sus performance profile of a curriculum are highly desired. This section explains a technique to build such profiles by proposing some measurements for the load and performance magnitudes.  8.1 Description Academic load can be associated to several factors: 1) num-  ber of courses taken in a particular academic period, 2) to- tal difficulty pursued by the student, and 3) total grading stringency to which the student is subjected. On the other hand, performance can be seen in function of other several factors such as: 1) number of courses a student pass in a given academic period, 2) total courses difficulty achieved, and 3) total grading stringency of the courses the student managed to pass.  Constructing visualizations of the trajectories followed by students in the load/performance graph could provide cur- riculum designers with information about how well different students manage the recommended class load and what is the actual preferred load of different kind of students.  8.2 Application Figure 7 plots the density plot of the semestral load and  performance information for all the students of the investi-  gated dataset. Load is represented here by the difficulty of the courses taken by the student. On the other hand, per- formance is expressed in terms of the total difficulty of the passed courses. This graph represents the relation between the total difficulty achieved on a semester and the total dif- ficulty pursued on the same period of time. We calculated the total difficulty pursued by a student as the sum of the individual courses taking at a given academic period. Sim- ilarly, the total difficulty achieved is defined as the sum of the difficulties of the passed courses. Being a density plot, this graph shows how many times students had an specific value of in the load/performance plane.  Pursued Difficulty (Load)  Ac hi  ev ed   D iff  ic ul  ty  (P  er fo  rm an  ce )  0  2  4  6  8  0 2 4 6 8  level  0.000  0.025  0.050  0.075  0.100  0.125  0.150  0.175  0.200  Figure 7: Semestral load versus performance density plot  As it can be easily seen in the Figure 7, most students have a load around 4, 5 or 6 (darker tones). There is a fairly large population that usually achieve the pursued difficulty, that is, they approve all the courses that they take. There is also a noticeable population of students that usually fail 1 or 2 courses (dark spots under the diagonal), meaning that these students were taking more load than they could effectively manage. In the curriculum the recommended load is 6 courses. However, the largest population of students are not taking that load, but only 5 courses or even 4 courses. Even with that load, a fair amount of them is failing at least 1 course. It is clear that a more realistic recommended load of 5 courses (or 4 if a difficult course is taken) is more advisable for the students of this program.  156    9. CONCLUSIONS Historical academic performance data, while limited, pro-  vide an easy gateway to start conducting Learning Analytics studies on the characteristics and relation of diverse courses inside a program curriculum. The information that could be obtained, even with very simple techniques, could help faculty and institutional administrator to understand their programs beyond a merely theoretical viewpoint. The tech- niques presented in this work have the potential to start informed discussions inside faculty members that could lead to an improvement of the learning process of the student, not by changing particular aspects of a course, but deciding which courses are taught and in which sequence.  The application of these techniques to the case study has provided valuable information that will be used in an ex- pected re-design of the CS program at ESPOL. The difficulty estimation analysis suggests that some courses, in particular Programming Fundamentals, should be re-designed or even divided to reduce their complexity. The methodology and evaluation of others courses, such as Oral and Written Ex- pression and Research, should be reviewed to provide level of stringency closer to the mean. The dependence analysis highlighted the fact that current pre-requisites are not as im- portant as previously thought and that the performance of student in perceived difficult courses is not correlated with their performance in other courses, suggesting that a re- laxation of the difficulty of initial courses will not have a major impact further in the program. The curriculum co- herence analysis discovered that there are four major classes of courses in the program: Basic Concepts, Advanced CS concepts, Programming and Project/Client related. A fifth class, grouping the Electrical Engineering courses, seems to be disconnected from the overall flow of the program and should be considered for elimination. The dropout and en- rollment path analysis suggests that failing basic courses, not really related with CS, is one of the main indicators of fu- ture desertion. Maybe the curriculum re-design should pro- vide more core CS courses at the beginning of the program. Finally, the load/performance analysis indicates that the current workload is too heavy for the majority of students. A re-design should consider lowering the recommended load to 5 courses, while allowing high-performing students to ad- vance at a faster pace. All these recommendations should be evaluated by the program stakeholders in order to to provide the qualitative analysis needed to validate them.  Far from trying to be a comprehensive set of analytics tools for curriculum (re-)design, this work attempts to dis- cuss how very simple statistical and computational tech- niques could be applied to historic academic performance data to gain insight on possible problems or improvement opportunities in whole program curricula. Moreover, the real objective behind this research is to encourage other re- searchers to critique and improve over these simple tech- niques in order to extend the impact of Learning Analytics beyond the scope of individual courses.  10.

INTRODUCTION  The study was conducted within the framework of the Learning  Analytics Summer Institute (LASI) in Amsterdam, a strategic  two-days event (July 4 -5, 2013) co-organized by SoLAR and the  Dutch SURF Special Interest Group (SIG) on Learning Analytics.  The LASI event Amsterdam was part of a global network of 10  LASI events in various countries worldwide. The objectives of the  Dutch LASI was to stimulate cross-disciplinary interactions,  identify research and teaching needs, share best practices and   build community around the Learning Analytics (LA) and  Educational Data Mining (EDM) by involving various  stakeholders from educational science, data & computer science,  policy makers, and learning technology start-up companies. To  facilitate accomplishment of the LASI objectives a Group  Concept Mapping study was conducted. The intention was to go  beyond the-state-of-the-art of LA [1,2] and EDM [3,4], to identify  the potentials and risks of LA in the Netherlands and to project  the expectations of the LA stakeholders on the impact of LA on  the Dutch education system.    Most of the state-of-the-art publications indicate that LA & EDM  are a mean to get more advanced research methods for education.  The underlying assumption is that educators will be able to better  assess their pedagogical practices to improve education. The main  expectations towards LA could roughly be stated as follows:     Awareness and reflection support [4]    Improve educational decision-making and clearer goal  setting [5]    More timely and frequent feedback for students and  teachers [6]    Self-regulated and personalized learning [4,7]    Creation of richer learning (behavior) data to facilitate  educational research [8]   In addition, concerns have been expressed in the literature that  many recent LA technologies are detached from pedagogical  experiences and practices [4]. Various authors emphasize that LA  is more than a series of clicks and page visits, and that it needs to  support learners to gain better insights into their learning progress  [9]. With this background information in mind we had certain  expectations in regard to the outcomes of the Group Concept  Mapping (GCM) study:    1. The clusters depicted by the GCM study will be  comparable to the thematic areas described in current  state-of-the-art articles about LA.    2. There will be differences in the expectations of the  novices and the experts in the LASI event. The novice  participants would be more skeptical than the experts  about the benefits of LA and more concerned with the  potential risks caused by LA.    2.

Copyright 2014 ACM 978-1-4503-2664-3/14/03$15.00.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567574.2567617   158    Group Concept Mapping (GCM) is a research methodology that  facilitates a group of people to arrive at a shared vision about a  particular issue (e.g. the impact of LA on education). GCM differs  from other methods for collecting and analyzing opinions  (interviews, questionnaires, affinity diagram, delphi, collective  classical concept mapping) in three substantial ways. Firstly, it is  the participants, not the researchers who generate and structure  the ideas. Secondly, the methodology implements some advanced  multivariate statistics mainly Multidimensional scaling and  Hierarchical Cluster Analysis that objectively identity emerging  patterns in the data. Thirdly, the methodology presents the results  in visual formats (conceptual maps, pattern matches and go- zones) that are easy to grasp for further interpretation and  implementation into practice [9].    2.2 Procedure  The participants in the LASI event were introduced to GCM and  the kinds of outcomes they might expect. They were then invited  to visit an online environment based on Concept System Global  platform1 to brainstorm ideas on the impact of Learning Analytics  on the Dutch education completing the following focus prompt:    One specific change that Learning Analytics will trigger in  Dutch education is...   Each statement should be a short phrase expressing one idea only.  In the next step of the procedure, the participants were asked to  sort the statements into groups of similarity in meaning and label  them. Next to sorting, the participants rated on 1-to-5 scale the  statements on two values: importance (5 = very important; 1 = not  important at all) and feasibility (5 = very feasible; 1 = not feasible  at all). Sorting and rating were also facilitated through the online  environment.   2.3 Participants  31 participants took part in the idea generation phase. 63 were  invited to participate in the second phase of the study, which  required sorting and rating the statements. Of them, 39 completed  the sorting, 36 the rating on importance and 34 the rating on  feasibility.    3. RESULTS  3.1 Idea generation  31 participants of the Dutch LASI event generated 141 ideas.  After idea cleaning and pruning (splitting statements containing  more than one idea; removing identical and vague statements) the  number of statements were reduced to 108. The GCM  methodology suggests that the final list of statements for sorting  and rating should not exceed 125.    3.2 Analysis of Sorting Data  Figure 1. presents the first result from the Multidimensional  scaling (MDS) of the sorting data.                                                                      1 http://www.conceptsystemsglobal.com/learninganalytics/brainstorm     Figure 1: Point map   The two-dimensional graphical configuration represents the ideas  on the impact of LA on Dutch education (as points on the map)  and shows how they are related. The closer the points are to each  other, the closer in meaning they are. This is a result of more  people grouping them together during the sorting. The extent to  which this mathematical model represents the original judgment  of the participants can be determined by stress value (index), a  routine statistics produced by MDS. For GCM studies it should be  in the range between .05 and .35. The stress index of this study is  .24, which indicates that the map represents very well the original  sorting of the participants. In addition, MDS assigns each  statement a bridging value, which is between 0 and 1. A low  bridging value means that a statement has been grouped together  with statements around it. A higher bridging value means that the  statement has been grouped together with some statements further  apart from the either side.   Some groups of ideas about changes LA will bring to the Dutch  education system can already be detected by a simple visual  inspection, but to make the process more efficient, we applied  Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). To determine the number of  clusters that best reflects the data we checked different solutions  provided by the HCA, starting from 16-cluster solutions until we  arrive at 5-cluster solutions. This is inline with the GCM  methodology, as most GCM studies report between 5 and 16  cluster solutions [10].   We prepared further a checklist with the suggestions made by the  HCA for merging clusters to determine the best fitting solution.  At each step of the merging two researchers indicated whether  they agreed, undecided, or disagreed with the suggestion.  After completing the assignment, the analysis team looked at the  worksheets to determine where the agreed proposals moved to  disagreed ones and selected the 7-clusters solution as the best  fitting solution as shown in Figure 2.   159      Figure 2: Seven clusters solution  The next step in making sense of the data was to attach  meaningful labels to the clusters. There are three methods  available for entitling the clusters. The first method is to check  what labels the GCM system proposes. The second method is to  look at the bridging values of the statements included in the  cluster. The statements with lower bridging values better  represent a cluster. The third method is simply to read through all  the statements in a cluster and to apprehend its overall theme. To  define the cluster labels we combined all the three methods. The  following seven clusters were identified: 1. Student  Empowerment, 2. Personalization, 3. Research & Learning  Design, 4. Teacher Empowerment, 5. Feedback & Performance,  6. Risks, and 7. Management & Economics (see Figure 3).       Figure 3: Seven clusters solution with labels   Students Empowerment is about the benefits LA brings to students  in terms of better insights into their weak and strong  characteristics, self-regulated learning, tracking learning progress,  and increase their responsibility and employability. Some  representative statements in the cluster are: Can make students  aware of their strengths and weaknesses and where they can  improve, Can provide students with insights into effectiveness  of self-regulated learning - show the relation between predictions  of performance and actual learning outcomes and It empowers  learners to steer their own learning process.   Personalization is operationalized through key terms such as  differentiation of learning paths, individualization based on  capacity and level of knowledge, development of recommender  systems and just-in-time feedback. Some statements included in  this cluster are: Personalization of education by giving the  student insight into her/his learning capabilities, Content and   context will be better adapted to the needs and challenges of each  individual student, and More differentiation in learning paths /  individualization.    The statements in the cluster Research & Learning Design  emphasize the need for evidence-based solutions to learning  design and teaching. Representative statements in this cluster are:  New innovations will be more tested and evidence-based,  Indicate whether certain educational activities are effective for  the learning process of the students, and Improve educational  research by providing a method for investigating effects of  instructions on learning outcomes and transfer.   Teacher Empowerment highlights the positive effect of LA on  teaching. Some of the statements in this clusters are: Teachers  get more insight into the effectiveness of learning content and  assessments, Empowers teachers to get a dynamic view over  time of student activity and if needed adapt the educational design  accordingly and Empowers teachers to identify problem areas  within their course.    Feedback & Performance reflects the expectation of the  participants for improvements in providing feedback, assessment  and reflection. LA would shift the focus on passing the test to  mastering the content, performance and participation. Some  statements that compose this cluster are: More sophisticated  assessments, Improves learning outcomes by providing insight  into learners' misconceptions, and Measure effects of learning  by facilitating accurate and direct feedback.   The cluster Risks is about negative effects and drawbacks of LA  in terms of data ownership, privacy, dependency on IT systems,  and cheating. Statements representative for this cluster are: Will  impose data dictatorship, Possible wrong priorities caused by  misconceptions of data analyses (relationship is not cause) and  Privacy issues in education will come more to the fore.  Management & Economics is about monitoring and control  functions of LA. The effects of LA on the costs of education are  also discussed. Some representative statements are: Policy  makers will use LA to cut costs, School leaders will be more  transparent about their schools' performance to external  stakeholders and Competitiveness between higher education  organizations will increase because of learning analysis  benchmarking.   Very coherent clusters have a bridging value close to 0. This  indicating that the participants tend to agreed on the content of the  cluster. The most coherent cluster has been Students  Empowerment (average bridging value of 0.19), followed by  Personalization (0.29), Research & Learning Design (0.48),  Teacher Empowerment (0.40), Feedback & Performance (0.51),  Risks (0.61), and Management & Economics (0.65).  The distances on the GCM map indicates that the relationships  not only between individual statements but also between clusters.  The closer the clusters are to each other the stronger the  relationship between them is. The concept map in Figure 5  suggests two bigger areas of clusters. One (say east coast)  consists of five clusters (Students Empowerment, Personalization,  Research & Learning Design, Teacher Empowerment, Feedback  & Performance and another (west coast) includes two (Risks,  and Management & Economics). The clusters within each of these  larger areas are related in some way but there seems to be no  relationships between the clusters representing different areas  (e.g. Personalization and Risks). In addition, Personalization   160    apparently is more related to Students Empowerment rather than  to Teacher Empowerment and Research & Learning Design, the  last two have been seen more closely related to each other.  Feedback & Performance plays a bridging role between the two  pairs clusters in the east coast area. They are relevant for  Student and Teacher empowerment.    3.3 Analysis of Rating Data  High rating is represented within GCM through multiple layers  below a specific cluster. Figure 4. shows that the highest score (5  layers) goes to Teacher Empowerment, Personalization and  Feedback & Performance. One layer less get the clusters Students  Empowerment and Research & Learning Design. The clusters  Management & Economics and Risks, score low (one layer only).       Figure 4: Rating map on importance   The most valued clusters on feasibility are Teaching  Empowerment and Research & Learning Design, each with 5  layers. Four layers get the clusters Feedback & Performance and  Personalization. Students Empowerment gets 3 layers, Risks and  Management & Economics  1 (See Figure 5).       Figure 5: Rating map on feasibility     The ladder graph in Figure 6, called also a pattern match,  compares the clusters on their importance and feasibility ratings.  There is a very strong relationship between the two set of data  (r=0.94). Small differences can be detected in Personalization,  Feedback & Performance, and Students Empowerment, which  score relatively higher on importance than on feasibility, and  Research & Learning Design, which in contrast score higher on  feasibility.     Figure 6: Pattern match Importance vs. Feasibility   With respect to our expectations for possible differences between  novices experts we compared the novice group (n=20) with a  group of expert users (advanced users n=17 + expert n=2). We  tested both groups again on Importance (see Figure 7) and  Feasibility (see Figure 8) against each other. As the figures show  the novice participants highly agree with the experts on both the  importance and feasibility of ideas in different clusters. The  correlation between the two groups is very high for both values  (r=0.99).      Figure 7: Pattern Match Novice vs. Expert on Importance   4. Discussion and Conclusions  The GCM study at the LASI event Amsterdam showed some  interesting results for the impact of LA on the Dutch Education  system. The studys outcomes confirm our expectation about a  possible overlap between the issues identified in this study and  themes discussed in the dedicated literature on Learning Analytics    In contrast to what we expected, the GCM study demonstrated a  very high agreement between the novice and the expert  participants on how important and feasible are changes that LA  brings to the Dutch education. It seems to be an indication for an  already existing consensus between different stakeholders  involved in the LA community in the Netherlands. The  community highly agrees on required topics that are of  importance to influence the educational system with LA.   161      Figure 8: Pattern Match Novice vs. Experts on Feasibility   Furthermore, they also agree on the feasibility of specific LA  factors to impact Dutch education in a short timeframe. The  results of the study indicated that novices and experts see LA as  beneficial for empowering students and teachers. Both groups  believe that LA would improve feedback, assessment and  personalization for students and teachers. The study has identified  also some possible risks of LA but neither the novices nor the  experts see those as serious treats for the implementation of LA in  the Dutch education system.    Both groups value ideas related to students and teachers  empowerment, personalization, and research & learning design  more than management and economic aspects of LA.  Personalization and self-regulated learning are the most salient  benefits for students. Personalization has been identified as a  cluster that scored the highest on both importance and feasibility.  LA stimulates new forms of feedback and personalization, which  is essential for improving both teaching (clusters teachers  empowerment and research & learning design) and learning  (clusters students empowerment and personalization).    The study has some limitations with respect to the generalization  of the findings. First of all, the findings are valid only for the  Netherlands. It would be interesting to compare these results with  those of other countries. We therefore, already team-up with  partners in Australia that are interested to run a comparable GCM  study. A meta-study including different GCM studies would be a  unique research initiative that would provide a strong evidence for  the rollout of LA methods and technologies in different  educational systems.    Second, although the optimal number of participants for the  sorting have been reached, as indicated in a meta-analytical study  on GCM [15], we could have tried to involve more experts for the  rating phase.    5.

As the field matures and more research  emerges demonstrating the significant teaching and learning  benefits of the practice, a growing number of learning  organizations are considering adopting LA initiatives. Whether  these plans emerge from a research teams findings, a strategic  plan, or a mandate from leadership, one thing is certain: learning   analytics is not a fad likely to fade away. In fact, The New Media  Consortium has listed learning analytics in the past three Horizon  Reports suggesting that the potential for LA to significantly  impact education has reached the mainstream [1]. However,  assuming all institutions have the same probability of success in  carrying out an LA initiative is a costly mistake. Typically, LA  projects require significant investment, and, like any investment,  should not be undertaken without thoughtful and deliberate  consideration of factors that may contribute to success.     The literature offers would-be practitioners a solid base of theory,  process, and research. To be sure, these sources provide an  invaluable source of knowledge for those looking to make an  initial foray into the LA field. However, most literature to date  does not address the concept of institutional readiness in more  than a cursory fashion. Many landscape works exist [2, 3, 4], the  EDUCAUSE Center for Applied Research developed The  Analytics Maturity Index [5], and Drachsler and Greller have  examined stakeholder perceptions and expectations of LA [6], but  there has been little concerted effort focused on the fundamental  question of whether an institution is ready to undertake a learning  analytics initiative. The authors of the present study argue that  before embarking on a LA journey, institutions need to have a  realistic understanding of how ready they are so that they are  better positioned for success. The logistics of starting a LA  initiative can seem daunting in a diverse and still evolving space.     2. THE NEED FOR REFLECTION  As discussed earlier, it is imperative that institutions considering  learning analytics reflect upon their readiness to do so. This  exercise in institutional-reflection must be thorough so that a  comprehensive understanding from which decisions can be  informed can be created. To achieve an accurate understanding of  an institutions readiness, multiple perspectives much be taken  into account. Successful LA projects often have cross-disciplinary  teams on them, demonstrating that the expertise and skills  necessary to implement a project are diverse [4]. It only stands to  reason, then, that looking at a single perspective before deciding  to undertake an initiative could lead to a less than successful  endeavor. We posit that gathering readiness feedback from  administrators and faculty, various departments, and multiple  levels of an institution is imperative to minimize bias individual  lenses may inadvertently interject. Collecting feedback from  multiple levels of an institution also will provide a more realistic  understanding of skills and expertise that can be accessed in  support of an LA project, since simply having the resources  somewhere on a campus is not sufficient; a project must have  ready access to the requisite resources [7, 8].

THE LEARNING ANALYTICS  READINESS INSTRUMENT   The authors put forth the Learning Analytics Readiness  Instrument (LARI) for consideration. The LARI is a survey  instrument designed to be completed by multiple people within an  institution as they deliberate the merits of engaging with an LA  project. Conceptually, the LARI could be used in the formative  stages of planning to undertake a LA initiative. While still in an  iterative state, it will ultimately provide an institutional profile  with readiness indicators on several key elements necessary for  LA success. The LARI has been designed to serve the purpose of  a prescriptive diagnostic, meaning the instrument can be used to  help determine strengths as well as potential foci that may need  additional attention before a large-scale initiative is undertaken.    3.1 Framework for Creation   When creating the framework for the LARI, the authors wanted to  ensure it was fully situated in the existing learning analytics  space. While this space is not yet comprehensively defined, many  definitions have been proffered by scholars and institutions.       The Society of Learning Analytics Research defines learning  analytics as the measurement, collection, analysis and  reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for  purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the  environments in which it occurs [9].     The EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative posits that LA  evaluate[s] large data sets to provide decision makers with  information that can help determine the best course of action  for an organization, with a specific goal of improving  learning outcomes, which could be measured by grades,  retention, or completion; further, it specifically mention the  use of digital breadcrumbs and peer comparison [10].    van Barneveld, Arnold and Campbell argue that LA is the  use of analytic techniques to help target instructional,  curricular, and support resources to support the achievement  of specific learning goals [11].    Cooper states that analytics is the process of developing  actionable insights through problem definition and the  application of statistical models and analysis against existing  and/or simulated future data [12].    Krumm, Waddington, Lonn, and Teasley claim that learning  analytics uses data to inform decision-making; leverages data  to identify students in need of academic support; and allows  for direct user interaction with a tool to engage in some form  of sensemaking that supports a subsequent action [13].      While these are not the only definitions present in the literature,  the context of learning analytics can be broadly formed using  these five definitions. The LARI is framed using clearly  delineated assumptions rather than a precise definition. Drawing  from the definitions above, the following principles were  incorporated as a definition and broad consideration for the LARI:  Institutions should examine 1) rich, learning-related data sets, 2)  as they are exposed to various analytics techniques, 3) in an effort  to support teachers and/or learners, 4) as those populations move  toward intervention, action, and increased success. By adopting  this framework for practice, the LARI was created to firmly seat  LA at the intersection of big data and student success.     3.2 Readiness Components  As originally designed, the LARI consisted of five readiness  components: governance/infrastructure, ability, data, culture, and  process. The optimal environment for learning analytics success   would include sufficient readiness on each of the five  components. Composite institutional scores, created by combining  multiple individuals scores from a single institution, serve as a  catalyst for intense reflection on each component.   3.2.1 Governance and Infrastructure   The governance and infrastructure component exists to encourage  reflection of foundational aspects of learning analytics. Elements  included in this category include technical infrastructure,  institutional governance, policies and oversight.   3.2.2 Ability  To achieve success in any learning analytics initiative, proper  abilities must be accessible. A wide range of skills will be utilized  at different points during an implementation, ranging from  technical expertise and analytic proficiency to strategic leadership  and student support skills. The ability component encourages  exploration of all these requisite skills, along with realistic  expectations of unfettered access to said skills.   3.2.3 Data  Data is an essential component of success in learning analytics.  This component focuses on helping individuals and institutions  reflect on their readiness status by investigating what types of data  are present within the institution, how valid and reliable those  sources are, how the data is stored and accessed, and what data  ownership, distribution, and utilization paradigms exist.    3.2.4 Culture  The fourth component examined in the LARI is culture.  Institutional change requires cultural acceptance to reach its  greatest potential. The cultural domain, then, is vitally important  in helping an institution reflect on the level of readiness for LA.  This component examines the awareness and acceptance of data- driven decision making, the existence of stakeholder support, and  the presence of shared vision for support of student success.    3.2.5 Process  The process of implementing LA is the final component in the  LARI. This element includes the examination of stakeholders and  the extent to which theyre involved in the process. This element  also contains pragmatic concerns, such as sustainability and  project/process management needed to move an idea from goal to  reality.      4. METHODOLOGY  4.1 Procedure  Once developed and framed within the current LA literature, the  authors sought to pilot the instrument in an effort to gather  feedback regarding the LARI and perform item reduction through  the use of both the feedback and an exploratory factor analysis.   Because of the nature of the survey, the authors sought out those  associated with institutions and/or familiar with successful  implementations of LA who were largely associated with a  consortium of research institutions in the American Midwest.  Additionally, individuals associated with other institutions were  targeted based on their experience and knowledge. Participants  were emailed multiple times over the course of six weeks to  request them to complete the instrument, which was deployed via  an online survey tool. After a sufficient number of responses were  obtained, data were downloaded and analyses conducted.     4.2 Participants  A convenience sample of persons familiar with successful  implementations of LA completed the instrument. In all, thirty-  164    three respondents from nine different institutions participated in  the pilot survey; of the nine institutions, one was Canadian, while  the remaining were from the United States. All respondents were  faculty or staff at their respective institutions with roles that were  related to learning analytics, data analysis, and/or research related  to educational technologies. The nine institutions are all large  research universities with high undergraduate enrollments.      5. RESULTS  5.1 Factor Analysis  An exploratory factor analysis was conducted using the 139  quantitative measures from the pilot survey instrument in order to  A) intelligently reduce the length of the survey by eliminating  questions that did not fit logically with other items on the survey  and B) confirm and/or redefine the five readiness components  described in Section 3.2.  Five factors were extracted in an initial factor analysis using  varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization. Using the  conventional exclusion criteria of |.30| [14], as well as removing  items that did not load well on any factor or seemed incongruous  with the factor onto which they loaded, 42 survey items were  eliminated from the extracted factors. A second factor analysis,  also extracting five factors, eliminated an additional 7 survey  items. The final 90 survey items with factor loadings unique to  each of the five factors, explained 55.7% of the variation. The 90- item the LARI had a Chronbachs alpha of .946, indicating a high  level of internal consistency.   Since each factor includes survey items that have different ordinal  and interval scales, regression factor scores were used for  investigation of the extracted factors. In this case, a score of 0  indicates a respondents ratings are close to the average whereas a  negative or positive score indicates lower or higher ratings  compared to the average, respectively [15]. Descriptive statistics  are presented in Table 1. The skewness and kurtosis indicated that  all factors had a negatively skewed distribution. Also, the  Cronbach's alpha statistics indicated that all factors had a  relatively high internal consistency.     Table 1.

For example,  My  institution has professionals with mathematical / statistical  experience in deriving and validating statistically sound  algorithms (e.g., simulations, cross validation)  (5-point Likert  scale from Strongly Disagree  Strongly Agree).   5.1.2 Factor 2: Data  The second factor, Data (Eigenvalue = 9.57), measures  respondents' perceptions regarding the extent to which different  types of data are collected at the institution and the  person(s)/group(s) responsible for storing and maintaining that  data. For example,  The extent to which my institution currently  collects Admissions data (e.g., prospect demographics, interests,  application evaluation, DescriptorPlus)  (7-point Likert scale  from Does not currently collect  My institution collects all /  nearly all of this data).  5.1.3 Factor 3: Culture & Process  The third factor, Culture & Process (Eigenvalue = 9.23),  measures respondents' perceptions regarding institutional norms  concerning data use, sharing, security, and how data is utilized in  reports and decision making. For example,  My institution has a  culture that accepts the use of data to make decisions  (5-point  Likert scale from Strongly Disagree  Strongly Agree).    5.1.4 Factor 4: Governance & Infrastructure  The fourth factor, Governance & Infrastructure (Eigenvalue =  6.14), measures respondents' perceptions regarding the  institution's investment in learning analytics and professional staff  who possess skills and experience related to data management,  training, and documentation. For example,  My institution has  professionals with knowledge and expertise in manipulating data  from multiple sources and platforms to conform to institutional  specifications  (5-point Likert scale from Strongly Disagree   Strongly Agree).    5.1.5 Factor 5: Overall Readiness Perceptions  The fifth factor, Overall Readiness Perceptions (Eigenvalue =  4.87), measures respondents' perceptions regarding a variety of  areas including institutional resources, IRB, the faculty's  acceptance of learning analytics, and professional specializations.  For example,  My institutions faculty largely accept the use of  analytics for improving teaching and learning  (5-point Likert  scale from Strongly Disagree  Strongly Agree).      5.2 Institutional Differences  Mean factor scores were calculated for each institution with at  least two participants (see Table 2). There was a significant  difference between means for the Ability factor (F(6, 24) =  2.755, p = .035) and for the Overall Readiness Perceptions factor  (F(6, 24) = 3.574, p = .011). Most institutions rated the Ability  and Culture & Process factors lower than the calculated overall  average while the Data and Governance & Infrastructure factors  were typically rated higher than the calculated average. Results  for the Overall Readiness Perceptions factor were mixed,  reinforcing the fact that analytics readiness is highly variable  across institutions and that LA is not as widespread or as  competently applied as many may think. This also underscores the  need for institutional reflection, given how institutions can make  wildly different yet equally effective changes to their policies,  practices, and approaches to student success through analytics.    165    6. DISCUSSION  6.1 Unpacking the LARI Factors  The purpose of this study was twofold: create a practical, more  parsimonious version of the Learning Analytics Readiness  Instrument and ensure that the factors within the revised LARI  were internally consistent and contained mutually exclusive items.  As demonstrated in the previous section, these two ends were  achieved; over 40 items were removed from the original  instrument, and the current version has five factors with high  Chronbachs alpha scores and low collinearity with each another.  Most of the literature regarding learning analytics within  institutions has focused either on successful implementations or  the extent to which an institution has matured in its use of  analytics to positively affect student success; the current study  works to fill the void in the literature regarding how an institution  can proactively work to successfully implement learning analytics  by understanding its own strengths and weaknesses with regard to  the five aforementioned factors.    The LARI was reduced from 139 to 90 items while maintaining  high internal consistency for the overall measure and the five  subscales. The presence of marker variables within the factors  suggests a robust solution and clearly define the constituent  factors, despite there being a relatively small sample size [16, 17].  The factors resulting from the analysis were slightly different than  those originally conceived by the authors.  Where the authors  conceived culture and process as being distinct constructs, data  indicated that the items were very much intertwined; as such, one  factor was created in the revised LARI where two were  envisioned at the start. Additionally, the authors believed that the  concept of overall readiness for analytics would arise from simply  completing the survey, but upon analysis, it became apparent that  the overarching notion of readiness cleanly fit within the survey.   The Culture and Process factor is comprised of items that  formerly made up the original two factors of culture and process,  but also several from original categories of data and  governance/infrastructure. To us, this means that many of the  components related to data do not involve procuring or analyzing  the data as much as the rules, policies, paradigms, and practices  that surround the use of data on campus. Further, items in the new  factor relate also to the extent to which an institution has specific  goals or objectives spelled out, as well as internal processes that  will allow for analytics to be implemented.  As noted earlier, all respondents were affiliated with large,  research-intensive universities. As such, data procurement or  analysis did not seem to be areas of concern. Rather, these   respondents, both within an institution and across the broader data  set, noted that the concepts of ability and broad institutional  readiness were of greatest concern. The ability factor, while an  area of concern for the respondents, is not a surprising finding.  Bischel [4] noted that many institutions have concerns with being  able to direct existing resources to analytics, continuing that  many staff members are too busy  to think about analytics  and that future calls and actions for greater accountability could  further distance institutions from starting LA projects (p. 14).   Readiness as a factor in and of itself, rather than an outcome  measure of the LARI overall, is something that bears more  discussion here. Many institutions want to apply analytics because  it is something their peers are doing, or because theyve seen  strong, positive results emerge from other institutions  implementations. While emulating peers in a manner that results  in an institution bettering itself is admirable, the notion of being  ready to actually do that work is an important one. Norris and  Baer [2] indicate that institutions should start with a strategic  question and from there determine the best means of approaching  it. The items that comprise the overall readiness perceptions, to  some extent, revolve around knowledge of analytics on campus,  and, perhaps more importantly, the extent to which institutional  will exists to move LA projects forward.   Powell and MacNeil [18] have one of the few publications in the  analytics frame discussing readiness, and with it governance and  practice. However, while much of their writing is applicable in  any educational environment, feedback to the authors on the  LARI indicated distinct governance and infrastructure differences  among different countries systems of higher education. This  distinction is important, and one of the limitations discussed in the  next section.    6.2 The LARIs Utility for the Field  Broadly, the LARI is a tool that is an important contribution to the  field of learning analytics, particularly as it is applied to an  institution looking to positively affect student success. Where  little to no guidance currently exists for institutions to consult as  they begin to implement analytics, the LARI, when fully  completed, will bring not only an understanding of where an  institution currently excels, but also where it has deficiencies   and will provide specific actions an institution can take to help  mitigate or remediate those areas to ensure the broadest chances  of success for the project.    7. LIMITATIONS  The biggest limitation associated with this study is the small  sample size. Ideally, a much larger sample encompassing a  broader range of institutions would have been employed in this   Table 2.

Secondly, in  interacting with others based in non-American institutions, it  became apparent that while many of the challenges involved with  an analytics implementation are common across national  boundaries, those associated with governance, infrastructure, and  culture are not as ubiquitous. As such, further research will need  to be conducted to better understand how different systems of  higher education are governed, and how those practices affect the  application of data to improve student success.   8. NEXT STEPS  From here, additional research will be conducted using the more  parsimonious version of the LARI. Multiple institution types will  be sought out to ensure that the instrument holds its psychometric  properties  and potential usefulness  across institution types.  Additionally, work will be done to determine which persons at  which levels of an institution should be involved in completing  the LARI so that appropriate guidance may be given to those  wishing to employ this tool. Third, the tool will be built into an  automated website for delivery and feedback.   Finally, as referenced in the discussion section, this tool is not  meant to serve solely as a diagnostic. While simply knowing  where on a scale one lies is useful, the authors believe that  additional guidance is necessary so as to appreciate the meaning  behind a given score. For example, knowing that an institution has  a low score in ability is necessary, but nowhere near nuanced  enough to help remedy that institution remedy the problem. As  such, the researchers will work to develop automated yet specific,  actionable feedback that will indicate where energies may be  focused to increase the chance of a successful LA implementation,  as well as suggested steps, evidenced by their peer institutions to  take towards that end.     9.

INTRODUCTION Adult post-secondary students in America expect their ed-  ucational experiences to be relevant to their careers. In 2010, 75 percent of Americans reported a college education to be essential for success in todays society [7]. Unfortunately, these high expectations for education are not being met. A recent international study found that only about half of the students surveyed believed their studies had improved their employment opportunities [17]. These findings may not sur- prise faculty, many of whom have long known that students often have a difficult time articulating the value of college be- yond the credentials it produces [26], but have nevertheless  Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for per- sonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

However, faculty confidence in the outcomes of post-secondary education is challenged by survey data showing that most employers report insufficient preparation amongst new hires [17]. Moreover, the Organi- zation for Economic Cooperation and Developments inter- national study of adult basic skills has shown comparatively middling to low performance of American adults in basic mathematics, use of technology, and literacy [18]. Com- bined, these studies suggest that more needs to be done to help students connect their educational experiences to their personal and professional aspirations.  Direct assessment programming and supportive competency- based curriculum [8] presents an opportunity for administra- tors to examine and improve the relevance of their program- ming. Competencies are defined as the knowledge, skills, abilities, and professional attributes required to successfully perform a task in a given context [11] and signal a degree of career relevance not visible in traditional curricular models. Central to the operations of a competency-based curricu- lum is the quality and coordination of faculty assessment practices across a programs curriculum [22]. The state of the art in educational assessment systems emphasizes the importance of aligning assessment practices through mea- sures of student learning that can support both formative and summative purposes [19]. Direct assessment practices bridge these purposes by establishing measures of student learning that are embedded throughout a program and uti- lized with every student.  Student grades may seem sufficient as a measure of stu- dent learning for direct assessment programs, but several historical issues prevent institutions from relying on grades. Over the last decade, American regional accrediting agen- cies have consistently encouraged institutions to implement robust assessment systems to measure and promote student learning [20]. These efforts have had several positive effects, with many institutions now articulating intended learning outcomes, but these advances have occurred mostly at the institutional level and have largely not affected the grad- ing practices of faculty [12]. By policy and practice, fac- ulty members in American universities have long held sole responsibility for issuing student grades [1]. While this ap- proach to grading is entirely appropriate, it has also led to the development of diverse grading practices, confusion over the basis for student grades, and a gradual lowering of per- formance standards in American colleges and universities. Currently, A level grades are estimated to represent 43 per-  168    cent of all letter grades assigned by faculty; this represents an increase of 28 percent since 1960 [21]. This increase in very high grades cannot be accounted for by corresponding increases in studying behavior [5] or levels of demonstrated learning [4]. Historical reviews have reported little progress made within academic programs to measure even the most common learning outcomes of an undergraduate education [6]. This weak state of grading practices in higher education has undermined grades as a marker of individual distinction in the job market. Human resource managers view grades with ambivalence when evaluating applicants for positions [25] and major companies view GPA as essentially a silly number[16].  Our position is that the most direct way for institutions to help students appreciate their educational experience is to align faculty grading practices with specific competen- cies and to visualize student learning for multiple stakehold- ers. Prior research has provided encouraging results sug- gesting that students and faculty can utilize personalized dashboards to improve academic outcomes[2, 27]. This pa- per reports on a multi-year effort to measure and visualize student learning via a competency map by presenting pre- liminary evaluation results with MBA students.  2. INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT Capella University is a regionally accredited online insti-  tution whose mission is to extend access to adult students seeking to maximize their personal and professional poten- tial. Founded in 1993 as the Graduate School of America, the institution was renamed Capella University in 1999 and continues to serve primarily graduate students. The uni- versitys history of measuring and reporting on students demonstration of outcomes and competencies has been in- strumental to the development of the competency map (for more details, please see the National Institute for Learn- ing Outcome Assessments case study[9]). Conceptually, the university uses a fully-embedded assessment model (FEAM) to measure each students competency demonstration via the alignment of all graded course assignments and scoring guide criteria. Alignment is established through the inde- pendent judgments of subject matter experts and assessment specialists, with disagreements mediated in a reconciliation session with the faculty chair. All subject matter experts receive detailed training1 and are required to successfully complete a brief qualifying assessment.  The competency map utilizes these documented align- ments to measure and report on students competency demon- stration based on facultys grading practices. Faculty grade assignments using an electronic scoring guide that both com- municates faculty feedback to students and records criterion- specific judgments as data concerning a students demon- stration of a specific competency. This course development approach has matured so that all academic offerings are cre- ated by a team of subject matter experts and faculty working with curriculum specialists, instructional designers, and as- sessment specialists (for an overview, see Creating Capella Universitys Academic Offerings2).  3. COMPETENCY MAP 1http://tinyurl.com/FEAMTraining 2http://tinyurl.com/AcademicOfferings  Capellas competency map is intended to inform students of their status and progress toward demonstrating specific competencies. Students can use their competency map to conceptualize their academic experience, communicate ac- complishments, and focus their future studying. The com- petency map is also designed to help faculty and advisors engage students more deeply in their academic program.  3.1 Student-Centered Design The competency map went through multiple design iter-  ations, both in its visualization and in the grain of data being displayed to the student. We believed students would be most interested in their performance relative to their cur- rent course and decided early on to frame the competency map relative to a specific course. As Figure 1 illustrates, the initial intention was to simultaneously display student sta- tus on unit assignments, course competencies, and program outcomes. In 2012, a student focus group appreciated this information, but many students were overwhelmed by the amount of information provided.  Figure 1: Initial competency map prototype display- ing unit-, course-, and program-level information  Based on this feedback, the team simplified the display using small multiples [28] to indicate a students status on each competency. Initially, the team used a colored sliding bar with the amount of coloring indicating the percentage of criteria assessed for a competency and the color of the bar indicating the overall demonstrated performance level (for an example, see Figure 2). However, subsequent testing revealed that students would inappropriately combine the two different metrics being represented by the slider bars; believing that the bars indicated the amount of progress made relative to the amount of progress expected. We also learned that students did not often know the competencies by number and needed to refer to the course syllabus in order to interpret the competency map.  The team reworked the sliding bars into colored circles to help differentiate the concepts of completion and demon- stration. The amount of shading indicates the percentage of criteria that have been assessed relative to the total number of criteria in the course aligned to the particular compe- tency. The color of the circle represents the overall level of performance demonstrated for the particular competency. The circles color is based on the students historical per- formance on all aligned scoring guide criteria. Capella Uni- versitys grading policy recognizes the following four perfor-  169    Figure 2: Early competency map prototype focusing exclusively on competency demonstration  mance levels, which were mapped to the indicated colors, red = non-performance, yellow = basic, light green = pro- ficient, and green = distinguished. In Figure 3, the student has demonstrated the first competency at a distinguished level of performance across the two criteria that have been assessed so far. All visual information is also presented nu- merically or textually to support visually impaired students.  3.2 Student Pilot During the first and second academic quarters of 2013,  School of Business students participating in a self-paced course pilot were provided with an email version of the competency map. These students were required to demonstrate each competency in the course by completing a series of assess- ments. The courses were referred to as self-paced because students were not required to advance on a weekly schedule or participate in weekly discussions with other students. The email version of the competency map contained a textual ta- ble that summarized the students performance relative to each course competency. It was sent to students soon after their assessment was marked by faculty.  This pilot involved sixteen different courses and more than two hundred students, which provided an opportunity for the team to test the performance of the data systems in- volved in producing the competency map. In this regard, the pilot successfully validated key pieces of the technical architecture and produced accurate competency map emails as expected. The student pilot was not part of the formal evaluation of the competency map, but supportive data were collected from students. More than 80 percent of students reported that the emailed competency maps were helpful or very helpful for understanding their competency perfor- mance. Furthermore, email tracking reports showed that every competency map email sent was opened, suggesting that the information was relevant to students.  3.3 MBA Rollout Based on these successful pilots, the competency map was  deployed in the July 2013 academic term for MBA graduate students. Several change management techniques were used to support the rollout of the competency map. A brief tuto- rial was developed to describe the unique design of the com- petency map to students.3 Faculty were engaged in a variety of ways using produced materials, meetings with leadership, listening sessions, and an interactive media piece that sim- ulated multiple use case scenarios.4 All student-facing staff  3http://tinyurl.com/competencymap 4http://tinyurl.com/FacultyScenarios  groups were similarly engaged in competency map training sessions, including student advising, career center, faculty support, IT support, customer care, and enrollment services.  3.3.1 Utilization Students use of the competency map was optional and  therefore it was important to track utilization to analyze outcome measures. To track utilization we implemented a custom link solution that logged the students ID number every time a student accessed the competency map. Using this technique, we could discern that 31 percent of the MBA students viewed the competency map during the July term. Of these students, more than half viewed the competency map repeatedly and a small handful viewed it more than ten times throughout the term. All subsequent analysis re- lies on these utilzation data to segment students based on competency map usage.  3.3.2 Academic Performance The competency map provides detailed information about  facultys performance expectations for each courses assign- ment and this information is intended to help focus students studies and improve their academic performance. We mea- sured academic performance by examining the distribution of demonstrated competency proficiency levels. As shown in Table 1, students who viewed the competency map demon- strated competencies at slightly higher levels of performance than students who did not, although this effect was not sta- tistically significant.  3.3.3 Persistence Based on prior studies that have found personalized stu-  dent dashboards to increase persistence across academic pro- grams[3], we expected competency map to increase next term registration rates. As expected, students who utilized the competency map registered for a course the following academic term at a significantly higher rate than those stu- dents who never viewed the competency map. This effect is consistent with our belief that adult students value know- ing how their educational experience relates to their career success.  Given our relatively weak research design, this higher rereg- istration rate could be accounted for by multiple other ex- planations. One possibility is that a general engagement effect accounts for these results  students who are likely to persist in their program are generally more active and in- volved in their courses. This effect is likely to be significant given prior research that has found courseroom activity, such as frequency of logging into the course, posting in discussion threads, and dwell time to be good predictors of learner suc- cess[14]. We attempted to statistically account for these ef- fects using a logistic regression model (1) that included a generalized predictive model index (PMI) consistenting of multiple measures of student engagement. By including the PMI in our regression model, we are able to test for the unique variance accounted for by utilization of the compe- tency map on reregistration behavior. We found that com- petency map utilization significantly predicted reregistration behavior the following term, even when the regression model includes PMI. Specifically, competency map utilization ac- counted for an additional 7 percent of the variance in reregis- tration behavior beyond the PMI metric alone. We interpret these results as strong evidence supporting the value stu-  170    Figure 3: Final competency map design  dents place on understanding and monitoring their progress in demonstrating competencies.  ReRegistration = + 1PMI + 2Usage+ i (1)  4. CONCLUSION We have shown that course-level assessment practices can  be aligned with a programs curriculum and successfully vi- sualized for students in a manner that promotes reregistra-  tion behavior. Our approach was to develop an outcomes- based curricular structure with supporting competency as- sessments and criterion-referenced scoring guides. We be- lieve this approach is unique in higher education in its en- gagement and reliance on faculty to measure students com- petency demonstration. Moreover, our positive results are important because, although American post-secondary en- rollments have risen to historic levels[23], graduation rates have not significantly increased [15].  In many ways, the challenge of measuring and reporting  Table 1: Competency demonstration performance levels by competency map utilization Usage Non-performance Basic Proficient Distinguished No Utilization 6% 8% 21% 65% Utilization 3% 6% 17% 75%  171    competency demonstration is larger than any particular in- stitution and needs to be contextualized within a histori- cal context to envision the adjacent possible[10]. Various thought leaders, employers, professional associations, pol- icy makers, and accreditation officials are actively working in this area, especially in relation to critiquing the credit hour as a measure of student learning [13], and envision- ing a future competency platform [24]. As more institu- tions measure learning outcomes, cross-institutional collab- orations amongst faculty can help clarify performance expec- tations for degree programs and thereby support a focus on competency demonstration, such as via the Lumina Founda- tions Tuning USA5, the Association of American Colleges and Universities Valid Assessment of Learning in Under- graduate Education rubrics6, and the Lumina Foundations Degree Qualifications Profile7. Such cross-institutional col- laborations build trust and deepen a programs commitment to student success.  5. REFERENCES [1] American Association of University Professors.

INTRODUCTION  In this study we investigate the student-resource interactions in a   course that was recently conducted using Moodle as a learning   management system (LMS). Whereas in previous instances of the   same lecture the LMS was only used to distribute lecture slides   and exercise assignments, this course followed a new teaching   approach inspired by the concept of massive open online courses   (MOOCs). It takes up elements of both xMOOCs and cMOOCs   [5]the supply of lecture videos, reading materials, weekly online   exercises and discussion forums as well as collaborative activities   such as the production of a glossary in Wiki format with group   writing and peer reviewing activities. These collaborative online   activities completely replaced the previous presence-based and   quite teacher-centric exercise. The course was not opened to the   outside, thus there was no massification beyond the expected   audience of about 40 students  from three M.Sc. programs, all   related to computer science and interactive media. Since it was   our first experience with a course declared as a lecture (and not,   e.g., a project)  having such a strong emphasis on collaborative   online activities and electronic material, we were particularly   interested in analyzing how the participants made use of the   additional learning resources and how this influenced   collaboration and participation in the course. Therefore network   analysis methods were used to investigate the dynamics of   relations between students and resources and to identify   characteristic patterns of the course. The main research questions   are:     Do students use content produced by others   Which resources are important for which students   How do the relations between students and learning   resources evolve over time    Are there differences between students of different  study programmes who attended the lecture   According to the theme of the LAK14 conference, Intersection   of learning analytics research, theory and practice, the   contributions of this paper are twofold: First, a new method is   introduced to the field of learning analytics that can be applied to   identify and trace clusters of students and resources over time.   Second, we use analytic methods to generate insights into the   resource usage in lectures enriched with additional learning   elements inspired by MOOCs.    The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the   theoretical background concerning the role of learning resources   and activities in general and more specific in the context of online   learning. Section 3 describes the design of the analysed university   course. In section 4 we introduce our analysis methods, before we   explain the analysis of the mentioned learning course. Section 6   concludes the main results and gives an outline of possible future   research directions.      2. BACKGROUND  Online learning environments and their ability to facilitate   distributed learning activities enable a wide variety of course   designs especially in academic education. Massive Open Online   Courses (MOOCs) constitute a current trend in practical   applications of technology-enhanced learning. Because of the   large number of participants in such online courses the personal   supervision of learners by teachers is not possible.

While in xMOOCs students   mainly act as consumers of predefined learning contents,   connectivist MOOCs (cMOOCs) as introduced by G. Siemens and   S. Downs (c.f. [5]) focus on the production and sharing of   knowledge artefacts like blog or wiki articles by and between   learners [20]. Apart from targeting a broad audience, the shift of   learning activities into online environments can be of advantage   even in smaller scale [4, 22]. Hence, in the overlap of pure online   learning activities and presence lectures, hybrid approaches that   are also called blended learning courses. These courses aim to   combine the benefits of online learning and face-to-face sessions.   Such course designs enable learners to consume learning   resources, share and discuss results asynchronously and thus   independently of time and any place, while still having presence   events for community building and supervision [7]. Generally,   resources of various types play an important role in course design   regarding the support of autonomous learning.It has also been   argued that due to the variety of media or delivery channels such   courses are particularly suited to address the needs of different   learner types [9].    By investigating the relations between learners and learning   resources, we expect to gain deeper insights into the function of   the learning community. Hoppe et. al [13] introduced the concept   of social-thematic navigation through the sharing of learner-  created emerging learning objects. In this view, relations   between groups of learners induced by thematically related   learning objects indicate learners with a common interest. The   learners could interact indirectly mediated by those objects   without necessarily having a person-to-person communication.   Social network analysis methods have also been applied to   networks of people and artefacts to support the evolution of a   knowledge creating community in terms of identification of   people with common interests as well as trend analysis [12]. The   work presented in [21] evaluates data mining methods for   resource usage of students in LMS including statistics, clustering   and classification. However, most methods rely on static   snapshots of the state of a learning course and are not able to   capture the dynamic evolution over time. More recently, Kizilcec,   Piech, and Schneider [14] discovered engagement patterns of   learners in MOOCs based on their access to video lectures and   assessments in order to classify the users into subpopulations.       3. DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE  GILLS (Gestaltung interaktiver Lehr- / Lernsysteme, eng.   Design of interactive teaching and learning systems) is a master   level course at the Department of Computer Science and Applied   Cognitive Science at the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany)   that focusses on user/task modelling and models of interactive and   collaborative learning environments. It targets students from three   Master programmes Applied Computer Science, Interactive   Media and Cognition, Computer Engineering and can also be   attended by higher education teacher students of computer   science. The course is taught once per year with about forty   participants. It consists of a weekly three hour lecture   accompanied by a one hour exercises with weekly assignments.   Probably due to the given schedule of the course, attendance in   the exercise was typically lower than in the lecture and the   willingness for active participation (i.e. presentation of results on   the part of the students) was also low. Thus, in summer semester   2013 the exercise was virtualized, i.e. the presence based   activity was replaced by a combination of individual and group   assignments with reporting back into the used Moodle1 platform.   The plenary face-to-face setting of the lecture was used as a forum   to take up and discuss results from the virtual exercise activities.   The role of the lecture was redefined in the sense of providing   orientation knowledge (advance organizer) and core definitions   with a limited number of characteristic examples, leaving specific   extensions to the virtual exercise activities. These lecture elements   were provided as smaller thematic video clips, available on the   platform. Evidently, this new approach was inspired by the   concept of MOOCs and takes up elements of both xMOOCs and   cMOOCs, however being neither massive nor open.   The Moodle course contained one forum for announcements and   one for questions and discussions of the participants. The students   were asked to post questions relevant to the whole course in the   forum rather than to write emails to the supervisors. Additionally,   the forum was used to support group exercises. Furthermore, a   wiki was introduced to build a glossary for repetition and exam   preparation. A typical exercise regarding a wiki article consisted   of one week of creating the initial version in a small group, one   week of individually reading the articles of other groups as well as   writing peer feedback and one week of revising the article in the   original small group. Each group handled another topic enabling   students to specialize regarding their interests. Thus, groups were   formed by topic using Moodles choice activity, which was set up   to ensure groups of similar size. Furthermore, students could see   the choices of their peers to enable group formation and   communication.    Overall, the online exercises contained (per student):    Creating and revising four wiki articles in small groups    Two tasks regarding constructive problem solving and  modelling (partially using external tools) in small   groups    Writing peer reviews (as wiki comments) regarding the  group results above (individual task)    Creating and extending a concept map regarding the  topics of the first chapter using external tools (group   task)    Three quizzes regarding the three main topics for self- testing, which could be completed several times   (individual task)    Creating own questions and sample solutions in a wiki  with regard to the lecture topics (individual task)    Playing the serious game Matchballs [25] for training  relations between important concepts of the lecture   (individual task)   To motivate students for participating in the online exercises,   bonus points were introduced.   The Moodle course contained the following types of resources:    Lecture videos    Lecture slides    Additional reading material like scientific papers    Assignments including self-test quizzes    Wiki articles    Forum discussions                                                                     1 https://moodle.org/   174       4. ANALYSIS METHODS     4.1 Building student  resource networks  from students action logs  Actor-resource networks are bipartite networks. In bipartite   networks [23], also called two-mode networks, there exist two   sets of vertices. Edges only occur between vertices of different   sets.   In the case of bipartite actor-resource networks one set of vertices   represents actors who have connections to a second set of vertices   which represent resources. In our study we investigate bipartite   networks of students and learning resources over time. The   networks are based on the students activities within the learning   management system Moodle. The relations of students and   resources can be observed by event logs of resource access.   Whenever a student accesses a resource, e.g. opens a lecture   video, an event is generated and stored in the Moodle database.   These event logs contain the id of the student, the name, and id of   the resource as well as the timestamp of the event.    Based on these log files a time series of bipartite student-resource   networks can be extracted by sliding a specified time window   over the stream of resource access events. Each network of the   series (time slice) contains all relations between students and   resources that occurred within the corresponding time window.      4.2 Clustering of student - resource networks   Actors in evolving social networks usually develop a community   structure. This means that certain subsets of actors tend to be more   densely connected to each other than to outsiders [2, 24].   The detection of such cohesive subgroups or subcommunities of   actors in a social network is a common task in social network   analysis [6]. Subcommunity detection methods can partition a   graph into disjoint sets of nodes while maximizing the modularity   between clusters [8]. Other methods do not cluster all nodes   exhaustively and allow overlaps between clusters where nodes   cannot be assigned to a subgroup uniquely. A prominent example   for methods that detect overlapping subgroups is the Clique   Percolation Method (CPM) [18]   In this study, however, we investigate bipartite graphs where   people are connected to resources they accessed during a certain   period of time. In such actor - resource networks it is also possible   to identify densely connected substructures. Thus, a bipartite   subgroup, also called bipartite cluster, is a bipartite subgraph   where a set of actors is more densely connected to a set of   resources than to resources outside the cluster. Since the bulk of   learning resources provided to the students (see section 3), we   expect to find those clusters of students and learning resources   also in the time slices of the evolving student  resource network.   This can help to understand which students are interested in which   resources, and how such affiliations change over time.   In comparison to clusters in one-mode networks a bipartite cluster            consists of two parts, namely a set of actors                 and a set of resources               . Figure 1  shows the difference between clusters in one-mode and two-mode   networks. For example the orange bipartite cluster in the bottom   part of the figure contains the actor group                                         and the  resource group                    . In contrast to   subgroup detection in one-mode social networks, where social ties   between actors are directly observable, the actors within a   bipartite actor - resource cluster are not necessarily connected by   social relations. Moreover the actors share a common interest in   or awareness of the events of the bipartite cluster. In the following   the set of actors in a bipartite cluster is called actor group of the   cluster and the set of resources resource group of the cluster.    Figure 1: Comparison of traditional clustering of a one-mode   social network and a bipartite clustering of an actor    resource network. The node shapes indicate different node   types.                           The methods for subgroup detection in one-mode networks   mentioned above cannot be applied to identify bipartite subgroups   without modification.    The Biclique Communities method [15] is an adaption of the   Clique Percolation method [18] for bipartite networks. The   method relies on the definition of a      biclique. This is a  maximal connected bipartite subgraph with   nodes of the first  mode and   nodes of the second mode. Thus, if a set of   actors  all are connected to each of   resources, they form a      biclique.  A bipartite subgroup also called biclique community in [15] is   defined as the union of a series of adjacent      bicliques.          Figure 2: Example of two adjacent      bicliques. First clique:   {A, B, 1, 2}, second clique: {B, C, 2, 3}.   175    Two      bicliques are adjacent, if they share at least     nodes  of the first mode and     nodes of the second mode. Figure 2  depicts an example of two adjacent      bicliques.   4.3 Detection of evolution patterns in student   resource networks  The analysis of a static snapshots of a social networks or actor     resource networks can give various insights into their structure   [23]. However, since the most networks evolve over time, the   community structure also changes. In section 4.1 the   transformation of event logs of resource accesses into subsequent   snapshots (time slices) of an evolving bipartite network has been   described. It is likely that a subgroup detection method will   uncover different subgroups in each of the time slices. Since   subgroups do not appear and disappear at random, there can be   similar subgroups in consecutive time slices. This phenomenon   has recently been studied in social network analysis [16, 17]. In   social networks a group of people may stay in contact for a certain   period of time. There can be new members joining the group or   other members can leave the group at certain points in time but   there is a stable majority that is considered as the same subgroup   over several points in time. In such situations one can speak of the   same subcommunity with different instances in different time   slices or snapshots of a dynamic network.    Palla, Barabasi and Vicsek define six basic life cycle events for   subcommunities in one-mode social networks [17]. These events   are:     Birth: A subcommunity is identified the first time.    Growth:  A subcommunity acquires new members but is  core stays the same.    Contraction: A subcommunity loses members over time.    Merge: The members of distinct subgroups merge to  one subgroup at later point in time.    Split: One subcommunity splits into two new born sub- communities.    Death: A subcommunity disappears over time.  In bipartite networks of students and learning resources one may   also find patterns of the evolution of student  resource clusters.   The difference to one-mode networks is that in bipartite networks   the previously described events can happen to the actor and   resource groups of the bipartite clusters separately. By applying a   bipartite subgroup detection method to different slices of an   evolving student  resource network, one can identify traces of   dynamically evolving actor groups and resource groups. Figure 3   depicts an example of such traces. Each group of actors, in our   case students, forms a bipartite cluster with a group of resources at   a point in time. According to the change of affiliations of students   to resources the detected bipartite clusters can change over time.   However, similar actor groups or student groups can be detected   over time as part of different bipartite clusters. Thus one can   identify relations between similar actor or resource groups of   subsequent time slices. Table 1 shows those relations which allow   the tracing of actor and resource groups over time which results in   a timeline as in Figure 3.      Tracing the evolution of dynamic actor and resource groups   Given a list of subsequent time slices of k evolving actor-resource   networks              the first step is to apply the Biclique  Communities method described in section 4.2 to each of these   graphs. The result is an ordered list of   sets of bipartite clusters  (biclique communities) for the   time slices       {             }    {             }        {             } . As explained in section 4.2 each of the   bipartite clusters                   contains an actor group and a   resource group. In the context of the tracing algorithm the actor   groups and resource groups of particular time slices are called   step actor groups and step resource groups respectively.   Similar step actor / resource groups occurring in subsequent time   slices are assumed to be instances of the same dynamic group.   Thus, a dynamic actor group is a timeline of similar actor   groups and a dynamic resource group is a timeline of similar   resource groups. Figure 3 depicts the traces of a dynamic actor   and a resource group with step groups as particular instances. By   tracing step groups of actors and resources over several time slices   different life cycle events, or evolution patterns, of bipartite   clusters can be identified (cf. Table 1).    To identify the described events a method is needed that matches   the step groups of the time slices with step groups of previous   time slices. Although there are methods for tracing the evolution   of dynamic subcommunities in one-mode social networks [1, 10,   17], to our knowledge there are no such methods for bipartite   networks that allow the identification of the evolutionary events in   table 1. In the following, an adaption of the method of Green et. al   [10] is introduced, which was originally designed for one-mode   networks, to trace the subgroup structure in bipartite networks like   learner resource networks:   Initialization:   The method maintains two sets of not matched groups, one for   step actor groups (   ) and one for step resource groups (   ).  At the beginning of the process, the set     is the set of step  actor groups of the first time slice   (                   and       contains all step resource groups      {           } .   Matching phase:   After the initialization the algorithm precedes with the step groups   of the next time slice   .    The next step is to compute the similarity of the step actor groups   of    with all step actor groups in     and the similarity of the  step resource groups in    with the step resource groups in    .  As in [10] and [17] the Jaccard coefficient is used as measure of   similarity between two groups:             |     |  |    |          Here,   and   are either two step actor groups or two step  resource groups. If          exceeds a certain threshold, the  groups will be matched.    There are four different situations that can occur when matching   the current step groups in    to the not matched step groups in      and     in     .    1. One-to-one match between a step group of the current time  slice and a previously not matched group in     or    :   In this case the two groups belong to the same timeline of a   dynamic group. In Figure 3 this is the case for the dynamic   resource group   , which occurs in    and    .   2. One-to-many match: One not previously matched group in       matches to more than one group of the current time slice     . This indicates that the not previously matched group   176    splits up into the matched step groups of   . The matched   step groups of    are than considered as the first occurrences   of a new born dynamic group. In Figure 3the actor group        in timelice 1 matches with the two actor groups      and        which will then considered to be instances of new   dynamic actor groups    and   .   3. Many-to-one match: More than one not previously matched  groups in     or     match to the same step group of   .   This means that these groups merge to the matching group of     . The 4 th column of Table 1 is an example of such a   situation.   4. A step actor or step resource group of    cannot be matched  to any of the groups in     or    . In this case such a   group will be the first instance of a new born dynamic group.   An example for this is the resource group      in Figure 3.   After all step groups of the currently investigated time slice     were checked, all groups from     and     which could be  matched with one or more step groups of the currently   investigated time slice    will be removed from these sets.    All step groups of the current time slice    are then added to      and     respectively.   Then the algorithms moves on to the set of groups in the next time   slice. The algorithm stops when the last time slice was processed.   The result can then be visualized as a graph like in Figure 3.           Figure 3: Traces of dynamic actor (green circles) and resource   groups (orange squares) of bipartite clusters over time.      Table 1: Possible events in bipartite cluster evolution over   time. The nodes represent actor and resource groups   respectively. The arrows points from an event or actor group   to matching groups at a later point in time. Dotted lines   between two groups indicate the same bipartite cluster.      A group of actors and their   affiliations to resources stays   stable over subsequent steps in   time.      A group of actors shift their   interest to new resources.      A new group of actors A2   forms around an existing set of   resources.      Groups A1 and A2 merge   together and share their   affiliations to resources.      A group of actors A1 splits   into two new groups and do   not longer share their   affiliations to resources.         177    5. ANALYSIS OF THE BLENDED  LEARNING COURSE      5.1 General Analysis  The first lecture of the GILLS course was visited by 48 students,   of the 44 students doing the first exercise 40 regularly did their   exercises till the end of the course and 36 did the oral exam. The   Moodle course was frequently visited: There were 24 distinct   students per day and 45 per week on average (see also Figure 4).   The highest amount of distinct users per day was on lecture days   and the lowest on weekends. The deadline for and assignment of   new exercises was typically on lecture days, which may explain   the high number of accesses on these days.          Figure 4: Moodle usage over time      Figure 5 shows the relations of students in the course based on   group choices. The edge width indicates how often students were   in the same group; the darker the edge, the stronger the relation.   The node size represents the centrality of the students; the bigger   a node, the more relations to other students. On the one hand, the   network shows some groups of students often working together in   the same constellation (in the periphery of the graph). These   groups often consist of students of the same study programme. On   the other hand, there are students without a stable affiliation who   work with a high number of different students (in the center of the   graph). These might be the ones choosing an exercise/group by   topic rather than by social reasons.      Figure 5: Student relations based on group choices   5.2 Overlapping clusters of student and  learning resources  By applying the Biclique Community method (see section 4.2) to   the student resource networks we generated from the resource   access logs of the students, overlapping bipartite student    resource clusters were retrieved. Learning resources that   frequently appear in overlaps between bipartite clusters may be of   particular importance because students of different groups have   relations to them. Students who cannot be assigned to bipartite   clusters uniquely have a broader interest in learning resources   than other students   As a prototypical example for the bipartite clustering of students   and resources, Figure 6 depicts the subgroup structure of the   student resource network in the 10th week of the lecture period,   where the topic was Intelligent Tutoring Systems and   Cognitive User Modeling. The exercise assignment for this   week was to create wiki articles on the topic. It is worth to   mention that the applied Biclique Communites method for the   clustering does not cluster the nodes in a network exhaustively.   Nodes that do not belong to a      clique (see section 4.2) cannot  belong to a cluster. Hence Figure 6 only shows those students and   their relations to resources which are part of detected bipartite   clusters.      Figure 6: Overlapping bipartite subgroups in the 10th week of   the lecture period. Black nodes are in multiple subgroups.      The red cluster contains the wiki articles created in the previous   week, thus the included students can be considered to have   accessed them for creating peer reviews. This cluster overlaps   highly with other clusters, since writing peer reviews was only   part of the exercise.   The second part was writing wiki articles on ITS (two week task).   There were two articles on Constrained Based Tutoring (CBT)   and two on Model Tracing Tutors (one on Cognitive Tutors   and one on Pseudo Tutors). The green cluster focusses on   resources (papers, slides and videos) regarding CBT. The blue   cluster on the one hand contains resources regarding Model   Tracing Tutors (papers, slides, videos) as well as some of the wiki   articles which should be created (Cognitive Authoring Tool,   Pseudo Tutor). On the other hand it contains some of the wiki   articles (CTT, Heuristic Evaluation, Task Action Grammar) that   had to be corrected in the previous week. Since the deadline of the   old exercises and the assignment of new ones are on the same day,   these old assignments are also considered in the data.   The only resources in the orange cluster are videos of the first   weeks of the lecture that are not directly connected to the topics of   the considered time interval (week 10). Thus this cluster cannot be   easily explained. One interpretation might be that the students   178    already started with the repetition of the course. As can be seen in   Figure 4 video resources play an important role for exam   preparation.      5.3 Resource access during the lecture period  The resource access of the students is modelled as subsequent   time slices of an evolving bipartite network. The size of the time   slices is one week because so the resource access of the students   during one lecture week is aggregated in one time slice. The first   four weeks of the lecture period were skipped, because at this time   there are not many resources accessible in the course. To identify   bipartite subgroups in the time slices the Biclique Communities   method described in section 4.2 was applied with the parameters       and    . This means that an uncovered subgroup  contains at least   students and   resources. This choice is  reasonable, since the most students share some common resources   (e.g. lecture slides) and consequently smaller values lead to one   big cluster in the most of the time slices. Larger values for   and    have the effect that the most nodes cannot be clustered because   they do not belong to a corresponding      biclique.     The tracing algorithm described in section 4.3 requires a similarity   threshold for the matching of subsequent step groups. This   threshold was set to 0.3. This threshold is recommended in [10]   for the tracing of one-mode clusters, but is also suitable for our   method because it allows the detection of merges and splits of   dynamic groups but is not too low so that matching between step   groups occur at random.   The results for the tracing of the bipartite clusters during the   lecture period are depicted in Figure 7. For the visualization of the   subgroup traces the swim lane visualization introduced in [11]   was applied. The vertical lines connect step actor and step   resource groups that match between two time steps respectively.   The horizontal lines connect a step actor group (circle) with a step   resource group (square), if they belong to the same bipartite   cluster in the corresponding week. The node sizes correspond to   the contained number of resources or students respectively.    During the lecture period there is one big stable actor group (stud.   group 1). This actor group forms different bipartite clusters every   week with resource groups containing the core lecture material for   the particular week as well as the wiki pages created by the   exercise groups. This indicates that the students of this group are   not only affiliated to the core material and the wiki content   created by themselves, but also access the content created by the   others. This can e.g. be seen in Figure 6, where the big blue   bipartite cluster depicts the student group 1 in week 10 and their   affiliations to course resources. Many students of the major   student group 1 are also members of smaller actor groups at the   same time. Not all of the smaller student groups correspond to the   exercise groups that collaboratively edit wiki pages. Moreover the   wiki pages are used by the majority of students across exercise   groups. This can be an effect of the peer review exercises. The   smaller groups mostly contain students with close relations to the   additional learning material as well as lecture videos. Regarding   the patterns described in table 1, this corresponds to the stable   group pattern, described in the first row of table 1. Student group   1 accesses similar sets of resources in week 6 and 7 and also in   week 8 and 9. In these cases learning resources of the previous   week are still of importance. This shows that the peer reviewing   and wiki article revising exercises indeed encourage many of the   students to occupy themselves with the course material of   previous weeks.  However, the patterns of simultaneous merging   or splitting of the actor groups and resource groups of bipartite   clusters, described in row 4 and 5 of table 1, could not be found.       Figure 7: Visualization of the subgroup evolution of the last 9   weeks of the lecture period with interesting traces highlighted.         5.4 Resource access during the exam  preparation phase  In contrast to the lecture period, the exam preparation is self-  organized. Thus, in this period the students choose the resources   they need for their exam preparations based on their own schedule   and assessment.    Relevant questions regarding the exam preparation are:     Which resources are often used by certain groups of  students during preparations     What are typical traces of actor groups and resource  groups in such informal settings   Our method can help to answer these questions in order to provide   students with additional resources before the exam and to identify   those combinations of resources that are considered as relevant by   the students.    Figure 9 depicts the traces of bipartite student resource clusters   during the exam phase. The parameter settings for the subgroup   detection and the tracing algorithm are the same as in section 5.3.   However the size of the time slices is only four days instead of   179    one week as in 5.3. This is due to the more dynamic resource   access during the exam preparation phase.    There is one big cluster of learning resources, namely resource   group 1. This dynamic resource group is relatively stable. That   means there is a set of learning resources which is of particular   importance to the students for exam preparations. The different   step resource groups of this dynamic resource group contain the   primarily lecture slides especially on the topics CSCL, CSCW and   Intelligent Tutoring Systems, which are the last topics of the   lecture that are relevant for the exam. The majority of these step   groups also contain self-test quizzes. There is also a relatively   stable actor group with step actor groups that often form a   bipartite cluster with particular instances of resource group 1. This   indicates that the resources of within this resource group are   considered as most relevant by a large group of students in the   days and weeks before the exam. As in the lecture period, the   found clusters overlap pervasively. Learning resources that occur   more than two times in more than one cluster are:    Lecture slides CSCL    Lecture slides knowledge diagnosis    Wiki article methods and models for human computer  interaction.    Wiki article Fitts law  These resources are used by students irrespectively of the other   resources they use for exam preparation.    Between points in time 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 no clusters can be   found. Resources are only accessed by single persons   sporadically. This can also be observed in Figure 4 between week   15 and 20. This can be explained by the scheduling of the oral   exams. While the most students had their oral exams in the four   weeks after the lecture period, a smaller group of another study   programme had exams after eight weeks. Students of the second   study programme seem to start with exam preparations on earliest   eight days before the exam. This is much less time than students   of the first exam period spend for preparation. Regarding the   exam results, students from the first group tend to get better   grades (1.3 on average) than students from the second group (2.1   on average). Furthermore, the resources accessed by the second   group are different in the beginning of their active phase. Instead   of a dominating group of students that mainly access the lecture   slides for exam preparation as the students in the beginning of the   exam phase, the active students in the late phase of the exam   period can be clustered into small overlapping groups which are   either affiliated to wiki articles or lecture videos, see Figure 8. In   the last time slice most of the students merge to a single group,   but instead forming a bipartite cluster with mostly wiki and video   resources, which would correspond to the merging pattern of the   4th column of table 1, they refocus their learning interest to the   core preparation material (res. group 1) as can be seen in Figure   9.       Figure 8: The student-resource clusters in time slice 13 of the   exam preparation phase.         Figure 9: The evolution of the bipartite subgroups during the   oral examination phase.   6. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK  The analysis of the GILLS course using the proposed methods has   provided us with some useful insights concerning the patterns of   resource usage of the students. By tracing the bipartite student-  resource clusters over time during the lecture period, it turns out   that the majority of the students behave similar. In every week   they access the lecture slides assigned to the topic of that week   and the wiki articles written by other students. Especially the   180    continuous interest in wiki articles created by other students   indicates that the peer review concept does work appropriately. As   described in section 3, the students can earn bonus points for the   exam when they do the group exercises, namely writing and   reviewing wiki articles. The good quality of glossary articles is   indicated by our findings that the articles were used across   exercise groups and in addition to the lecture slides for reworking   the lecture. Some groups of students who often overlap with the   major student group are additionally interested in additionally   provided scientific articles or the lecture videos. Lecture videos   often occur in small bipartite student resource clusters as in Figure   6. Thus, they seem to be used on demand by small groups of   students as additional learning resources or to rework a presence   lecture they had not attended.    During the exam preparation phase we discovered a set of core   learning resources that are accessed by a more or less stable group   of students. By investigating the overlaps between the student-  resource clusters it is possible to identify a small set of learning   material that was being used also by more than one group of   students, see section 5.4. For future instances of the GILLS   course, the course designers should further investigate the role of   these learning materials particularly for exam preparation.    As described in section 5.1 students tend to work with students of   their own study programme. In section 5.4 the analysis results   show that the students of the study programme, for which oral   exams were scheduled later than the exams for the other   programmes, have also different patterns of resource access   during the exam preparation phase. They start preparation late and   are much more focused on lecture videos and wiki articles than   the others. In the future we can tailor the course more specifically   to those distinct learner types.   From the methodological point of view, this paper presented a   modification of the subcommunity tracing method for one-mode   social networks described in [10], so that it can be used to trace   clusters in bipartite networks. The utility of this kind of analysis   for the discovery of characteristic properties of the relations   between students and learning resources was demonstrated. A   major advantage of the proposed analysis in contrast to pure   descriptive analysis of resource access is that one can not only   identify popular and hence potential useful resources, but also   who is affiliated to these resources, and how such affiliations   change over time.    In our further work based on this methodology, we consider   several other applications: In cMOOC-like environments or open   learning platforms such as Khan Academy2 where users are more   or less free in the resources they choose, the tracing of dynamic   learner-resource networks can help to identify learners with   similar learning traces and similar interests. The result could be   used for peer recommendation as in [12]. In blended learning   scenarios, where learning activities take place in the real world as   well as in virtual environments, student groups based on resource   access that are stable over time can be an indicator for group work   in the real world. Research on this can help to develop tools for   better course management in those scenarios. The described   method does not only provide structural information about   learners and their relations to learning resources. Moreover it   reflects learning processes. In environments with predefined   resource access like linear lectures or scenario based inquiry   learning settings; the method can help to verify if students use   resources as intended.

Over the past years, there have been an increase in online course  enrollment among adult learners in order to obtain knowledge or  develop professional skills [6, 17, 38]. However, difficulties  have also been posed by adult learners in taking online courses  due to their lack of time management skills [22].   Time management strategies are increasingly required in the   context of adult learning because they are usually involved in  both their study and job at the same time; therefore, a successful  completion of an online course depends on the efficient use of a  given amount of time. To a considerable degree, it is reported  that failure in an online course for adult learners results from  poor time management [11, 19].   By analyzing adult learners online activity based on  educational data mining, instructors can detect the status of their  learning processes in an earlier stage. Given that most activities  of learners enrolled in online courses occur in a Learning  Management System (LMS), utilizing the log data within the  LMS could provide crucial insight into the learning analytics  field. If we can distinguish the learning patterns in the early  stage of an online course, it will be conducive to encouraging or  guiding learners by providing them with an appropriate  instructional intervention [4].   Log data, which is saved as an unstructured data set, contains  users log information within online systems, and it can be used  to represent how the learning processes occur on the web  throughout the login duration. Furthermore, this information  might be more genuine when compared to the data from  surveys, which rely highly on learners recall and subjective  interpretations; thus, we do not have to consider the possibility  of distortion or low reliability [1, 12]. However, log data alone  cannot be transferred to the learning processes without a  sophisticated interpretation in regards to theoretical aspects. Our  contribution is to suggest an effective way to convert users log  data into predictive indicators of learning performance based on    theoretical background.  The focuses of this study are twofold. First, we elicit  candidates for proxy variables from the log data set that  represent learners time management strategies as conceptual  constructs which have long been considered to be a vital factor  to their performances[2,   26, 31, 34, 42]. Second, we determine  whether the elicited proxy variables predict learner performance  in terms of verifying the empirical validity. If so, the proxy  variables can be used to detect the status of learners time  management and predict performance in other data sets from  similar contexts.    2. PROXY VARIABLES TO REPRESENT  TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IN  LMS  Converting a gigantic data set into proxy variables involves the  following steps (see Fig. 1). First, the targeted conceptual  construct should be discussed based on previous research.  Theories addressed in previous research should dictate the  manipulation of data; further, necessary values, such as learning   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this  work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee  provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or  commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the  full citation on the first page.

Then, proxy variables are elicited through the process.  In essence, by considering the theoretical aspect, we can  determine what should be included from the manipulated values.   The proxy variable, which is not identical to the targeted  conceptual construct but is optimally processed, can be applied  to other data sets. In this study, three variables are chosen on the  basis of previous studies.      Figure 1. A conceptual framework for the construction of a  proxy variable   2.1 Time management strategy   A large body of research argued that time management strategy  is deeply associated with the ability to prioritize tasks [18, 26].  In the study to determine whether time management strategy  attenuate adult learners' strain, Kaufman-Scarborough and  Lindquist [18] perceived prioritizing tasks as an essential factor,  which leads an individual to a value judgment. Jex and Elacqua  [21] reported that the prioritization of tasks is one of key factors  that comprises time management competence of those who well  organize their work. Meanwhile, within the perspective that  regards it as a sub-element of self-regulated learning,  researchers have emphasized the efficient use of time [15, 31,  32, 42]. The concept of the efficient use of time has  incorporated a series of sub-factors, such as sufficient amount of  time investment on tasks and active participation [9, 29, 39]. On  the other hand, a long-range planning has been considered to be  a crucial factor for explaining time management strategy [2, 11].  By sustaining an appropriate amount of time and efforts based  on a well-planned schedule, learners are able to maintain the  expected conditions over the long-term as well as achieve their  expected learning outcome more effectively. In essence, time  management strategy in learning can be defined as an effective  use of time by prioritizing the given tasks while sustaining the  consistent endeavors.     Fig. 2. Selection of three variables.   Fig. 2 presents the relationship between each potential proxy  variable and sub-element of the time management strategy as a  targeted conceptual construct. As learners are required to invest  their time on their study in order to obtain an expected score for  completing the course while still having to work, the amount of  the total login time and the login frequency is regarded, to some  extent, as prioritization of the course over their work. The  assumption is in accordance with previous studies, which regard  time management as a technique for having sufficient time to  accomplish the required tasks [33, 39]. Likewise, the  relationship between regularity of login interval and prioritizing  tasks can be posited if we consider that learners who value the  course are likely to access the LMS regularly in order to obtain  updated information as well as not to get left behind.    2.2 Total login time  The degree to which learners invest their time has been  recognized as a powerful factor correlative with performance;  moreover, much research has reported a strong relationship  existent between the total studying time and performance [37].   In this study, total studying time is represented by the term  total login time, to measure the actual learning time. To  support the significance of the variable, Cotton and Savards  conception of learning time was adopted [7] (see Fig. 3). In the  study, learning time can be categorized into three parts:  Allocated Time (AT), Time-on-Task (TOT) and Academic  learning time (ALT); this conception is illustrated as follows.      Figure 3. Three types of studying time    In this study, the author argued that the three different types of  time mentioned above are significantly correlated with learning  performance. Of course, it is hard to regard login time as  genuine academic learning time because merely logging into  LMS does not necessarily denote meaningful learning in itself.  However, we can easily assume that recorded login time  belongs with the allocated time or time-on-task when  considering that the greatest proportion of learning-related  activities occur within LMS, such as observing lectures,  gathering information, interacting with peers or submitting  assignments.   Therefore, we decided to use the login time to construct the  proxy variable as an indicator standing for the allocated time,  which is an extended concept in which two other types of time  are inherent.    2.3 Login frequency  How frequently learners participate in an online course has been  regarded as an important factor that predicts higher levels of  performance. Piccoli, Ahmad, and Ives [30] reported that  learners login frequency into LMS is highly correlated with  course satisfaction in online learning. Davies and Graff [8]  argued that participation frequency within online activities is  significantly associated with their grades. Kang, Kim, and Park  [20] demonstrated that total login frequency into LMS is  directly connected with not only learning performance, but also  attendance rate.    184    In this study, we assume that the more frequently learners log  into LMS, the more newly updated and shared information they  shall obtain, which is a factor that leads to their better  understanding of the learning content as well as what they must  prepare for classes. The login frequency was calculated by  adding up the number of individual students login time into  LMS.  In this study, we assume that the more frequently learners log  into LMS, the more newly updated and shared information they  shall obtain, a factor which shall lead to their better  understanding of learning content and of what they must   prepare for classes.    2.4 (Ir)regularity of learning interval   Regularity of learning is defined as the extent to which learners  regularly engage in learning, and has been recognized as one of  the time management strategies [10]. Many researchers have  found that the regularity of learning positively predicts learning  performance [28, 35].   In this study, data is calculated into a standard deviation of the  login interval. Thus, it basically indicates the irregularity of  learning interval. To be specific, in the following (see Fig. 4),  the gap between A and B indicates the total course period, and    t1,2 is an interval between the first and second login time  calculated by subtracting t1 from t2. In the same way, we can  obtain nth, the interval which is presented as tn-1, n.  Consequently, the mean of the learners login interval can be  calculated, and the standard deviation is subsequently elicited  from the mean, as indicated in Fig. 5.    Figure 4. Concept of learning interval     Figure 5. Calculation of mean and standard deviation of   learning interval   3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS  The specific research questions are as follows.    R1: How can candidates for proxy variables regarding the  learners time management strategy be elicited from log data   R2: Do the suggested variables (total login time, login  frequency and regularity of login interval) predict adult  learners performance   4. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  4.1 Participants and research context  The participants in this study consisted of 200 adult learners  enrolled in a commercial e-learning course entitled Credit  Derivative administered by a Korean e-learning company. All  participants were engaged in the financial business field as their   full-time job. This course is operated 100% online over a month.  At the end of the course, all participants were required to take a  test.   4.2 Measures and Variables  4.2.1 Suggested independent variables  Log data was collected from the LMS by an automatic  collection module embedded within the system. The Total login  time, Login frequency and (ir)regularity of learning interval  were extracted as independent variables.   4.2.2 Dependent variable  Learning performance, a dependent variable in this study, is  defined as a score of the final test, which consisted of 20  multiple choice items. The scores from each question were  collected and added together in order to obtain the total score.  The total score was graded on a scale of one hundred points.      Table 2. Means, standard deviations of variables (n=200)   Variables Mean Standard deviation   Total login time (hour) 38.18 14.46   Login frequency  46.31 12.56  (Ir)regularity of learning   interval 2.92 2.05   Learning performance 77.92 15.09   4.3 Multiple Linear Regression Analysis  A multiple regression analysis was conducted in order to  determine whether the three suggested values, which serve as  proxy indicators of time management strategy, predict learning  performance. The results are presented in Table 3.   It is shown that the suggested three variables account for 20.8%  of the variance in learning performance (F=36.267, p < .01).  Of these three proxy variables, only (ir)regularity of learning  interval was found to predict learning performance (=-4.343,  t=-10.115, p < .01).     Table 4.

DISCUSSION  The result reveals that only the (ir)regularity of learning interval  factor is proven to predict learning performance.   Indeed, some of the research reported a limited relation between  studying time and learning performance. Ha and colleagues [14],  insisted that total studying time is not related to learning  performance, and Lee [23] highlighted the fact that learning  performance can be increased only when learners are fully  concentrated on what they do, regardless of the total amount of  available time. Similarly, login frequency cannot fully explain  learners meaningful learning. Although learners access LMS  frequently, learners actual studying time might be relatively  short. It is also likely that they intensively log into LMS at a  certain point rather than constantly participating in academic  activities. Such a tendency has been reported to hinder well- planned learning, resulting in either procrastination or a lack of  effective time use [16].  The regularity of the learning interval, meanwhile, can provide  critical evidence as to the fact that learners who more steadily  log into LMS from the beginning of a study to the end show  better performance. This involves neither a temporal access at a  certain point nor merely a one long time visit, but rather a well- intended and conscious learning over a relatively long term. As  a matter of fact, several articles recognize regular participation  as a vital key to success in learning [3, 25, 26, 41]. Given that  the time management strategy has been considered to involve  the learners self-regulation, long-term planning and sustaining  efforts, the regularity of learning is expected to be a strong  indicator of time management strategy.   6. CONCLUSION  This study has made a contribution to learning analytics, within  the context of an adult learners time management strategy  which has been considered to be an essential factor for  successful learning in andragogy [5].    This study shows a process of converting complex log patterns  into elaborated proxy variables based on both a ripe  theoretical foundation and well-intended manipulation. It  demonstrates a possibility of further research regarding the  formation of more sophisticated proxy variables that represent  certain conceptual constructs drawn from an enormous database.  Until now, much research in the learning analytics field has  been conducted in a data-driven way and frequently with scarce  theoretical background [13]. Recently, however, the learning  analytics field has constantly maintained its emphasis on the  learning and teaching areas as well in contrast to its strong root  as a data-driven approach [40]. The social and pedagogical  usage of learning analytics is being actively discussed now, as  researchers search to define it as a separate field by which to  improve learning opportunities away from business area [13, 24].  Along this line, an abundant theoretical foundation is required  for the extensive application of research findings into the real  world context.    This study has limitations as well. We could not track the  specific time use of the learners.  With log data which better  mapped a variety of time use on different menus and web pages,  a more accurate analysis to catch real studying time could have  been made possible. If we can track the learners specific time  use in LMS and thus extract actual studying time from log data  at every moment, it would be possible to more clearly   investigate the relationship between genuine studying time and  learning performance.    7.

As these systems grow more complex, there is an increasing need to incorporate relevant and real-time course-related information that could be predictors of a student's success or failure. This paper presents an investigation of how to incorporate students' use of course resources from a Learning Management System (LMS) into an existing EWS. Specifically, we focus our efforts on understanding the relationship between course resource use and a student's final course grade. Using ten semesters of LMS data from a requisite Chemistry course, we categorized course resources into four categories.

As these systems grow more complex, there is  an increasing need to incorporate relevant and real-time course- related information that could be predictors of a students success  or failure. This paper presents an investigation of how to  incorporate students use of course resources from a Learning  Management System (LMS) into an existing EWS. Specifically,  we focus our efforts on understanding the relationship between  course resource use and a students final course grade. Using ten  semesters of LMS data from a requisite Chemistry course, we  categorized course resources into four categories. We used a  multinomial logistic regression model with semester fixed-effects  to estimate the relationship between course resource use and the  likelihood that a student receives an A or B in the course  versus a C. Results suggest that students who use Exam  Preparation or Lecture resources to a greater degree than their  peers are more likely to receive an A or B as a final grade.  We discuss the implications of our results for the further  development of this EWS and EWSs in general.

INTRODUCTION  Colleges and universities are expanding their use and  development of systems that aggregate multiple sources of student   data (Campbell, DeBlois, & Oblinger, 2007; Siemens & Long,  2011). One class of these systems, Early Warning Systems  (EWSs), are designed to provide information to students,  instructors, advisors, and/or other intermediaries for the purposes  of identifying students in need of academic support (Beck &  Davidson, 2001; Macfayden & Dawson, 2010). As EWSs grow in  use for providing timely information about student performance,  researchers and developers must begin to evaluate the components  ingrained within these systems (Ferguson, 2012).    This paper presents an initial investigation of how to incorporate  additional information from students use of course resources  from a Learning Management System (LMS) into an existing  EWS called Student Explorer (Krumm, Waddington, Teasley, &  Lonn, forthcoming). Student Explorer provides real-time data  from the LMS to academic advisors for use when mentoring  students. Advisors use Student Explorer to make decisions about  which students need the most support. By having an indication of  whether or not students are accessing and using important course  resources, such as practice exams or lecture notes, advisors may  be able to target their interventions for students more effectively.   Our work is guided by two primary research questions: (1) What  is the relationship between student LMS course resource use and  the likelihood that a student receives an A or B in CHEM 100  versus a C and (2) How does the relationship between course  resource use and student grades differ by type of resource  Understanding the relationship between the use of course resource  types and student grades will shed light on whether or not course  resource data are important and how these data could be  incorporated into multiple courses in Student Explorer. We first  outline the current landscape of the development of EWSs within  the learning analytics field before describing Student Explorer.  Then, we detail the course resource LMS data, methods, analyses,  and results of this study. We conclude the paper by discussing the  implications of the results situated in the context of general EWS  development and give consideration to the next steps for  incorporating student course resource use into Student Explorer.   2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK1  2.1 Early Warning Systems Research  Most Learning Analytics (LA)-based systems, including EWSs,  are designed to either provide information directly to students or  to an intermediary who then interacts with students (Krumm et al.,   1 The authors collaborated on this project as members of the USE  Lab at the University of Michigan.

The University of Michigans E2Coach provides  information directly to students about their developing grade in an  introductory Physics course based on demographic and course  performance data (McKay, Miller, & Tritz, 2012). An LA-based  system that provides information to both an intermediary  (instructors) and to students is Purdue Universitys Signals Project  (Campbell, DeBlois, & Oblinger, 2007). Signals combines student  demographic and course performance data into a prediction model  that indicates a students likelihood of failing of a course.    Both of these systems, along with other LA-based systems, are  primed to use an array of information available in LMSs, given  their ubiquitous usage in higher education (Dalhstrom, de Boor,  Grunwald, & Vockey, 2011). In their current form, many EWSs  rely upon prediction models, which combine these sources of  information about into a measure of how a student is going to do.  As we describe below for Student Explorer, one of its values is  that the system provides information of how the student is  currently doing across an array of courses.   Part of our challenge, then, is to incorporate various types of  information related to student course performance across a diverse  set of courses by using a straightforward data mining and  modeling approach. The information also needs to be interpretable  by users. Few, if any, EWSs incorporate the course resources that  students are hitting (viewing, downloading, saving, etc.).  Therefore, we proceed by investigating the relationship between  categories of course resources and student grades in a single  course to first determine whether or not these data matter. Later,  we can consider how resource usage data might be incorporated  and interpreted in a way that is scalable across courses.   2.2 Overview of Student Explorer  Student Explorer is an EWS that provides near real-time data from  the LMS at a large research university to support the existing  work of academic advisors in the STEM (Science, Technology,  Engineering, and Mathematics) Academy (Krumm et al.,  forthcoming). The aim of the STEM Academy is to increase the  academic success of historically underrepresented students in  STEM fields through a holistic student development program  (Krumm et al., forthcoming). Student Explorer was developed  through a two-year collaborative effort between researchers and  the STEM Academys academic advisors and leaders using  principles of design-based research (Cobb, Confrey, diSessa,  Lehrer, & Schauble, 2003; Krumm, et al., forthcoming).   One of the goals of the STEM Academy is to help all of its  students maintain a minimum of a B average in their core  STEM courses. Prior to Student Explorer, advisors relied upon  students self-reported grades during monthly meetings. The  frequency of these meetings combined with the reliance on self- reported grades did not allow for advisors to intervene in as timely  or targeted of a manner as hoped. Therefore, Student Explorer was  developed to more readily allow mentors to identify and engage  students in need of academic support in discussions about their  ongoing performance (Krumm et al., forthcoming).   Student Explorer aggregates grade and course LMS site visit for  each STEM Academy student in all of their courses where the  grade information is stored in the LMS. The grade and site visit  data are aggregated and displayed in a variety of visualizations,  including comparisons of students grades and site visits to their  peers over time. Perhaps the most useful feature reported by the  advisors is a three-level classification scheme that combines  academic performance and site visit data to highlight with color   (red, yellow, green) those students that are in the most immediate  need of support (Krumm, et al., forthcoming).   The classification scheme and information about a students  developing grade in Student Explorer are valuable components for  advisors to quickly identify which students are struggling.  However, the usefulness of displaying LMS data in an EWS goes  well beyond providing a single indicator of student performance.  There is added value in incorporating additional performance- related LMS data into the EWS that would allow advisors or other  users to intervene in a more timely and targeted manner.   3. DATA AND METHODS  3.1 Data Description  STEM Academy advisors primarily focus on providing support  for courses in the STEM fields and Freshmen receive the greatest  degree of support. Therefore, we focus on a first-year prerequisite  chemistry course (hereafter, CHEM 100) in which all STEM  Academy students are enrolled. Our analysis focuses on all  students in CHEM 100, including non-STEM Academy students,  such that any observed relationship between resource use and  grades would be reflective of the population of students in the  course as opposed to a subset that could skew the results.    CHEM 100 is a course designed around student interdependence  and inter-group collaboration where students perform chemistry  experiments in a group learning environment. The primary  objectives of the course include encouraging scientific and critical  thinking through teamwork, experiencing how experimental  results demonstrate various chemical principles, and engaging  students in the process of using the scientific method and  reasoning. Although CHEM 100 is not a core Engineering course,  nor is it focused on content, these objectives suggest that success  in the course will be central to success in future STEM courses.   Prior to our analyses, we classified course resources posted to the  LMS by a structure that could be adapted to changes in resources  over multiple semesters of CHEM 100. Fortunately, the overall  course structure and resources used in CHEM 100 have remained  relatively stable over time. As a result, we were able to classify  the LMS course resources and look at the impacts of their use on a  students grade across ten semesters instead of relying upon one  semester of data. We are thus able to draw conclusions about  categories of course resources over time and can apply these  principles to future investigations of resource use in other  important STEM courses.    We chose to create broader categories of LMS course that allows  us to classify individual resources based on specific keywords.  While much of CHEM 100 takes place in a laboratory setting and  contains several resources related to laboratory assignments, the  course also uses exams and lecture notes. We settled on four  categories of course resources, including: Course Info,  Lecture, Assignments, and Exam Prep. The category names  and corresponding LMS resource titles are displayed in Table 1.   These data contained records of students and course resources  across 10 semesters, from Fall 2007 through Winter 2012. In total,  there were 8,762 students enrolled in CHEM 100 that made  703,191 hits on course resources. We excluded all individuals  receiving a D or Lower as few students received these grades.   3.2 Estimation Strategy  We used a model containing semester fixed-effects to estimate the  relationship between student LMS course resource use on the    189    Table 1. Categories of CHEM 100 LMS Course Resources    Category Resources  Course  Information   Schedules, Course Website, Announcements,  Syllabus, Instructor Information, Course Grades   Lecture   Lecture Notes, Discussion Tools, General  Resources, Online Learning Resources, Lecture  Audio Recordings, Cross Discipline Learning  Objects   Assignments Experiments, Pre-labs, Team Assignments, Team Report Forms, Discussion   Exam  Preparation Sample Exams, Exam Review    likelihood that a student receives an A or B final grade versus  a C in CHEM 100. Functionally, the model takes the form of a  multinomial logistic regression model where the probability of the  two desired outcomes of interest (receiving an A or B in  CHEM 100) are separately compared to the probability of the  undesired outcome of interest (receiving a C in CHEM 100).    Pr[=] Pr[=  ]  =  + 1 + 2 +    3 + 4 +  10=1     In the above equation, the probability that a student  in semester   receives an A in CHEM 100 as compared to a C is a function  of their within-course percentile rank in the use of various  categories of course resources (Course Info, Lecture,  Assignments, and Exam Prep). The within-course percentile rank  of each course resource use category is (1) normed to their peers  use of the same resources and (2) mitigates against severe  skewness or any outliers in the distribution that may occur from  students who access the same resources multiple times.   We included semester fixed-effects ( 10=1 ) in our model to  account for unobserved variation that occurs between semesters.  Pooling together the CHEM 100 data from multiple semesters  helps to uncover a trend in resource use over time. While we  modeled the variation in course resource use and grades over  time, semester fixed-effects control for those factors potentially  related to the relationship between course resource use and grades  that change across semesters but are not observed in our data.  These factors include, but are not limited to differences in student  ability and any instructor-related factors such as teaching  effectiveness or encouraging the use of resources in the LMS.    By including semester fixed-effects, we estimate the within- semester relationship between a given students course resource  use and the likelihood of receiving a certain course grade. Thus,  1 through 4 represent our estimates of interest. We present our  results in terms of odds-ratios, or a comparison of the likelihood  of receiving an A (or B) versus a C in CHEM 100. Thus, 1  is the within-semester estimate of a one-percentile increase in the  use of Course Information resources on the likelihood that a  student receives an A versus a C. We estimate the impacts of  each of the categories of course resources separately and then  combine all the categories in the preferred model displayed above.    4. RESULTS  4.1 Descriptive Results  We first describe the distribution of students and grades across  semesters. Table 2 describes the students enrolled in CHEM 100   across ten semesters. We combined all variations of a grade in the  same letter category (e.g. B includes all B+, B, B- grades).   Table 2. Description of CHEM 100 Students    Mean Min Max  Number of Students 968 467 1,348  Mean Resource Hits 72.2 45.2 97.5  % A Grades 20.5 17.3 24.4  % B Grades 57.5 50.0 63.0  % C Grades 22.0 13.5 30.7  Statistics calculated using ten semesters of CHEM 100 data.   More students enrolled in the course during fall semesters than  winter semesters. The numbers of students in fall semesters were  relatively stable over five years, while enrolment numbers in  winter semesters nearly doubled from the Winter 2010 to Winter  2011 semesters. On average, 968 students were enrolled in the  course per semester, with averages of 1,289 students in the fall  semesters and 647 students in the winter semesters. The average  number of resource hits per student was the highest in the Fall  2011 semester, and the lowest in Winter 2011, ranging from 45.2  to 97.5 hits, with a mean of 72.2 across all semesters. These  values are proportional to the total number of resources available  for students to access, indicating that the characteristics of the  course resources change across semesters although the categories  align well across semesters regardless of the number of resources.  The percentages of students receiving each letter grade were  relatively stable across the semesters. The overall mean  distribution of grades was 20.5% of students receiving an A,  57.5% a B and 22.0% a C or Less.    We next describe how the number of mean number of course  resources accessed varies by final student grade (by category  across all semesters) in Table 3. The results suggest that students  receiving better grades in the course (As or Bs) have a  higher mean number of course resource hits in comparison to  those students who receive a B or C. Assignments  resources were accessed the most across all grade groups,  followed by Exam Preparation resources.   Table 3. Mean Course Resource Hits by Final Grade   Resource  Category   A  Grades   B  Grades   C  Grades   Course Info 3.94  [6.66]   3.40  [5.32]   3.27  [5.49]   Lecture 6.64  [12.35]   5.57  [11.29]   5.15  [10.18]   Assignments 57.18  [40.30]   48.75  [32.89]   38.91  [29.21]   Exam Prep 18.74  [16.25]   14.82  [14.79]   12.78  [14.33]   All Resources 86.49  [57.50]   72.55  [48.15]   60.11  [43.02]   Standard deviations in brackets.   The standard deviations of the raw number of resource accesses  are large, indicative of students accessing the same course  resources multiple times in the LMS (as opposed to downloading  once and saving). Thus, we use the percentile rank of each  students resource use. The current version of Student Explorer  uses percentile ranks for general LMS course site visits, because  STEM Academy advisors have found it easiest metric to make  sense of which students are accessing the course site frequently  versus those in the bottom quartile.   190    4.2 Multinomial Logistic Regression Results  We used a multinomial logistic regression model with semester  fixed-effects to estimate the relationship between course resource  and a students final grade. Table 4 reflects a model where each  resource category is included in a separate regression model.   Table 4. Impact of Resource Use on Grades -   Separate Analyses by Resource Category   Resource  Category A vs. C B vs. C   Course Info  1.008*** 1.003***  Lecture 1.017*** 1.007***  Assignments 1.012*** 1.004***  Exam Prep 1.026*** 1.016***      Semester FE Y Y  N 9,679 9,679  ~p<0.100, *p<0.050, **p<0.010, ***p<0.001. Results  are interpreted as odds-ratios, representing the change  in the likelihood of receiving an A (B) versus a  C for each one-percentile increase in resource use.   We found a general positive relationship between increased use of  each type of resource category and final student grades, meaning  that as resource use increases, a given student is more likely to  receive an A (or B) instead of a C in CHEM 100 within a  given semester. The impacts are stronger for A students in  comparison to B students. Exam Preparation resource use has  the largest estimated relationship with course grades, while  Course Information resource use has the smallest. All of the  estimates are statistically significant at the =0.001 level.   Although the separate analyses by category yield a glimpse of the  relationships between resource use and grades, less biased  estimates of these relationships were obtained by combining all  resource categories in the same model. Table 5 displays the  estimates of the preferred multinomial logistic regression model.   Table 5. Impact of Resource Use on Grades -   Combined Analysis with All Resource Categories   Resource  Category A vs. C B vs. C   Course Info 0.993*** 0.996**  Lecture 1.008*** 1.000  Assignments 0.999 0.997  Exam Prep 1.024*** 1.018***      Semester FE Y Y  N 9,679 9,679  ~p<0.100, *p<0.050, **p<0.010, ***p<0.001. Results  are interpreted as odds-ratios.   There remains a positive and statistically significant (p<0.001)  relationship between Exam Preparation resource use and  receiving an A or B versus a C in CHEM 100 within a  given semester. This result holds even after simultaneously  controlling for all other relationships between resource use and  final grades. Increased Lecture resource use is slightly  positively and statistically significantly (p<0.001) related to the  likelihood of receiving an A versus a C in the course, but is  not significant for receiving a B versus a C. The relationship  between Course Information resources and final grades is  slightly negative, and there is not a statistically significant  relationship between Assignment resource use and final grades.   At first glance, these estimates seem miniscule. Taking the  estimate of Exam Preparation on grades, for example, for each  one percentile point increase in Exam Preparation resource use,  a student is 1.024 times as likely to receive an A instead of a  C. At face value, the point estimate is small; however, it only  reflects a one percentile point increase in resource use.   To better illustrate the relationship between increased resource use  and final student grades, we describe the scenario of a student in  the course that could receive feedback about their performance  from a STEM Academy advisor using Student Explorer. A few  weeks into the course, this student is observed with a low grade  and is at the 25th percentile (bottom quartile) of resource use in  each category compared to their classmates. As an actionable step,  the STEM Academy advisor could suggest using more of the  courses resources, particularly those of a given category. We can  use these models to estimate the students likelihood of receiving  an A or B versus a C if they were to improve their resource  use and hypothetically shift to the 50th percentile (median) from  the bottom quartile. Table 6 presents these likelihoods for the  statistically significant estimates of resource use in the model.   Table 6. Changing Percentiles of Resource Use on Grades  Resource  Category   A vs. C  25th50th   B vs. C  25th50th   Course Info 0.856 0.907  Lecture 1.228 not sig.  Assignments not sig. not sig.  Exam Prep 1.811 1.565   For a student that shifts their use of Exam Preparation  resources from the bottom quartile of the class to the median, they  are estimated to become 1.81 times as likely to receive an A in  the course instead of a C than if they did not change their  resource use patterns previously. Likewise, that same student is  1.57 times as likely to receive a B than previously (see Figure 1  below for graphical interpretation). Students shifting their use of  Lecture resources to the median are estimated to become 1.23  times as likely to receive an A than previously.    Figure 1. Exam Preparation Resource Use and Final Grades        5. DISCUSSION  5.1 Conclusions and Implications  Our first research question asked: What is the relationship  between student LMS course resource use and the likelihood that  a student receives an A or B in CHEM 100 versus a C The  results indicate that course resource use is related to course grades  over ten semesters, even after accounting for any unobserved  time-varying factors related to the relationship between course   Percentile of Resource Use   Pr ob  ab ili  ty  o  f R ec  ei vi  ng  G  ra de     191    resource use and grades. Furthermore, we determined that the  increased use of Exam Preparation resources had the strongest  positive relationship with grades, while the use of Lecture  resources was also positively correlated with receiving an A in  CHEM 100. These results answered our second research question.   Our results are initially suggestive of a pattern for success in  CHEM 100 through the use of Exam Preparation and Lecture  resources. This flexible framework to categorize resources,  affords us the opportunity to apply this framework to additional  courses. We might hypothesize that the use of resources related to  Exam Preparation and Lecture would be important across  STEM courses (particularly required first- and second-year  courses), and the creation of resource categories allows us to  actually test this hypothesis.   For CHEM 100 these results held across semesters. Although the  overall course structure remained the same, the instructors and  resources available to students changed with each semester. This  scenario would apply more broadly across all STEM courses:  instructors and resources will change over time. This is  problematic for incorporating resource use in an individualized,  course-by-course manner into an EWS. However, our resource  categorization framework can help to group resources across  courses, thereby reducing the burdens placed on developers of  LA-based systems, as well as the instructors and advisors that  make sense of these data. For Student Explorer, the categorization  approach may allow for the inclusion of resource use across all  STEM courses in Student Explorers classification system. This  would replace general LMS course site visits and highlight to the  advisors more targeted ways in which students can improve.   5.2 Limitations and Future Work  We are limited in our ability to speak about the relationship  between course resource use and student grades more generally  because this study used only one course. This is the first phase of  investigating how LMS course resource use could be incorporated  into an existing EWS. Also, this paper is meant to serve as a  springboard for future research and fodder for discussion at this  early phase of the design and improvement process.   We have several thoughts about how to expand this work in the  future. We need to be mindful of other approaches for aggregating  LMS course resource use data. Using percentile ranks allows for  peer-to-peer comparisons and protects against some outliers, but  is not a perfect metric. Some students may use the resources as  effectively as their peers but download and save the resource to  their hard drives, which would represent one access in the LMS.  We will need to consider alternative metrics, including the  proportion of materials used within each resource category, as  well as a weighting scheme to reduce the influence of the number  of accesses. Also, not all courses may use materials falling  directly into our resource categories (e.g., studio-based design  courses), so we must be flexible with our categorization scheme.   Our next steps involve expanding this analysis to other required  first-year STEM courses across multiple semesters. We will also  need to examine how the relationship between resource use and  grades changes during the semester (i.e. before and after exams),  in order to better focus advisors recommendations to students.  We also need to incorporate additional data (e.g. demographics,  ACT scores) with resource use into our classification scheme in  order to determine the overall added value of this information.   6.

INTRODUCTION  This article addresses a relatively unexplored area in the emerging  field of learning analytics, the design of learning analytics  interventions. As technology integration research has long shown,  successful introduction of educational innovations is never simply   a matter of providing access to new tools, no matter how useful  [11, 16]. Without a plan for shifting patterns of teaching and  learning activity, new technologies often remain ancillary to the  teaching and learning process, either used tangentially to  marginally enhance existing practices or often simply collecting  dust on the virtual shelf [12]. If learning analytics are to truly  make an impact on teaching and learning and fulfill expectations  of revolutionizing education, we need to consider and design for  ways in which they will impact the larger activity patterns of  instructors and students.     A learning analytics intervention is defined as the surrounding  frame of activity through which analytic tools, data, and reports  are taken up and used. It is a soft technology in that it involves the  orchestration of human processes, and does not necessarily  require the creation of a material artifact (though one may be  created to support representation or implementation of the  process) [2, 22]. To date, most research and development in  learning analytics has focused on the fundamental issues of data  collection, management, processing and display, addressing the  two core challenges of how to determine meaningful traces of  learning and present them in a form that will be useful to decision  makers [15]. However, as we enter a stage in which analytic  systems are rapidly being rolled out for more general use, the  design of the intervention surrounding activity with the analytics  becomes a critical element for supporting the effective  implementation of these tools. Specifically, learning analytics  intervention design is concerned with addressing questions such  as: when in the teaching and learning process should analytics be  consulted (at what points, with what frequency); who should be  accessing particular kinds of analytics (teachers, students,  teachers and students together, instructional aides); why are they  being consulted (what questions are they answering, how will this  information be used); and most importantly, how the use of the  analytics articulates with the rest of the teaching and learning  practices taking place (what is the context for interpreting and  acting on the information the analytics provide).   In this paper, I first make the case for the overall importance of  intervention design and situate it within the larger landscape of  the learning analytics field. I then move to specifically consider  the issue of intervention design for student use of learning  analytics, explaining why attention to students as users of  analytics is valuable and why it is necessary to support students in  this activity. The latter part of the paper presents a set of  principles and processes that can be used by teachers and course  developers to design pedagogical interventions that support the  productive use of learning analytics by students. Finally, these  principles and processes are united in a preliminary model of  pedagogical learning analytics intervention design for students.

LOCATING PEDAGOGICAL  INTERVENTION DESIGN IN THE  LANDSCAPE OF LEARNING ANALYTICS  The field of learning analytics is broadly concerned with how the  collection, analysis and application of data can be used to  improve processes and outcomes related to learning [21, 37].  While much initial work has necessarily attended to developing  technical solutions to the challenges of data capture, processing  and display, there is general acknowledgement that analytics  exist as part of a socio-technical system where human decision- making and consequent actions are as much a part of any  successful analytics solution as the technical components [41,  p4]. As with all socio-technical systems, the various technical and  social components are fundamentally interrelated, and thus  success requires joint optimization of the whole [40]. In this vein,  my focus in this paper is not on the technical aspects of extracting  or presenting analytics (though clearly these are important  elements of any effective learning analytics solution), but the  elements framing how activity using such analytics is motivated  and mobilized for productive use. I thus introduce the notion of  learning analytics interventions as the organization of the human  processes through which analytic tools, data, and reports are taken  up as part of some larger educational activity. More specifically,  as explained below, pedagogical learning analytics interventions  are those interventions in which the educational activity expressly  includes instructional, studying or other components such that the  use of analytics has a direct and immediate impact on teaching  and learning processes. Finally, the concept of pedagogical  learning analytics intervention design then refers to systematic  efforts to incorporate the use of analytics as a productive part of  teaching and learning practices in a given educational context.  Additionally, pedagogical learning analytics interventions can  also be designed to be educative in nature [13] such that they help  teachers and students to develop general understandings about  ways that analytics can be helpful to their teaching and learning  practices.   2.1 Classes of Learning Analytics and the  Need for Pedagogical Intervention Design  Within the broad space of learning analytics, distinctions can be  made between different kinds of analytics based on the types of  data collected, characteristics users, and the kinds of decision  making conducted [17]. At a macro level, administrators can use  analytics as input for making programmatic decisions and to  identify at-risk students. Often referred to as academic analytics  [38], the data involved generally represents various high-level  outcomes such as completion or overall achievement levels [8]  and can be aggregated in various ways depending on purpose (i.e.  student, class, department, institution etc.). Academic analytics  involve relatively long time-cycles, using data from completed  activities (courses, programs, etc.) to inform decisions about  future ones. While the general notion of learning analytics  interventions applies here, it is related to questions of workflow  rather than direct teaching and learning processes per se; for  example at what points in the administrative and advising process  of an institution (or company) should analytics be consulted and  how can this be usefully systematized as part of normal business  practices. Such interventions are important for the use of analytics  to support the educational enterprise in a broad sense, but would  not be considered pedagogical in the sense described above.   In contrast, at a micro level learners and teachers using learning  analytics are more likely to be interested in process data that can  help them make better decisions about the learning event in which  they are currently engaged [10]. In this case, the relevant data  relates to tracking learning and an important element for  interpretation and action is having a model of learning for the  particular environment - i.e. a research-based framework for  understanding what productive activity in the learning context  looks like. In some cases the model may be specified such that  analytics data is processed and interpreted according to some  system of rules leading to automatic changes in the learning  system [e.g. 32]. In other cases, data may be processed into  categories according to a model, but then presented to  stakeholders to support decision making [e.g. 23]. In a third  situation, the data may be processed and presented in a manner  agnostic to any particular model of learning and it remains to the  user to make connections between the information provided and  valued aspects of the learning activity.    In both of the latter two situations, several locally contextualized  questions of interpretation and action arise, making the process of  using the information provided by the analytics to guide effective  decision-making decidedly non-trivial. First there is the question  of making sense of the information that is provided; this involves  basic issues of validity in terms of the appropriateness of  inferences that can be made from particular data given the context  in which it was generated and the ways in which it was processed.  This inherently requires a theoretical component that explains  what concept or construct the analytic represents and what its  relevance and relationship to other concepts and constructs is  hypothesized to be, since without such a mapping the measure  does not have any meaning beyond itself [31]. Thus at its heart,  interpreting analytics is a process of knowing how to ask useful  questions of the data and find relevant answers [6, 43]. Practically  this means that an analytics user must have an understanding of  the pedagogical context in which the data was generated,  knowledge of what particular analytics are meant to indicate, and  an appreciation of how these relate to the learning goals of the  situation [28]. During the interpretive process it is also important  to keep in mind what information is not provided by the analytics,  to avoid the danger of over-optimizing to that which can be  measured at the expense of valued, but unmeasured entities [10,  15].   In addition to the conceptual task of making sense of the  information provided by analytics, a second major challenge for  analytics users is incorporating the process of interpreting and  acting on analytics productively into the flow of learning  activities. While this might initially be conceived of as a practical  challenge, in fact it ties in to many of the conceptual questions  described above in terms of over what time period is it valid to  make certain kinds of inferences and when it is appropriate to take  action on them. It also relates to the social dynamics of the  learning environment in terms of who has the authority (and the  responsibility) for particular kinds of decision-making at certain  points in time, as well as how the use of the analytics can be made  to articulate productively with (rather than fight against or exist in  isolation of) the rest of the teaching and learning practices taking  place. These kinds of questions, as well as the issues of  interpretive frame described above, can be addressed and  supported through pedagogical learning analytics intervention  design.    204    2.1.1 Pedagogical Interventions for Teachers  Many of the core issues related to teacher use of learning  analytics were recently reviewed by Lockyer and colleagues [28].  Their solution to the challenges of interpretation and activity flow  was to align learning analytics with the process of learning  design. This creates a unified cycle in which teachers document  their pedagogical intentions through learning design, which then  provides the conceptual frame for asking questions of and making  sense of the information provided by the analytics [14].  Specifically, Lockyer and colleagues highlight the importance of  identifying ahead of time what activity patterns would be  expected for successful (or unsuccessful) student engagement in  the pedagogical design, and using tools such as checkpoint and  process analytics to look for these at particular points during the  learning activity [28]. This is important because the same pattern  of activity in a system may be considered more or less productive  depending on the activity design; for example a wheel and spoke  social network in a discussion forum may be appropriate for a Q  & A session with an instructional expert, but problematic if the  goal is to build community among a group of learners [5]. By  addressing the questions of interpretive frame and activity flow,  Lockyer and colleagues model describes a pedagogical  intervention by which teachers can engage in systematic efforts to  use analytics as a productive part of their everyday teaching  practice [28]. Certainly other pedagogical interventions to support  teacher use of learning analytics are also possible; however, this is  currently one of the few models that has been described with any  degree of specificity.   2.1.2 Pedagogical Interventions for Students  In contrast to teacher use, intervention design for students has  received less attention; in many cases it seems to be assumed that  simply providing well designed analytics will be enough to induce  productive use. However there are several factors that work  against this. One particular concern is that students are often not  privy to their instructors pedagogical intentions, and thus  unaware of both the learning goals for an educational activity and  what productive patterns of engagement in it (as indicated by the  analytics) would look like. Another challenge for students is the  strong metacognitive skills needed to use analytics as a tool for  reflection and self-regulation [9]. While teachers may have had  preparation or experience in being a reflective practitioner [34]  students often struggle as self-regulated learners.  The challenges of comprehending pedagogical intent, recognizing  productive patterns of activity, and activating self-regulatory  skills suggest that on their own students are unlikely to know how  or why to engage with analytics; but they also present  opportunities for making students more active partners in  managing their own learning. Specifically, how students  participate in an educational activity can relate to their  understanding of the activity and its purpose [26]; thus sharing  pedagogical intent increases the potential for purposeful  alignment between student behavior and instructional purpose. In  addition, being proactively involved and engaged in directing  ones own learning is thought to support better learning processes  and outcomes more generally [4, 48], thus helping students to  develop these as part of their use of analytics can have continued  benefits in other academic areas, especially with the rise of more  personalized modes of learning that place greater responsibility  on the individual learner. Finally giving students the opportunity  to be a part of directing their own course for learning can help the   analytics serve as an agent of empowerment rather than  enslavement.   In the context of these potential benefits, this paper specifically  address questions about intervention design for student use of  learning analytics and presents a set of pedagogical principles and  processes that can be used by teachers and course developers to  support the productive use of learning analytics by students.  While the traces, analytics, and particular learning analytics  intervention required in any given situation are specific to that  context, a pedagogical model for framing interpretive activity by  students can be described in terms of general principles and  processes that can be applied to a variety of learning contexts.    3. PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES FOR  PEDAGOGICAL LEARNING ANALYTICS  INTERVENTION DESIGN  As defined above, the pedagogical design of learning analytics  interventions relates to the soft elements framing how activity  using analytics is mobilized for productive use. This is a new area  of inquiry; as such there is limited prior work directly addressing  the challenges and opportunities for learning analytics  interventions laid out above. Thus, the following principles and  processes were developed as an initial framework to provide a  starting point for design and research. This guidance was  generated through a dialectical process, drawing on theories from  education (specifically constructivism, meta-cognition, and self- regulated learning [e.g. 33, 36]), while considering the central  analytics intervention questions of interpretation and action, as  well as several more specific concerns such as transparency,  rigidity/flexibility, and the hegemony of that which is measured  [8, 10, 15]. This approach follows the tradition in the fields of  both education and human-computer interaction of generating  theoretically-motivated design models that can then be applied,  tested, and refined iteratively [3, 39]. The model of pedagogical  intervention design was also informed by our own process of  iterative development in the initial implementation of a learning  analytics application for online discussions [45]. Lessons learned  through this design process included the power of dialogue to  engage students and the lack of need for parity in how instructors  and students interacted with the analytics. Data collected from the  implementation is currently being analyzed, and will be used to  provide further insight into the principles and processes.  Validation of the model will happen over time as it is applied,  adjusted and further developed by ourselves and others in the  learning analytics community.   3.1 Principle 1: Integration   The principle of Integration is central to the basic notion of  pedagogical intervention design. That is, pedagogical intervention  design is about intentionally providing a surrounding frame for  the activity through which analytic tools, data, and reports are  taken up, while the principle of Integration states that this  surrounding frame should position the use of analytics as an  integral part of course activity tied to goals and expectations. This  principle specifically addresses the challenge of helping students  understand pedagogical intent and helps prevent against rigidity  of interpretation by providing a local context for making sense of  the data. It also supports the integration of analytics uses into  activity flow of the learning environment. Finally, it provides an  avenue for tailoring analytics use such that the same analytics  suite can be useful in different ways in different contexts.   205    The basic idea of Integration is that the use of learning analytics  needs to be conceived of as an element of the learning design  itself, and that students need to understand these connections.  This means that in planning a learning event, the instructor or  learning designer must decide which metrics (of the ones  provided by whatever system is being used) will be focused on in  a particular situation based on the purpose of the educational  activity, and identify what productive and unproductive patterns  in these metrics are expected to look like. This planning stage  connects to the notion of aligning learning analytics with learning  design as part of the pedagogical intervention model for teachers  discussed above [28].   In addition to choosing metrics and predicting patterns, there are  two key additional elements of pedagogical learning analytics  intervention design needed specifically for students. The first  additional element is a plan for sharing the logic of connection  between the learning analytics and learning activity with the  students, so the thread between goals, actions and feedback is  clear. This is conceptualized as a process of Grounding and is  expanded on below in Section 3.1.1.  The second additional element is considering when and how it  makes sense for the students to work with the chosen analytics in  relation to the activity flow of the learning environment. In some  cases (for example with learners experienced in self-regulation), it  may be fine to provide students with context at the start of a  learning experience and leave them on their own to decide when  to integrate such use of the analytics into their individual learning  processes. However, in many cases it can be helpful (or even  necessary) to provide guidance to students about when the  analytics might usefully be consulted. This can be put into  practice through determining a schedule or timescale for  checkpoints that makes sense for the activity at hand. The issue of  temporal integration is discussed further under the processes of  Goal-Setting and Reflection in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.    3.1.1 Process 1: Grounding  There are three elements that students need to understand in order  to effectively use analytics as part of their larger participation in a  learning activity: (1) the purpose of the learning activity, (2) the  characteristics of what is considered productive engagement in  the activity, and (3) how the learning analytics provided serve as a  representation of this. These kinds of understanding can be  developed in multiple ways. For example, depending on the  parameters of the learning context (student maturity, class size,  blended or fully online format, time available etc.) the goals of an  educational activity might be simply presented and explained to  students, or could be jointly determined by the instructor and  students together. Similarly, the characteristics of productive  engagement in the activity could be brainstormed and then  finalized by the group, or simply supplied to students with a  rationale. Both of these activities (which aim towards a shared  understanding of purpose and process among teacher and  students) are actually useful for supporting learners in engaging in  desired ways in an activity even before the analytics are  introduced and can reasonably be enacted in a variety of ways in  both face-to-face and digital settings. In addition, there is a need  to tie the analytics available to the agreed-on qualities of  productive engagement; the depth to which the calculation details  of the different metrics are explained and considered will vary  depending on the level of students, time available and perceived  value. In each of the elements described here there is a trade-off  between efficiency of presentation and depth of student   engagement, but regardless the goal of the grounding process is to  develop a shared understanding about the qualities of productive  participation in the activity as a context for interpreting the  analytics.  There is one additional important point to be made here and that  is that connecting the analytics available to the qualities of  productive engagement is a useful exercise not only for students  to see what metrics serve as indicators of, but also to highlight  any qualities of productive engagement that may not be captured  by the metrics. One important concern in using learning analytics  is that the analytics alone will dictate how people engage in the  learning activity and thus we can become what we measure,  even though the metrics only capture some aspects of the overall  activity [10,15]. For this reason, it is important for students to be  aware of what the analytics they are using do not capture. It is  also helpful to use multiple diverse measures so no one analytic  becomes the sole focus of attention [46].  To give a concrete example of what the principle of integration  and process of grounding might look like, take the analytics  system Uatu designed to visualize collaborative writing process in  Google Docs [30]. The system continuously collects and stores  edit and revision data about user contributions, changes in  document size, and time from Google Docs in order to support  formative assessment of collaboration between learners. The  visualizations generated from the data base contain the document  revisions as they occurred over time, presenting who made certain  revisions, when the revisions happened, the size of the  contribution, and the time spent.  Imagining a pedagogical intervention design for the use of this  tool as part of an online post-secondary history course, the  instructor might first introduce the purpose of collaborative  writing in this context to develop content knowledge and  understanding of the core issues surrounding the subject through  continued expansion on key themes over the course of the term.  She then could provide students with clear guidelines for what is  expected and will be evaluated; for example, the frequency and  size of the contributions, and the quality of the contributions.  Finally, the analytics can be introduced in this context, with the  instructor describing how the feedback visualizes the  collaborative construction of the document and how it relates to  the participation criteria. For example, the instructor might  encourage students to add to the document by identifying or  adding to a theme on a weekly basis as they move through the  semester and give a sense of how much elaboration (size) she  expects from each contribution. The Uatu system currently does  not provide metrics for quality, so this would need to be discussed  as an element important for the activity, although absent in the  metrics. In situations where the analytic tool used does provide  information about the content of contributions, this could also be  discussed. In this manner, the analytics are introduced as  information which has clear meaning in the context of this  particular collaborative writing activity. In an alternate context,  with other students, and another kind of writing activity, the same  analytics suite could be productively motivated with a different  intervention design.   3.2 Principle 2: Agency  Learning is an activity that needs students proactive engagement   in order to be successful [48] and one of the key attractions of  learning analytics is the possibility to support the learner in  actively taking charge of managing their own learning process   206    [20]. The principle of Agency is thus targeted at promoting  learning analytics interventions that that support, rather than  detract from, students development and use of self-regulatory  skills. This also addresses concerns about analytics being yet  another master for students to serve, rather than a tool of  empowerment. In thinking about student agency, there are two  important elements to consider: first, agency in interpreting the  analytics (what does the information provided mean, how does it  relate to what is important to me in this situation); and second,  agency in in responding to the measure (what actions will I take  as a result of the information provided). These elements are each  addressed through the processes of Goal-Setting and Reflection.   3.2.1 Process 2: Goal-Setting   In self-regulation, learners guide their learning process by setting  goals and working actively to attain them [36]. Goals can  motivate learners to put in greater efforts for anticipated self- satisfaction and also incite self-monitoring of their achievement.  Self-set goals especially lead to higher self-efficacy which  influences the amount of effort learners make and their  commitment to fulfill the challenges [49]. However, learners need  guidance to make sure they set up proximal and specific goals  with a proper level of difficulty to enhance learning [35]. It may  seem that this discussion is superfluous since after developing a  shared understanding about the purpose of an educational activity  and the qualities of productive participation, students would all  have the same goal of maximizing each of these qualities.  However such an assumption is overly simplistic since students  always have the possibility to set their own goals for a learning  activity; some in line with the instructional goals for the activity,  others less so [9]. In addition, each student has a different starting  place and skill set that they bring to their learning, so even to  reach the same end-state they may each have different aspects of  the learning task that require more attention than others. This  suggests the need for multiple possible profiles of productive  activity and improvement, rather than a single goal and path  which all students must follow.  For these reasons, a key element of student agency in learning  analytics begins with individual goal setting to provide a  personalized context for sense-making of the analytics. By  making personalized goal-setting an explicit and structured part of  the learning activity, learners are asked to be purposeful in  thinking about the stated activity goals, evaluating their own  strengths and weaknesses, and setting specific and proximal  targets to work towards. Importantly, the process of goal-setting  should be tied to and follow from the introduction of the learning  activity purpose and characteristics indexed by the learning  analytics as described above in the Integration principle. In this  way, learning analytics can support the generation of specific and  proximal goals since they provide clear indices for target-setting.  The actual process of goal-setting does not have to take place  directly within the learning analytics system; however there are  several advantages to doing so, principally the opportunity to  support initial goal-setting and the ease of continual reference  when the analytics are being reviewed. These possibilities are  illustrated by nStudy, a web-based toolkit designed to support  learners in studying online content by annotating it (e.g. creating  tags, notes, and terms with definitions) and linking these  information objects together to build up concept maps and the like  [44]. While efforts to develop learning analytics for the system  are still in progress, nStudy already supports learners in setting  goals through a form that prompts them for a description and   provides tools for indicating importance, difficulty, target date,  current state of completion. An instructor using nStudy in their  teaching might structure explicit use of this goal-setting  functionality into certain points in the term, for example requiring  students to set goals at the start of each segment of the course. In  using such a tool possibilities also exist for sharing information  about the aggregated goals of the class as a whole. Whether this is  beneficial or detrimental for goal-setting and learning remains an  open research question. Goals notes in nStudy are also easily  retrieved, updated and linked to other objects in the system. Once  the analytics features of the system are made available, reports or  a dashboard could also be linked to the goals notes, facilitating  reflection on the analytic metrics in the context of specific  objectives and purposes.   3.2.2 Process 3: Reflection  Once set, goals drive how students interact with educational  materials and activities and the feedback the analytics provides  becomes an important moderator for students to monitor and  assess their progress towards their goals [27], as well as evaluate  when the goals themselves need to be updated or revised. This  collection of activities involves looking back at information about  the learning activities recently engaged in and, as such, is a form  of data-informed reflection. From a constructivist perspective,  reflection has long been thought of as an essential part of  constructing ones understanding; in turn, as ones understanding  develops, reflection can also be used more effectively to support  learning [29]. However, reflection has traditionally depended on  the learners own recollection of the activities they engaged in,  which research has shown is not particularly good [42]. Thus  learning analytics offer an important advantage in supporting the  process of reflection based on more accurate data.  However, as with goal setting, students need support in knowing  when and how to reflect on their analytics and take action based  on them. This is particularly important because online activities  that can happen at anyplace and anytime often happen nowhere  and never [24]; conversely attention to constantly available  analytics can draw away from engagement in the activity itself.  Thus to support productive reflective activity, explicit time, space  and guidance need to be provided for reflection on analytics.   Time can be strongly structured by making reflection a specific  course activity itself, or organized more softly through suggested  guidelines provided to students. It is important to provide  analytical feedback fast enough to impact practice [7] but also on  a scale for which the analytics make sense to examine in a  particular context. Especially for analytics that track larger scale  constructs, the time-frame over which the data is examined can  dramatically affect the results [47]. The frequency with which the  analytics are provided or accessed and with which reflective  activity is engaged in will vary depending on the context, but the  goal of setting up specific timing is to avoid overwhelming  students or making them overly reliant or fixated on the analytics  [8].   The notion of a dedicated space for reflection also supports the  actual enactment of the process as well as storing learners  reflective trajectory so they can look back at their learning  progress over time. With historical records learners are able to  notice their improvement (or lack thereof), monitor their goals  and obtain a larger picture of their engagement with the learning  activity. A variety of technologies can be used to create reflective  spaces; the most obvious choice is perhaps a blog format where   207    learners can articulate, refine and reflect their thoughts, ideas and  opinions by writing in a journal [18]; however a wiki can also be  used effectively for this purposed [45]. Both blogs and wikis also  provide for the possibility of interactivity among learners or  between a learner and the instructor, and thus have the ability to  turn the reflective journal writing into a collective or dialogical  activity [1]. This topic will be addressed further under the  principle of Dialogue below.  Finally, learners need guidance in the process of how to reflect.  Much of this guidance can take the form of just-in-time reminders  to look back at their goals, consider their previous analytics, and  think about where they are making progress and where more  effort is needed. Reflective guidance can also be seeded through  specific reflection questions or a structured reflective process if  desired. Another possibility is to integrate support for reflection  into the analytics system or include analytics on the reflective  process itself. Such an approach has been followed with the  EnquiryBlogger system which supports reflective journaling by  encouraging students to tag their entries with a set of valued  learning dispositions (e.g. critical curiosity, strategic awareness)  and then provides them with visual analytics reflecting these  perceptions of their learning power [7].   3.3 Principle 3: Reference Frame  In addition to the two central principles of Integration and  Agency, there are two other principles for intervention design to  support the productive use of analytics. The first is the principle  of Reference Frame. A reference frame is simply the comparison  point to which students orient when they examine their analytics.  Two reference frames have already been discussed in the course  of this paper. The first is the theoretical patterns of activity  described as productive by the course instructor, which serve as  an absolute reference point for comparison. The second is a  students own prior activity, which serves as a relative reference  point for comparison. Depending on the context of the analytics  use, an instructor may choose to emphasize one over the other.  A third reference frame that can be used is that of other students  in the course. Aggregated information about the performance of  others students is often provided in analytic systems and can be  powerful in showing a student where they stand in relation to  others in the class [19] but can also have several potential  negative consequences [46]. Thus how the reference frame of  other students is positioned in an important element of  pedagogical intervention design. Specifically the performance of  others students can be useful as a motivating factor for low- performing students who may not initially realize how their  efforts stack up against others; however this frame of reference  can also lead to competitive behavior or be stressful and  intimidating for some students. There is also a tendency for  aggregated class statistics such as course averages to become  targets for students, which may or may not be appropriate  depending on the activity profile of the class. For example, at the  beginning of a course when students are just figuring out the  system the analytic patterns displayed may not be ideal or  realistic targets to aim for. In addition, measures of the classs  central tendency (particularly the average) may be overly  influenced by the activity, or inactivity, of certain students. For  example, recent work looking at student activity in massive open  online courses showed that a substantial portion (40-80%) of the  population who enrolled in the courses studied did so simply to  sample the course [25]; in this case measures of central   tendency would provide a false reference point at which to target  ones activity.   Some of the issues described above can be addressed through  careful design and refinement of analytic tools; for example  processing data to provide aggregate measures for only similar  kinds of students or providing aggregate measures of variance as  well as central tendency. However, there is also an important role  for intervention design to play in terms of helping students to  prioritize the reference points of self, peers and activity goals as  well as understanding the value and limitations of the peer  reference points provided in a specific context. This information  can be provided up front as part of the initial goal-setting process,  during the course of the learning activity, or as needed through  individual dialogue as described below. For example, the Student  Activity Meter is a learning analytics system that provides learners  with line charts, bar graphs, and parallel coordinate visualizations  showing how they compare to their peers in terms of metrics such  as time spent working, intensity of work sessions, and number of  resources used [19]. This toolset inherently encourages use of the  peer reference frame in interpreting the data, though the line chart  also allow learners to see changes in their individual working  patterns over time.   To support productive comparative activity while guarding  against a detrimental competitive mentality, a pedagogical  intervention for this analytic tool could take several different  forms. In some courses external standards for expected activity  can be given. For example, if it is known that there is a minimum  number of resources that generally need to be consulted to be  successful on a project, this figure can be highlighted to students  from the start as an fixed guidepost by which to judge progress.  Similarly, if the instructor knows that students tend to be more  productive when they engage in a smaller number of intensive  work periods (rather than many brief ones), then they can be  encouraged to work towards a line chart pattern that includes  periods of steep rise, rather than one that is simply higher overall.  In cases where absolute indicators are harder to provide, a  pedagogical intervention might focus on the personal reference  frame, explicitly asking students to keep track of and set goals for  their individual progress, or their progress with respect to the  group. Another approach might focus on collective efforts,  encouraging the class to use the analytics as a group diagnostic to  help each other keep advancing together. An important aim in  each of these intervention designs is to help students avoid the  simplistic mentality of more (than other students) is better.  While knowing where one stands in relation to ones peers is  important and useful, in some cases more than others may still not  be enough (generally or for that particular student), while in other  cases everyone may already be well beyond the bar of what is  necessary, making additional exertion to improve a particular  metric wasted effort. If all students are always trying to surpass  all other, it may even create an unintentional ratcheting effect.   3.4 Principle 4: Dialogue   An important issue in implementing learning analytics relate to  questions of power and access to analytics [15]. The concerns  related to these issues can be addressed to some extent through  the principle of Dialogue; that is creating a space of negotiation  around the interpretation of the analytics in which data serves as a  reflective and dialogic tool between the instructor and students  rather than one in which the instructor collects data on the  students. This serves as a complement to the principle of Agency  in which students are empowered to set goals for and reflect on   208    their own analytics and also provides support for students in  engaging in this process.  As mentioned above, many online journaling tools such as wikis  and blogs support interactivity between individuals, thus a  dedicated space set up for reflection can easily be made a shared  space between student and instructor, or even between groups of  students. For example, EnquiryBlogger discussed earlier as an  example of a purposefully created reflective space, provides  functionality for instructors (and other students) to access and  comment on the blog entries and to search for ones tagged with  specific learning dispositions [18].  There are several advantages to making the reflection process  dialogic. First, a shared journal creates an audience for the writing  and gives the student the opportunity for their voice to be heard.  Specifically, students may be able to bring information to bear in  interpreting their analytics that the instructor would not be aware  of on their own (e.g. I had a really difficult time with this part of  the assignment, I tried extra hard this week, I know I need to  share my ideas more, but I dont always feel confident that I have  the right idea). Second, it gives the instructor (or a designate) the  opportunity to examine students goal-setting and analytics  interpretations and respond as necessary to address any  confusions, repair questionable interpretations, or realign goals.  Finally, in some cases students may identify goals based on their  analytics but not know how to make progress on them, thus a  dialogic space gives them the opportunity to ask for help and the  instructor the chance to provide suggestions or strategies. In these  ways interactive journal writing actively facilitates the process of  reflection [1] as well as provide a checkpoint to make sure that  students are on productive paths in their self-regulation. In  addition, the analytics themselves provide a support for dialogue  by acting as a third voice in the conversation. This gives the  instructor a neutral object to which they can usefully refer in  conversation (e.g. did you notice how your level of participation  compares to the rest of the class rather than you need to  participate more).  The major challenge in enacting the principle of dialogue is the  issue of scale. In a small class it is possible for the instructor to  interact with all students on a relatively frequent basis, but as the  student to instructor ratio rises this become progressively more  difficult, and in the case of massive open online courses it is  simply not possible. Two possible alternatives for fostering  dialogue around analytics may be plausible, however. First, a  tiered system could be employed where teaching assistants or  student leaders serve as the primary dialogue partner, with  questions or concerns elevated to the instructor as needed.  Second, in some situations it may be viable for students to support  each other through partnership or triad models. The concern here  comes from a lack of experience on the part of the students and  the ability to effectively support each other, thus this approach  may work best with learners who are relatively proficient in using  analytics to the support their learning.   4. CONCLUSIONS   This paper has made the case for the importance of pedagogical  intervention design for student use of learning analytics and  situated it within the larger landscape of the field. Four principles  (Integration, Agency, Reference Frame and Dialogue) and three  processes (Grounding, Goal-Setting and Reflection) for the design  of pedagogical learning analytics interventions were introduced as  tools for helping to support the productive use of learning   analytics by students. As may be clear by now, the issues related  to each of these principles are not independent, and in fact are  quite tightly entwined. For example the process of reflection ties  back to goals, makes use of a reference frame and is shared with  the instructor as part of a dialogue, while integration to some  extent serves as a meta-organizing principle that encapsulates all  others. To represent these relationships, I present a preliminary  model integrating the elements of pedagogical learning analytics  intervention design for students in Figure 1. This model is offered  not as an end point, but as a starting place to stimulate attention to  learning analytics intervention design. Empirical work is needed  to apply, test, validate, refine and revise this model and develop  our understanding of other factors that can support the productive  use of learning analytics by students. As discussed above, in my  own research group we have already collected data from a  learning analytics intervention for online discussions developed in  consultation with the model. The data is currently being analyzed  to provide initial empirical validation and further inform our  understanding of the principles and processes involved. Further  application of the pedagogical intervention design model in other  kinds of educational contexts with different learning analytics  applications and populations of learners is needed to establish its  more general utility and identify the additional considerations  needed to usefully apply and adapt it across a variety of learning  analytic contexts.   To conclude, this paper has taken an initial step towards the  intentional and principled design of learning analytics  interventions for students. Such attention to pedagogical  intervention design is a critical complement to technical  developments in order for the field of learning analytics to truly  make an impact on the ways in which we teach and learn.        5.

INTRODUCTION Learning analytics (LA) is understood in this paper to  be measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of under- standing and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs [15]. This field is undergoing a rapid ex- pansion and a diverse range of approaches have started to emerge [8, 17, 14]. Implementation of LA ranges from basic aggregation of existing data [12], through to course restruc- turing to work with a specific approach [6]. While using LA simply as a dashboard to report upon student grades and trace contributing factors is relatively easy to implement, it can add little additional value to learning beyond quan- titative feedback. In contrast, a LA based restructuring of courses can be highly disruptive to existing teaching and  Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for per- sonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

So both of these approaches risk alienation of the key stakeholders in the learning process, and poten- tially result in a rejection of the system by those that it was intended to support.  Kruse and Pongsajapan [10] have noted that LA is often focussed on identifying those students that are poised to fail, rather than providing benefits for all students. Camp- bell [4] extends this criticism, claiming that profiling (or placing students in generalised categories) is a common use for analytics, and importantly questions whether this is ap- propriate.  Despite the best of intentions, latent issues frequently arise in implementations of LA, particularly where metrics are used for judgements about learning. Shum et. al. [13] stated that a marker of the health of the learning analytics field will be the quality of debate around what the tech- nology renders visible and leaves invisible, and the peda- gogical implications of design decisions, whether the design rationale is explicit or implicit. Dietz-Uhler and Hurn [5] question the frequent unintended assumption that metrics extracted from Learning Management Systems (LMS) are a proxy for learning. Beer et. al. [2] identify issues with bringing a managerial mindset to LA: assumptions embod- ied by managerialism may be an inappropriate foundation for the application of learning analytics into tertiary learn- ing environments. Assessment and policy theorists warn that the use of learning data has significant implications as a technology of governance and control [11]. Even more con- cerning are the implications of Campbells law, which points out that the more that any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures, and the more likely it will be to distort the social processes it is intended to monitor [16].  Bach [1] identified the main limitation of deploying learn- ing analytics as the reliability and validity of the learning outcomes and learner characteristic data used in the mod- els. Hidden problems with validity of data can become more significant, when an LA implementation doesnt take into account the wide and varied needs of those using the system.  For the benefit of learning, and for improving the effec- tiveness of LA, the design of LA systems needs to address these concerns. In particular, LA needs to work in favour of quality information for the improvement in learning out- comes, rather than solely for an increase in the quantity of the information.  212    2. THE COPA FRAMEWORK We have addressed some of these issues through the devel-  opment of COPA, the Cognitive OPeration framework for Analytics. COPA is a theoretical framework that is drawn from the cognitive processing dimension of Blooms Revised Taxonomy [9], a respected educational taxonomy which was developed for the purpose of stating curriculum objectives in terms of levels of learner cognition [3]. This taxonomy provides a widely respected and pedagogically sound foun- dation for our framework, however our approach could allow for other taxonomies to be used instead.  In developing the framework, our focus was on captur- ing data that represents the level of cognitive processing required by a learning activity. Levels of cognitive pro- cessing can be represented as verbs, or cognitive actions, which range from those articulated in broad curriculum ob- jectives through to their use in more specific learning activi- ties. There are 6 levels in Blooms Revised Taxonomy which are represented as the verbs: remember, understand, apply, analyse, evaluate, and create. It was not our intention for the framework to capture other aspects of the learning pro- cess such as the knowledge itself, content complexity, non- cognitive behaviours, and artefacts resulting from learning activities.  Fundamentally, COPA provides a consistent approach for mapping course objectives, learning activities, and assess- ment items, to the 6 levels represented by these verbs. This provides a flexible structure linking objectives to the cog- nitive demand expected of the learner. The verbs that are mapped, can then be exposed to the Learning Analytics sys- tem via a computational mechanism such as xAPI [7].  COPA was designed to be applied to at least 2 educa- tional contexts, to the curriculum, and to learning activities (including assessment). When applied to the curriculum, COPA can provide insight on the various levels of cognitive demand required by a range of objectives. It can enable an evaluation of the degree of consistency across the cur- riculum, as well as assist with the identification of potential issues in curriculum structure. In this context, COPA can also provide a mechanism to assess the extent to which learn- ers are engaging cognitively at the levels necessary for the curriculum to be effective.  When applied to learning activities, and the extent to which a learner successfully completes them, the framework can provide an indication of the learners level of cognitive operation. We have assumed a degree of competence in cur- riculum implementation, and that therefore, a learners suc- cessful participation in components of a course, is evidence of operation at the mapped cognitive level. In this context, COPA can also indicate the extent to which high levels of cognition are expected over time, and the ability to com- pare differing tasks based on the level of cognitive demand. It can be used to provide highly personalised information to the learner about the extent to which they are engaging cognitively with certain tasks.  Because Blooms Taxonomy was originally created to as- sist with the uniform specification of educational objectives, the accepted application has been to break each of the six levels into subcategories of verbs. See table 1 for an exam- ple of how subcategory verbs may be grouped in levels. In the revision of the taxonomy, Krathwohl [9] made explicit the idea that there is some overlap between each of the six levels. It is not expected that verbs only belong to one cat-  egory, as sometimes the sense of how the verb is used may be necessary to ascertain the level for the objective being classified. Similarly for COPA, there is not a rigid require- ment that verbs belong to specific categories. However, for automated classification, ambiguous verbs may need to be avoided. It is also important to note with respect to lev- els of cognition, that the learner doesnt cease to operate at one level when operating at another. Necessarily, there will always be cognitive demand for remembering as well as creating in a course of learning.  Table 1: Blooms category verbs with example sub- category verbs  Category verbs Subcategory verbs Creating Designing, Synthesising, Innovating  Evaluating Assessing, Critiquing, Discerning Analysing Comparing, Classifying, Investigating Applying Calculating, Solving, Demonstrating  Understanding Interpreting, Summarising, Explaining Remembering Recognising, Recalling, Collecting  3. USING COPA A basic application of COPA to a course of study requires  a minimum of 2 steps. Firstly, a mapping process extracts verbs in curriculum documents and associates these verbs with the six levels of the taxonomy. Secondly, the result of the first step is used to filter results of the implementation of the curriculum, which maps results of learning activities back to the six levels. The extent to which each of these levels feature, is recorded into the LA system.  For example, take a course objective that states that stu- dents should be able to critique a paper, and a correspond- ing assessment item that requires that students interpret, compare and classify papers as part of the critque writing process. If the results for a particular student show that they did reasonably interpret, compare and classify, but did not perform particularly well with the critique, then based on our example mappings in table 1, this student for this activity might score well in Analyse and not so well in Eval- uate. When taking the aggregate information for all stu- dents taking the course, it would be possible to see, in terms of cognitive operation, the extent to which an entire class achieves the set learning objectives. Thus, continuing with the example above, if a number of students exhibited the same pattern of behaviour, and evaluation was the set learn- ing objective, then the course could be seen to be failing to achieve its desired outcomes.  Different courses and activities may use different subcate- gory verbs in their descriptions, however because these sub- category verbs are mapped to the higher level 6 verbs of the taxonomy (which do not change), many different cur- ricular specifications and activities can be compared at the same cognitive processing level. It is this consistency across diverse elements, that allows COPA to be a powerful con- tributor to learning analytics.  Another application of COPA allows for the analysis of curriculum design. This application involves mapping both high level strategy documents and low level activity docu- ments in terms of their cognitive demand. The 2 different types of documents can then be analysed in terms of their consistency. For example, if faculty curriculum documents  213    required all students of the faculty to be Evaluating and Cre- ating (indicated by subcategory verbs associated with these levels), but the activity documents designed by faculty staff rarely required Evaluating and Creating, then there would be a mismatch between the cognitive operation expected for individual learning activities compared with the higher level faculty expectations.  This application can be most useful in curriculum design, which is highlighted in the following section, and can also assist with the identification of units of study that are not performing (from a cognitive demand perspective) to the standard expected by the faculty. It can provide a way of using LA to identify whether the action matches the rhetoric with respect to cognitive demand.  Finally, COPA also provides for some degree of predic- tion. Correlating trends of cognitive processing levels for an individual with learned norms, and associating the resultant data with other analytics such as level of activity, atten- dance, and engagement, could provide rich possibilities for prediction of future levels of success.  4. EXAMPLE APPLICATION As a proof of concept, we applied COPA to Science in  Context (SEB101), an introductory unit in a Bachelor of Science Degree course run at QUT for the first time in 2013. The particular unit that we analysed, was part of a complete redesign of QUTs Bachelor of Science degree to fall into line with the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). The AQF is a policy that provides a national unification of all ed- ucation and training qualifications in Australia. Thus, the analysis that follows is specific to the Australian context. However, we anticipate that it can be applied to other ter- tiary systems by identifying the corresponding pedagogical instruments and assessment maps.  SEB101 is a unit that lays the foundation for an under- standing of the theory and practice of science within its broader social, economic and political contexts. However, students spent a large amount of time performing tasks that were explicitly skills based such as writing and oral presen- tations. This disconnect between the purpose of the overall unit, and the skills based methodology, created a very real tension between the high level Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) specified in the AQF, and the more specific learn- ing activities and assessments implemented in class. This made this unit an interesting case study, as we were able to use COPA as a tool to identify discrepancies between the intended purpose of the course and what was actually cov- ered. Any mis-matches can be used in future development of the unit so that it is more aligned with its intended CLOs.  For the purpose of this exercise, we utilised both the AQF based CLOs as they are represented in QUTs internal design documentation, and a Unit Guide that was made available to the students in week one of the unit. The Unit Guide provided students with all information relevant to the unit, including assessment tasks and the grading criteria that were to be used in assessing them. Both documents have been made available online for interested readers to refer to at: http://www.users.on.net/kirsty.kitto/assessment.html  Following the COPA approach, we first identified verbs in the faculty course overview documentation (which is based on the AQF), as well as verbs in the unit guide objectives (not including specific assessment task objectives). We then mapped these verbs to the corresponding levels in the tax-  onomy, which provided us with information on the cognitive demand required for the course as a whole. An example of how subcategory verbs were mapped to Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) can be seen in Table 2.  Table 2: Course Learning Outcomes were mapped to subcategory verbs for each level  Level Verb CLO Creating Synthesising CLO4 Evaluating Evaluating, Judging,  Deducing, Conclud- ing, Discerning, Re- lating  CL03, CL04, CLO5, CLO6  Analysing Analysing, Interpret- ing, Investigating  CLO3  Applying Applying, Solving, Demonstrating  CLO2, CL07  Understanding Understanding, Ex- plaining, Communi- cating, Empathising  CL01, CLO5  Remembering Knowing, Articu- lating, Collecting, Gathering, Record- ing  CL01, CLO3  Secondly, we used COPA to analyse the objectives for the three assessment tasks and the associated criteria from the task marking rubrics, both specified in the Unit Guide. The assessment tasks included a written critique (30%), a group based oral presentation (30%), and a portfolio of smaller work tasks (40%). The portfolio included marks for complet- ing tasks during workshops, an interview with a scientist, an evaluation of three guest speakers, and an essay about the philosophy of science. The analysis of these activities pro- vided us with information on the levels of cognitive operation that were required by the students to complete the learning activities and assessment tasks. Table 3 is an example of how sub category verbs were mapped with assessment tasks for one of the levels (Creating).  Table 3: Example of mapping subcategory verbs to assessment tasks for creating level  Level Verb Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Creating creating 1 1  synthesising 4 1 1 integrating 1 1 imagining 1 1  hypothesising 1 compelling 1  For each document analysed, we extracted the sub cate- gory verbs and assigned each one to a level in COPA. Most verbs were explicitly stated in the relevant text, but for a few the relevant verb was inferred. Some verbs could be treated at a number of different levels in the taxonomy, but the context in which the verb was used was generally ca- pable of resolving this issue. The analysis was based on a simple frequency count of how many times a particular level was addressed by the document under consideration. While such a frequency count initially sounds too simple to be particularly useful, the discussion that follows will show  214    that such an assumption is misguided. We took the frequency count data and expressed it as a  percentage of the overall verb count for both course doc- umentation and assessment documentation, which provided us with an SEB101 signature for each document set. Table 4 shows the extent to which these signatures correlate.  We would expect that high level objectives of a course would match reasonably well with the assessment items of a course in terms of the cognitive demand placed on students. However, we found that in this instance, that was not the case. This was a disturbing outcome, since it implied that the AQF level CLOs were not clearly followed within the im- plementation of this unit (as represented in the Unit guide, and in the assessment tasks).  Table 4: A Comparison of course and assessment signatures  Level Course (percent) Assessment (percent) Creating 4.2 20.3  Evaluating 33.3 11.6 Analysing 12.5 16.0 Applying 12.5 18.8  Understanding 16.7 18.8 Remembering 20.8 14.5  The application of COPA in this example, allowed us to identify potential issues in the implementation of SEB101 that can be addressed in the future. If a Learning Analytics system was using COPA for the student results of this unit, we would have also been able to analyse student cognitive processing and compared it to what was expected by the course documentation. This presents opportunity for future research on using COPA for LA.  Although this relatively simple application of COPA to SEB101 proved fruitful from a curriculum design perspec- tive, we anticipate that the application of COPA can inform more than just curriculum design. For example, it would not be difficult to extend the framework across all units that a student is undertaking, and to then perform an additional mapping that was not performed here: a mapping of the assessment results that the student obtains. If a student consistently performed poorly on tasks revolving around, for example, analysing, then this could be shown to them as a graph of expected vs obtained analytical capability. Thus, COPA could identify weaknesses in a students cognitive de- velopment, that the student could then attempt to redress in a conscious manner. In a truly tailored online offering such weaknesses could be incorporated into suggestions as to what tasks or further studies might help the student to round out their cognitive development. Thus, an assess- ment task that was high on the students weak spot could be identified or flagged for the student as one that might help them to improve in this area.  On a more pragmatic level, it is important to realise that verb usage in objectives incorporates assumptions about the nature of the tasks that the learner will undertake and the extent to which they accomplish them. Any implementation of COPA should ensure that there is clarity around these assumptions, in order that the application of the framework is consistent, and the resultant analytics are an accurate reflection of reality.  5. BENEFITS COPA offers a number of benefits, both at a pedagogical  level, and in its design led data capture and reporting. Ar- guably, the primary benefit of COPA is that it is grounded in solid educational theory. COPA ensures that the LA data is viewed through a lens that has persisted in educational curriculum and assessment design for more than more than 50 years, and that there are generally accepted ways of un- derstanding the resultant data. While there is still room for poor judgement in the implementation of COPA, the ed- ucationally based approach with a central focus of learner cognition makes these poor judgements less likely.  A second related benefit of COPA is its focus on the depth of learning that the student is engaged in. While assessment grades provide LA with a quantity of success and failure over a number of tasks, this data does not usually store the depth of learning associated with those tasks. As such its possible for students to be highly successful in many tasks that never require a higher level of cognition than applying. COPA, on the other hand provides data on the extent to which a student is required to operate at a particular level in the successful execution of set tasks.  Many LA implementations co-occur with curriculum de- sign. A significant advantage of COPA is that when incor- porated at the design stage, data capture can be automated. If the mapping of verbs is completed with the design, then the appropriate learning records can be pre-designed and in- stances generated as the learner participates in or completes activities. For example an analyse verb is associated with a written assessment task in design. The LA system stores this associate between the task and the verb, and when the learner successfully completes the task, a learning record is posted to the learning record store with the learners name, the verb and the task. Given that the objectives containing the verbs will need to be articulated at the design stage any- way, there is nothing more to be done when implementing COPA than to ensure that the system stores the relationship between the task and the verb contained in the objective.  A fourth benefit of COPA is that it doesnt require an all or nothing approach. Partial implementation is possible, or it can be added on to existing curriculum without change to the curriculum itself.  Finally, another of the significant advantages of COPA is that it doesnt need to be explicit in the learning activities for it to work. For example, a problem solving activity may involve searching for academic papers with certain topics being required, but deliberately omitted from the task de- scription. The expectation being that higher cognitive levels are required to find papers relevant to these unstated top- ics. The search behaviour of each student can be captured, and topics that are explicitly mentioned in the task descrip- tion can be mapped to lower levels, whereas highly relevant topics that are not explicitly mentioned, can be mapped to higher levels. In this situation, the topic search history of the learner gives an indication of how they were thinking about the problem.  6. LIMITATIONS There are potential limitations of COPA. We have iden-  tified two as follows. Firstly, COPA is reliant on other ana- lytics data to make the analytics about cognitive processing meaningful. For example, it is insufficient to know that a  215    learner has created without knowing what that learner has created and how that relates to other creations. So while we dont apologise for focusing purely on cognitive processing with COPA, we also recognise the importance of its inter- dependence on other aspects of learning.  Secondly, COPA assumes an interest in learner cognition beyond what may be inferred by assessment grades. The value of COPA is related to the desire to obtain richer in- formation about cognitive demand and the extent to which the learner meets that demand. There is little value in im- plementing COPA if student grades is all that is required to meet the needs of the stakeholders.  7. CONCLUSION In this paper we have attempted to provide a basis for a  learning analytics framework which we have called COPA, that is based on levels of cognitive processing. We have found the cognitive processing dimension of Blooms revised taxonomy to be effective in allowing us to map verbs from learning documents to levels of cognitive operation. With the recent availability of the xAPI, we anticipate that COPA will provide a useful addition to learning analytics, and to that end we have described the process of applying COPA to a first year science unit as part of a Bachelor of Science degree course. Our early findings in working this implemen- tation have provided valuable feedback to the teaching team for that unit, and indicate great potential in course design. Furthermore, we have identified a possibility for reporting these levels of cognitive processing back to a student under- taking a course of study, which could allow for needs based targeted learning activities and assessment task offerings.  We believe that our new framework, COPA, offers signifi- cant benefits for a curriculum design led automated capture of data in a LA system. It provides a way to straddle the all too often seen gap that arises between data that is easy to capture but not particularly beneficial to the student, and data that is highly useful to the student as they attempt to become a better learner, but has so far only been gathered via explicit means (e.g. surveys) that are not specific to the context in which the student is currently embedded. Thus, in paying close attention to respected educational pedagog- ical principles, we have found a way in which LA could be- come a powerful tool to enhance students ongoing cognitive development.  8.

Unlike face-to-  face talk, students on asynchronous, online forums can  participate at different places and times and have more time to  gather information, contemplate ideas, and evaluate claims  before responding, resulting in superior decision-making,  problem solving, writing and knowledge creation  (KC,  [35][42][19]). The nascent field of learning analytics seeks to  understand and optimize learning and the online learning  environment in which it occurs [1]. Using online forum data,  studies using aggregate counts show how specific actions (e.g.,  why or how questions, explanations, evidence, summaries)  are related to KC [31][32][45].     While aggregate counts provide descriptive summaries, they do  not fully utilize the information relating to the time and order of  collaboration and learning processes [39], or capture the  sequential data needed to test KC hypotheses about how group  members actions/posts/messages are related to one another  [12].     In contrast, discourse-centric learning analytics go beyond  surface measures to investigate the quality of the learning  process, specifically the rhetorical dimensions, to improve  discourse for deeper learning and learning design [17].  In a  similar vein, analyses of sequences of messages can illuminate  the relationships among processes that contribute to knowledge  creation by testing whether some types of messages (e.g., asking  for an explanation) or sequences of messages (different opinion  followed by asking for explanation) often precede types of  target messages (e.g., theorizing). These results can help us  understand the temporal and causal relationships among  different types of messages or message sequences that aid or  hinder knowledge creation. We show how statistical discourse  analysis (SDA, [13]) can model these sequences to test these KC  hypotheses.  To explicate SDA, we introduce data [18] and  hypotheses to contextualize the methodological issues.    Specifically, we test whether three types of cognition (informal  opinion, elaboration and evidence) and three types of social  metacognition (ask for explanation, ask about use and different  opinion) increase the likelihoods of new information or  theoretical explanations in subsequent messages. This example  shows how SDA might be fruitfully applied to large datasets  (e.g., massive online open courses, MOOCs) as a vital learning  analytics tool.  2. DATA  In this study, we examine asynchronous, online forum messages  written by students in a 13-week online graduate educational  technology course delivered using Web-Knowledge Forum  (KF).  These data are the second iteration of a larger design-  217    based research study [18]. Data sources included questionnaire  responses, learning journals, and discourse in KF. One of the  authors participated in the course both as a design researcher  collaborating closely with the instructor and as a teaching  assistant interacting in course discussions with students. The  goals for this study were twofold: to improve the quality of  online graduate education in this particular instance, and to  contribute to the theoretical understanding of how students  collaborate to learn deeply and create knowledge through  progressive discourse [3][4].         2.1 Participants  Participants were 17 students (12 females, 5 males) (see Table  4). They ranged in age from mid-20s to mid-40s. Five were  students in academic programs (4 M.A., 1 Ph.D.); 12 were  students in professional programs (9 M.Ed., 3 Ed.D.).      2.2 Procedure   Students were encouraged to engage in progressive discourse  through three interventions : a reading by Bereiter [4], classroom  materials called Discourse for Inquiry (DFI) cards, and the  scaffold supports feature built into KF. The DFI cards were  adapted from classroom materials originally developed by  Woodruff and Brett [46] to help elementary school teachers and  preservice teachers improve their face-to-face collaborative  discussion. The DFI cards model thinking processes and  discourse structures to help online graduate students engage in  progressive discourse in KF. There were three DFI cards:  Managing Problem Solving outlined commitments to  progressive discourse [4]; Managing Group Discourse  suggested guidelines for supporting or opposing a view; and  Managing Meetings provided two strategies to help students  deal with anxiety. The cards were in a portable document file  (.pdf) that students could download, print out, or see as they  worked online.     KF, an extension of the CSILE (Computer Supported Intentional  Learning Environment), is specially designed to support  knowledge building. Students work in virtual spaces to develop  their ideas, represented as notes, which we will refer to in this  paper as messages (see Figure 1).           Figure 1. KF view showing thread structure of messages.    KF offers sophisticated features conducive to learning analytics  that are not available in other conferencing technologies,   including scaffold supports (labels of thinking types), rise- above (a higher-level integrative note, such as a summary or  synthesis of facts into a theory), and a capacity to connect ideas  through links between messages in different views (see Figure  2).            Figure 2. KF Message with scaffold supports, link,  annotation, and other information.    Students select a scaffold support and typically use it as a  sentence opener while composing messages; hence, they self- code their messages by placing yellow highlights of thinking  types in the text that bracket segments of body text in the  messages    At the beginning of the course, only the Theory Building and  Opinion scaffolds built into KF were available. Later, in week 9,  two students designed the Idea Improvement scaffolds (e.g.,  What do we need this idea for) as part of their discussion  leadership (see Table 1). The Idea Improvement scaffolds were  intended by the student designers of the scaffolds to emphasize  the socio-cognitive dynamics of improvable ideas, one of the  twelve knowledge building principles [40] for progressive  discourse. In this study, we focus our analysis on tracing  messages with scaffold supports that build on or reply to one  another. Types of scaffold supports relevant to our hypotheses  are organized and renamed (italicized) in terms of cognition,  social metacognition, and dependent variables.  218        Table 1.

It might depend  on the people.)         3. HYPOTHESIS  We test whether recent cognition or social metacognition  facilitate new information or theoretical explanations [10][34].   Introducing new information and creating theoretical  explanations are both key processes that contribute to  knowledge building discourse.  New information provides grist  that theoretical explanations can integrate during discourse to  yield knowledge creation.  As students propose integrative  theories that explain more facts, they create knowledge through  a process of explanatory coherence [43]. Hence, new  information and theoretical explanations are suitable target  processes to serve as dependent variables in our statistical model.    Researchers have shown that many online discussions begin  with sharing of opinions [23]. Students often activate familiar,  informal concepts before less familiar, formal concepts [9].  During a discussion, comments by one student (e.g., a key word)  might spark another student to activate related concepts in his or  her semantic network and propose a new idea [37].  When  students do not clearly understand these ideas, they can ask  questions to elicit new information, elaborations or explanations  [25]. Also, students may disagree (different opinions) and  address their differences by introducing evidence or explaining  their ideas [27]. Whereas individual metacognition is monitoring  and regulating ones own knowledge, emotions, and actions  [24], social metacognition is defined as group members  monitoring and controlling one anothers knowledge, emotions,  and actions [16]. Specifically, we test whether three types of  cognition (informal opinion, elaboration and evidence) and three  types of social metacognition (ask for explanation, ask about use  and different opinion) increase the likelihoods of new   information or theoretical explanations in subsequent messages.  See Table 2. To reduce omitted variable bias, additional  individual and time explanatory variables were added. For  example, earlier studies showed that males were more likely  than females to make claims, argue, elaborate, explain, and  critique others [34].      Table 2.

ANALYSIS  To test the above hypotheses, we must address analytic  difficulties involving the data, the dependent variables and the  explanatory variables (see Table 3). Data issues include missing  data, nested data and the tree structure of online messages.  Difficulties involving dependent variables include discrete  outcomes, infrequent outcomes, similar adjacent messages and  multiple outcomes. Explanatory variable issues include  sequences, indirect effects, false positives and robustness of  results. SDA addresses each of these analytic difficulties, as  described below.    SDA addresses the data issues (missing data, nested data, and  tree structure of online messages) with Markov Chain Monte  Carlo multiple imputation (MCMC-MI), multilevel analysis, and  identification of the previous message. Missing data (due to  uncoded messages, computer problems, etc.) can reduce  estimation efficiency, complicate data analyses, and bias results.   By estimating the missing data, MCMC-MI addresses this issue  more effectively than deletion, mean substitution, or simple  imputation, according to computer simulations [38].        Table 3.

To address this issue,  SDA models nested data with a multilevel analysis [20][6].    Unlike a linear, face-to-face conversation in which one turn of  talk always follows the one before it, an asynchronous message  in an online forum might follow a message written much earlier.   Still, each message in a topic folder and its replies are linked to  one another by multiple threads and single connections in a tree  structure. See Figure 3 for an example of a topic message (1)  and its 8 responses (2, 3, ... 9).     Figure 3. Tree structure showing how nine messages are   related to one another.    These nine messages occur along three discussion threads: (a) 1   2 ( 3;  7), (b) 1  4 ( 6;   8  9) and (c) 1 5.  Messages in each thread are ordered by time, but they are not  necessarily consecutive. In thread (b) for example, message #6  followed message #4 (not #5). To capture the tree structure of  the messages, we identify the immediate predecessor of each  message. Then, we can reconstruct the written reply structure of  the entire tree to identify any ordinal predecessor of any  message. Patterns of reading behavior may be irregular across  threads and are thus more difficult to trace.     SDA addresses the dependent variable difficulties (discrete,  infrequent, serial correlation and multiple) with Logit  regressions, a Logit bias estimator, I2 index of Q-statistics, and  multivariate outcome analyses. The dependent variables are  often discrete (a justification occurs in a conversation or it does  not) rather than continuous (e.g., test scores), so standard  regressions such as ordinary least squares can bias the standard   errors. To model discrete dependent variables, we use a Logit  regression [29]. As infrequent dependent variables can bias the  results of a Logit regression [30], we estimate the Logit bias and  remove it [30].    As adjacent messages are often more closely related to one  another more than messages that are far apart, failure to model  this similarity (serial correlation of errors) can bias the results  [29]. An I2 index of Q-statistics tested all topics simultaneously  for serial correlation of residuals in adjacent messages [28]. If  the I2 index shows significant serial correlation, adding the  dependent variable of the previous message as an explanatory  variable often eliminates the serial correlation (e.g., when  modeling the outcome variable theory, add whether it occurs in  the previous message [theory (1)] [15]; see paragraph below on  vector auto-regression.    Multiple outcomes (new information, theorizing) can have  correlated residuals that can underestimate standard errors [20].  If the outcomes are from different levels, separate analyses must  be done at each level, as analyzing them in the same model  over-counts the sample size of the higher level outcome(s) and  biases standard errors. To model multiple outcomes properly at  the same level of analysis, we use a multivariate outcome,  multilevel analysis, which models the correlation between the  outcomes (new information, theorizing) and removes the  correlation between residuals [20].    Furthermore, SDA addresses the explanatory variable issues  (sequences, indirect effects, false positives, robustness) with  vector auto-regression, multilevel M-tests, the two-stage linear  step-up procedure, and robustness tests. A vector auto- regression (VAR, [29]) combines attributes of sequences of  recent messages into a local context (micro-sequence context) to  model how they influence the subsequent messages. For  example, the likelihood of New Information in a message might  be influenced by attributes of earlier messages (e.g., Different  Opinion in the previous message) or earlier authors (e.g., gender  of the author of the previous message).     Multiple explanatory variables can yield indirect, mediation  effects or false positives. As single-level mediation tests on  nested data can bias results downward, multi-level M-tests are  used for multilevel data in this case, messages within topics  [36]. Testing many hypotheses of potential explanatory variables  also increases the likelihood of a false positive (Type I error). To  control for the false discovery rate (FDR), the two-stage linear  step-up procedure was used, as it outperformed 13 other  methods in computer simulations [2].    To test the robustness of the results, three variations of the core  model can be used. First, a single outcome, multilevel model can  be run for each dependent variable. Second, subsets of the data  (e.g., halves) can be run separately to test the consistency of the  results for each subset. Third, the analyses can be repeated for  the original data set (without the estimated data).    4.1 Analysis Procedure  After MCMC-MI of the missing data (less than 1%) to yield a  complete data set, each online messages preceding message  was identified and stored to capture the tree structure of the  messages. Then, we simultaneously modeled two process  variables in students messages (New Information and  Theorizing) with SDA [11].     Processymt = y + eymt + fyt            (1)      220    For Processymt (the process variable y [e.g., new information] for  message m in topic t), y is the grand mean intercept (see  Equation 1). The message- and topic-level residuals are emt and  ft respectively. As analyzing rare events (target processes  occurred in less than 10% of all messages) with Logit/Probit  regressions can bias regression coefficient estimates, King and  Zengs [30] bias estimator was used to adjust them.    First, a vector of student demographic variables was entered:  male and young (Demographics; see Equation 2). Each set of  predictors was tested for significance with a nested hypothesis  test (2 log likelihood, [29]).     Processymt = y + eymt +fyt + ydtDemographicsymt    + ystSchoolingymt + yjtJobymt   + yxtExperienceymt + yptPreviousymt   (2)     Next, schooling variables were entered: doctoral student,  Masters of Education student, Masters of Arts student, and part- time student (Schooling).  Then, students job variables were  entered: teacher, post-secondary teacher, and technology (Job).   Next, students experience variables were entered: KF  experience and number of past online courses (Experience).    Then, attributes of the previous message were entered: opinion  (-1), elaboration (-1), anecdote (-1), ask about use (-1), ask for  explanation (-1), different opinion (-1), new information (-1),  theory (-1) and any of these processes (-1) (Previous).  The  attributes of the message two responses ago along the same  thread (-2) were entered, then, those of the message three  responses ago along the same thread (-3), and so on until none  of the attributes in a message were statistically significant.     Structural variables (Demographics, Schooling, Job,  Experience) might show moderation effects, so a random  effects model was used. If the regression coefficients of an  explanatory variable in the Previous message (e.g., evidence;  ypt = yt + fyj) differed significantly (fyj  0), then a moderation  effect might exist, and their interactions with processes were  included.      The multilevel M-test [36] identified multilevel mediation  effects (within and across levels).  For significant mediators, the  percentage change is 1  (b'/b), where b and b are the regression  coefficients of the explanatory variable, with and without the  mediator in the model, respectively. The odds ratio of each  variables total effect (TE = direct effect plus indirect effect)  was reported as the increase or decrease (+TE% or TE%) in the  outcome variable [29].  As percent increase is not linearly  related to standard deviation, scaling is not warranted.     An alpha level of .05 was used. To control for the false  discovery rate, the two-stage linear step-up procedure was used  [2]. An I2 index of Q-statistics tested messages across all topics  simultaneously for serial correlation, which was modeled if  needed [21][28][33].    4.1.1 Conditions of Use.   SDA relies on two primary assumptions and requires a  minimum sample size. Like other regressions, SDA assumes a  linear combination of explanatory variables (Nonlinear aspects  can be modeled as nonlinear functions of variables [e.g., age2] or  interactions among variables [anecdote x ask about use].) SDA  also requires independent residuals (no serial correlation as  discussed above). In addition, SDA has modest sample size  requirements. Green [22] proposed the following heuristic   sample size, N, for a multiple regression with M explanatory  variables and an expected explained variance R2 of the outcome  variable:      N > ({8  [(1  R2) / R2]} + M)  1     (3)     For a large model of 20 explanatory variables with a small  expected R2 of 0.10, the required sample size is 91 messages: =  8  (1  0.10) / 0.10 + 20  1. Less data are needed for a larger  expected R2 or smaller models. Note that statistical power must  be computed at each level of analysis (message, topic, class,  school  country). With 1,330 messages, statistical power  exceeded 0.95 for an effect size of 0.1 at the message level. The  sample sizes at the topic level (13) and the individual level (17)  were very small, so any results at these units must be interpreted  cautiously.     5. RESULTS  5.1  Summary Statistics  In this study, seventeen students wrote 1,330 messages on 13  domain-based, not procedural, topics (e.g., History of CMC,  Different CMC Environments), organized into folders in the  forum. Length of messages were not normalized. Students who  posted more messages on average than other students had the  following profile: older; enrolled in Masters of Arts (MA)  programs; part-time students; not teachers; worked in  technology fields; or had KF experience (older: m = 47 vs. other  m =37 messages; MA: 64 vs. 36; part-time: 47 vs. 27; not  teachers: 55 vs. 36; technology: 54 vs. 39; KF: 44 vs. 32).  Students posted few messages with the following attributes (see  Table 4, panel B): new information (1%), theory (4%), opinion  (5%), elaboration (2%), anecdotal evidence (1%), ask for  explanation (9%), ask about use (2%), different opinion (1%),  and none of the above (83%). (As some messages included more  than one of these attributes, these percentages do not sum up to  100%.)    5.2  Explanatory Model  As none of the second level (topic) variance components were  significant, a single-level analysis was sufficient.  All results  discussed below describe first entry into the regression,  controlling for all previously included variables.  Ancillary  regressions and statistical tests are available upon request.    5.2.1  New Information  The attributes of previous messages were linked to new  information in the current message. After an opinion, new  information was 7% more likely in the next message.  After a  question about use three messages before, new information was  10% more likely. Together, these explanatory variables  accounted for about 26% of the variance of new information.   See Figure 4.    5.2.2  Theorize  Gender and attributes of previous messages were significantly  linked to theorizing.  Men were 22% more likely than women to  theorize.  Demographics accounted for 5% of the variance in  theorizing.    Attributes of earlier messages up to three messages before were  linked to theorizing. After an explanation or an elaboration,  theorizing was 21% or 39% more likely, respectively. If  someone asked about the use of an idea, gave an opinion or gave  a different opinion two messages before, theorizing was 21%,  54%, or 12% more likely, respectively.  After anecdotal   221    evidence three messages before, theorizing was 34% more  likely.  Altogether, these explanatory variables accounted for  38% of the variance of theorizing.      Other variables were not significant. As the I2 index of Q- statistics for each dependent variable was not significant, serial  correlation was unlikely.       Table 4.

DISCUSSION  During asynchronous, online discussions, students have more  time to gather information, contemplate ideas, and evaluate  claims, so they often display higher levels of knowledge creation  than during face-to-face discussions [26][35][42]. Extending this  research beyond aggregate attributes of separate messages, this  study examined the relationships among messages with  statistical discourse analysis. Both individual characteristics and  the micro-sequence context of recent messages cognition and  social metacognition affected the likelihoods of subsequent new  information and theorizing. This statistical discourse analysis  might be fruitfully applied to large datasets (e.g., massive online  open courses, MOOCs) as a vital learning analytics tool.    6.1  Gender  Past studies of primary and secondary school students had  shown that individual differences in gender accounted for little  of the variance in discussion behaviors [8], but this study  showed that these men were more likely than these women to  theorize.  Future studies with larger samples can test the  generality of this result.    6.2  Micro-sequence Context of Recent  Messages  Beyond the effects of individual characteristics, both cognitive  and social metacognitive aspects of recent messages showed  micro-sequence context effects on subsequent messages. These  results showed that asynchronous messages are more than  simply lists of individual cognition [44]; instead, these messages  influence and respond to one another.     Informal cognition (opinions, elaborations, anecdotes) often  preceded formal cognition (new information, theorizing). After a  message containing an opinion, messages containing New  Information and Theorizing were more likely to follow.  Anecdotes and elaborations were also more likely to be followed  by theorizing. Together, these results are consistent with the  views that familiar, informal cognition is often activated before  more formal cognition [9] and that the former can facilitate the  latter through spreading activation of related semantic networks   both in the individual and among group members [37].  This  order of informal cognition before formal cognition also reflects  the social nature of knowledge building discourse; individuals  share their informal experiences, which group members  consider, reshape and integrate into formal, public, structured  knowledge. For educators, these results suggest that students  often share their ideas informally, and teachers should  encourage students to use one anothers ideas to create formal  knowledge.    Social metacognition, in the form of questions and different  opinions, also affected the likelihoods of new information and  theorizing. Reflecting students knowledge interests, their  questions identify key goals and motivate knowledge building.  Questions asking about use of a particular idea had the largest  effect on inducing more new information, showing their power  to influence others behaviors, which is consistent with Bereiter  and Scardamalias [5] conceptions of design mode teaching  and earlier research (e.g., [8]). Furthermore, both types of  questions elicited more theorizing, which is also consistent with  earlier studies (e.g. [34]). These results suggest that educators  can design instruction to give students autonomy or collective  cognitive responsibility [40][47] so that students can create  their own learning goals (or at least subgoals) and ask questions  to motivate themselves and their classmates to build knowledge  that is meaningful to them. Lastly, a different opinion had the  largest effect on a subsequent theory, consistent with past dis- equilibrium research showing that disagreements provoke  explanations (e.g., [14]). Together, these results suggest useful  prompts that a teacher might encourage students to use during  online discussions, for example through brief cue cards or direct  teacher questioning.    6.3  Statistical Discourse Analysis  As the large data set includes participant-coding of their  messages, SDA offers the potential for semi-automatic analyses  that integrates multiple analyses encoded into computer  programs on large data sets such as the online discussions of  massive open online courses (MOOCs). If participant coding  yields sufficiently similar categories of codes (an open and a  valuable research area), the codes can be entered into SDA-    Male   Ask about  use (-3) Opinion (-1)   New  information  Ask about use (-2) Anecdote   (-3)   Opinion (-2)   Different  opinion (-2) Elaboration (-1)   Ask for  Explanation (-1)            Theorize   +1.66 *   +2.31 **   +1.67 *   +3.25 *  +2.12 *   +1.44 *   +2.97 *   +3.30 **  +2.23 *   223    encoded computer programs, and users can test explanatory  models.     This study showcases a methodology for analyzing relationships  among individual characteristics and non-linear, asynchronous  messages during an online discussion. Such analyses must  address analytic difficulties involving the data, the dependent  variables and the explanatory variables. First, data issues include  missing data, nested data and the tree structure of online  messages. Second, difficulties involving dependent variables  include discrete outcomes, infrequent outcomes, similar adjacent  messages and multiple outcomes. Lastly, explanatory variable  issues include sequences, indirect effects, false positives and  robustness of results.     SDA addresses each of these analytic difficulties as follows (see  Table 3). First, SDA addresses the data issues (missing data,  nested data, tree structure of online messages) with Markov  Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation (MCMC-MI),  multilevel analysis, and identification of the previous message.  Second, SDA addresses the dependent variable difficulties  (discrete, infrequent, serial correlation and multiple) with Logit  regressions, a Logit bias estimator, I2 index of Q-statistics, and  multivariate outcome analyses. Lastly, SDA addresses the  explanatory variable issues (sequences, indirect effects, false  positives, robustness) with vector auto-regression, multilevel M- tests, the two-stage linear step-up procedure and robustness  tests.             6.4  Limitations  This studys analytic categories and data might sharply limit the  utility of its results for other students, groups, activities and  contexts. These mostly dichotomous analytic categories are a  first step toward a more comprehensive set of categories.  Furthermore, the sample sizes of students (17) and courses (1)  can be expanded in future research. Future research can also  model actual time and students reading behaviors in addition to  their writing behaviors.      7. CONCLUSION  This study extends the online discussion research beyond  aggregated attributes of separate messages to relationships  among messages by showcasing how statistical discourse  analysis can model these relationships. The results showed that  both individual characteristics and the micro-sequence context  of recent messages cognition and social metacognition affected  the likelihoods of subsequent new information and theorizing.  Unlike past studies of students, this exploratory study with a few  students suggests that gender in adults might account for  substantial differences in online behaviors. Specifically, men  were more likely than women to theorize. Rather than simply  being lists of individual cognition, asynchronous messages  create a micro-sequence context that affects subsequent  messages. Informal cognition (opinions, anecdotes, elaborations)  facilitates more formal cognition (new information and  theoretical explanations). Meanwhile, social metacognition, in  the form of questions and different opinions, had the strongest  effects on subsequent new information and theoretical  explanations.            8.

The present study attempts to uncover temporal patterns that distinguish productive threads of knowledge building inquiry. Using a rich knowledge building discourse dataset, in which notes' contribution types and threads' productivity have been coded, a secondary temporal analysis was conducted. In particular, Lag-sequential Analysis was conducted to identify transitional patterns among different contribution types that distinguish productive threads from improvable ones. Results indicated that productive inquiry threads involved significantly more transitions among questioning, theorizing, obtaining information, and working with information; in contrast, responding to questions and theories by merely giving opinions was not sufficient to achieve knowledge progress. This study highlights the importance of investigating temporality in collaborative learning and calls for attention to developing and testing temporal analysis methods in learning analytics research.

In particular, Lag-sequential Analysis was con- ducted to identify transitional patterns among different con- tribution types that distinguish productive threads fromim- provable ones. Results indicated that productive inquiry threads involved significantly more transitions among ques- tioning, theorizing, obtaining information, and working with information; in contrast, responding to questions and theo- ries by merely giving opinions was not sufficient to achieve knowledge progress. This study highlights the importance of investigating temporality in collaborative learning and calls for attention to developing and testing temporal analysis methods in learning analytics research.

Thus, analysis of collaborative learning processes needs to attend to interpersonal interactions where group cognitions emerge [21], as well as interactions among ideas and conceptual ar- tifacts from which knowledge progress occurs [20, 6].  The significance of the temporal dimension for under- standing collaborative learning has been recognized by ear- lier research. However, in contrast to a wide spectrum of other popular techniques, it was only recently that tempo- rality was explicitly recognized as an important angle for an- alyzing collaborative learning [3, 7, 9, 24]. This phenomenon could be attributed to a theoretical gap, in that learning theories generally do not take temporality into considera- tion [15]. It could also be caused by a methodological chal- lenge, as little guidance is available for gathering temporal data and studying temporality of collaborative learning [8]. The present study attempts to bridge this gap, by advancing Lag-sequential Analysis as an analytic method emphasizing temporality and by showcasing its application in studying students knowledge building dialogues.  2. BACKGROUND  2.1 Temporality of learning processes A defining characteristic of interaction is that it unfolds  in time. This notion is reflected in extensive research of col- laborative groups [20, 21]. However, it is surprisingly rare that researchers investigate the temporal dimension of learn- ing. In most collaborative learning studies, a quantitative method referred to as coding and counting is normally ap- plied [22], which involves coding interaction data, counting occurrences of different types of interactions, and inspecting significant links between occurrences and interested learn- ing outcomes. In some cases this approach is combined with narrative accounts of group interactions attending to causal and temporal links among interaction types. Undoubtedly, such analyses based on coding and counting are useful in uncovering patterns attributing to productivity of collabora- tive learning. However, applying such a coding and count- ing approach often means the loss of temporal or sequential information of interactions. As pointed out in previous re- search [7], measures produced by this approach tell us a certain proportion of interactional content that was coded in a particular category but nothing about the sequence of  226    different categories; by aggregating counts over time, data get flattened out in the time dimension and information about temporal variation is unfortunately abandoned.  A growing body of research is starting to attend to the temporal dimension of collaborative learning. For example, Wise and Ming analyzed temporal patterns of knowledge construction in online discussions, focusing on consequences of role assignments [24]. By applying statistical discourse analysis attending to the progressive nature of knowledge construction, they identified pivotal postsposts initiat- ing new segments of discussion of higher knowledge con- struction qualityand found that assigning a summarizing role mid-discussion can facilitate group knowledge construc- tion. In another study, Dyke and colleagues incorporated interactive sliding window visualizations to understand how interactions develop over time and provided means to detect temporal irregularities in collaborative learning [3]. Also in- terested in applying visualization techniques, Halatchliyski and colleagues developed a novel approach of tracing idea flow in an online learning community based on scientomet- ric methodology [6]. By tracing temporal flow of ideas, their visualizations could help characterize contribution profiles of different authors. In summary, analyzing the temporal dimension of collaborative learning is fruitful and deserves more attention in learning analytics research.  2.2 Ways of contributing to knowledge build- ing discourse  The need for analyzing temporality of discourse could be well demonstrated in research of knowledge building, which is a renowned constructivist pedagogy in the learning sci- ences [20]. To help students see ideas as knowledge builders, knowledge building pedagogy puts ideas at the center and engages students to take cognitive responsibility for improv- ing them through communal discourse [18]. Such discourse is normally supported by Knowledge Forum, an online com- munity space where students can contribute ideas in the form of notes to shared knowledge spaces, or views [19]. Previous research has extensively documented various epis- temic roles in knowledge building classrooms, including pos- ing questions, drafting hypotheses, and designing experi- ments to collect data in order to test hypotheses [18, 25]. From a research perspective, an intriguing question is how the synergy of different types of contributions could bring about productive discourse that effectively advances knowl- edge. To start tackling this question, researchers focusing on mapping dialogue moves important to knowledge build- ing discourse have developed an inventory of ways of con- tributing to explanation-seeking discourse by applying the grounded theory approach on multiple years of Knowledge Forum notes produced by Grade 1-6 students [2]. Table 1 shows the current version of this scheme, which includes six major contribution categories and 24 sub-categories. This scheme has been useful in guiding content analysis of stu- dent online discourse and eliciting ways of contributing mea- sures potentially useful for diagnosing discourse [13]. How- ever, previous research in this area has neglected the tem- poral relations among different contribution types. Because knowledge building discourse is thought to be a complex, collaborative process of theory building that involves inter- actions among facts, theories built to explain facts, and var- ious types of actions to improve theories [20], without any understanding of the temporal relations among different con-  Table 1: Ways of contributing to knowledge building discourse coding scheme.

The traditional coding and counting approach flattens plural, complex discourse data and falls short in ad- dressing interactions among different contribution types.  To bridge the gap of analyzing temporality in discourse- centric learning such as knowledge building, the present study advances Lag-sequential Analysis as a temporal analytic tech- nique and applies it in knowledge building discourse analysis. More specifically, this study attempts to answer the follow- ing research question: Suppose we could reliably assess the productivity of a knowledge building dialogue, what under- lying temporal patterns could distinguish dialogues which promote knowledge advancement  3. METHODS To tackle the research question, we performed secondary  analysis of knowledge building discourse data already coded in previous research.  3.1 Data sources Data analyzed in this study consisted of one year of Knowl-  edge Forum notes, collected from Grade 1-6 students who were doing knowledge building in science. These students were from a knowledge building school in downtown Toronto. In this school, there is only one class in each grade, with ap- proximately 22 students in each class. In this school, knowl- edge building pedagogy is introduced to students from Ju- nior Kindergarten and Knowledge Forum is used from Grade 1. Thus, all students and teachers involved in this study were comfortable with this pedagogy and the supportive technol- ogy. In a typical school year, science learning in all grades is organized around an overarching topic, such as water or trees, which further expands to a few big ideas in that con- tent area. Students bring in their authentic problems of un-  227    derstanding, build explanations together based on their real ideas, and make constructive use of authoritative sources when necessary to improve their ideas. To make their ideas public and open to be improved by the community, students write notes in Knowledge Forum extensively.  In this study, a total of 1101 notes produced by six grades were analyzed. An overview of the grades, science units, and number of analyzed notes in each unit is provided in Table 2. Primary data analysis on this dataset was conducted in previous research concerningways of contributing to knowl- edge building discourse and knowledge advancement in sci- ence learning [2, 13, 12]. This analysis included three as- pects: (1) coding types of contribution in each notebased on content analysis using the aforementioned ways of con- tributing scheme; (2) identifying inquiry threadsthrough grouping sets of notes by shared principal problems [25]; and (3) determining productivity of each inquiry threadbased on whether there was any occurrence of improving an ex- planation in the ways of contributing scheme (see Table 1), inquiry threads were divided into productive and improvable categories. Two raters coded all notes and achieved a cu- mulative agreement rate of 95.52% (Grade 1, 99.27%; Grade 2, 98.65%; Grade 3, 82.5%; Grade 4, 99.57%; Grade 5/6, 97.63%). Previous reports of this dataset have mainly fo- cused on percentages of contribution types and derived mea- sures such as contribution diversity and contribution rich- ness [1, 12].  3.2 Data analysis To recognize temporality as an aspect of analysis on this  dataset, we examined the transitional relations among con- tribution types in knowledge building discourse. Toward this end, we applied a temporal analysis technique named Lag-sequential Analysis (LsA) [16] on the dataset. Gener- ally, one central goal of LsA is to determine whether there is cross-dependence between a specified behavior and an- other behavior that occurs earlier in time [4]. It identifies contingency relationships in a sequence of observed behav- iors and enables researchers to explore cross-dependencies occurring in complex interactive sequences of behavior. As a simple and valuable method for summarizing interactions between behaviors, it has been found useful for studying in- teractions in many different contexts, including disruptive behaviors in classrooms and small group interactions [5, 11]. Comparing to counting measures in content analysis, LsA takes transitional relationships between contribution types into account. Thus, it could reveal significant insights into the temporal differences between productive and improvable knowledge building dialogues that are otherwise neglected.  To conduct LsA in this study, and to make LsA more ac- cessible to other researchers as well, we implemented an R program based on previous studies [10, 17].1 Using this R program, we computed a number of LsA measures, includ- ing: (1) transitional frequencies among all major contribu- tion typeshow often a particular transition occurred for a specified sequential lag; (2) expected transitional frequency the expected number of times a transition would occur under the null hypothesis of independence or no relation between the codes; (3) transitional probabilitiesa conditional prob- ability indicating the likelihood of, for example, behavior B occurring, given that behavior A occurred (the probability of  1Code is available at https://github.com/dirkchen/LsA un- der the GNU General Public License, version 3.

To uncover possible temporal patterns, we further compared these LsA measures between productive and improvable threads. Yules Q was finally adopted to represent the strength of transitional asso- ciation because it controls for base numbers of contributions and is descriptively useful (with a range from -1 to +1 and zero indicating no association).  4. RESULTS  4.1 Were productive and improvable threads different in basic contribution measures  The first comparisons between productive and improvable inquiry threads were made on a set of basic ways of con- tributing measures. These measures included: (1) number of discourse units (each unit is defined by a unique type of contribution rather than Knowledge Forum note), (2) num- ber of discourse units after merging adjacent units of a same contribution type, (3) occurrences of each main contribution category, and (4) percentage of each main contribution cat- egory. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics of these basic contribution measures. To compare differences of produc- tive and improvable inquiry threads, t-tests were conducted on these measures. Results found none of these descrip- tive measures significantly different between two types of threads. Thus, counting measures of contribution types were not adequate in predicting productivity of knowledge building discourse.  4.2 Uncovering sequential patterns: Transi- tions among contribution types  Analysis of the basic measures did not identify any signif- icant difference between productive and improvable threads. So what has made them different Although previous stud- ies found numbers of theorizing and working with informa- tion contributions predicted individual knowledge advance- ment [2], these measures fall short in predicting progress at the group level. If occurrences of contribution types were not proper indicators, was it because of the interplay among dif- ferent contribution types Were some contribution types fol- lowing each other more often in productive threads With- out analyzing temporality of knowledge building discourse an important piece of the story remains missing.  To tackle this problem, Lag-sequential Analysis measures were computed with sequential lag set as 1, focusing on di- rect transitions. To compare temporal difference between  228    Table 2: An overview of dataset.

It could be inferred that in productive threads students worked more constructively with resources and engaged in deepen questioning, as they incorporated information into theoriz- ing and questioned proposed theories more often. Mean- while, productive threads had less transitions from theo- rizing to supporting discussion (t(44) = -2.23, p < .05), as well as slightly less supporting discussion to question- ing (t(40) = -1.83, p = .08). Detailed analysis found most supporting discussion fell into the providing an opinion sub- category. It appeared responding to theorizing and ques- tioning by merely giving opinions was not sufficient for ad- vancing knowledge.  To expand the analysis from immediate transitions to in- direct transitions, we set sequential lag as 2 and applied the same Lag-sequential Analysis process. Results indicated productive threads had more indirect bidirectional transi- tions between questioning and obtaining information (t(45) = 1.88, p < .05 and t(40) = 1.99, p = .05), as well as be- tween theorizing and obtaining information (t(46) = 1.91, p = .06 and t(42) = 1.83, p = .07). Therefore, the integration of obtaining information with questioning and theorizing is also contributing to idea improvement. At the same time, similar to the analysis of immediate transitions, significantly less indirect transitions from questioning to supporting dis- cussion (t(34) = -2.00, p = .05) and from supporting discus- sion to theorizing (t(35) = -2.06, p < .05) were identified in productive threads.  5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The present study argues for the importance of exam-  ining temporality in collaborative learning. Using a rich Knowledge Forum dataset, it attempts to investigate tem- poral patterns that can predict productivity of knowledge building discourse. To go beyond the coding and count- ingapproach applied in many learning sciences studies, this study applies Lag-sequential Analysis to study transitional relations among different ways of contributing in productive and improvable dialogues. As results indicated, while tra- ditional counting measures fall short in distinguishing two types of dialogues, a few sequential patterns were identi-  2Considering the space limit, only pairs of contribution types that were found significantly different between two types of threads are presented in the table.

In particular, productive threads of inquiry involved significantly more transitions among questioning, theorizing, obtaining information, and working with information, while improvable inquiry threads showed more transitions involv- ing giving opinions. Therefore, responding to questioning and theorizing by merely giving opinions is not sufficient to achieve knowledge progress in knowledge building. These findings are consistent with existing literature in recognizing the importance of constructive use of authoritative sources as an important component of productive knowledge build- ing [18, 25]. The bidirectional linkages between obtaining information and theorizing or questioning also highlight the progressive characteristic involving deepening inquiry as an important feature of effective discourse [20].  This study builds on previous research that highlights the importance of temporality. It contributes to learning analyt- ics literature by introducing knowledge building perspectives and to knowledge building research by uncovering temporal patterns worth further investigation. By developing an R program, it also makes Lag-sequential Analysis more acces- sible for researcher. For future directions, we will explore possibilities of developing embedded knowledge building an- alytic tools to boost identified favorable discourse behaviors. Given manual content analysis applied in this study appears non-feasible for developing large-scale, real-time assessment tools, substantial efforts is needed to automate the process of coding by applying recent computational linguistics tech- niques [14]. Since previous studies have showed efficacy of fairly simple tools in facilitating metadisourse and boost- ing students competencies [13], future work of knowledge building analytics based on the present study shows great promise in promoting collaborative learning.  6.

However, as noted in the McKinsey report, the strategic  application of analytics [16] to inform practice has not been  extensive within the education sector. Simply put, while the  education sec- tor is data rich it has historically been analytics  poor. The limited use of analytics in education, apart from the use  of business intelligence to improve organizational efficiency, is  clear in several areas. For instance, the lack of access to easy to  use dashboard and analytics tools for educators and learners and  the absence of any systemic deployment of learning analytics that  informs the organizations learning and teaching practice.  Arguably this dearth of institutional wide exemplars is in part due  to the need for analysts and researchers to rapidly demonstrate the  potential data mining and analytics to improve learning while  dealing with the complexity of messy data and the  organizational political challenges that arise due to various  stakeholders and data owners.   The outcome of limited systemic analytics activity is a  predominance of research that is founded on the extraction of  readily available data such as those drawn from learning  management systems (LMS), student information systems (SIS),  and basic demographics and student grades. Thus, the research  questions have tended to centre on identifying key variables that  inform student retention and academic performance. However,  these commonly bivariate analyses are the low hanging fruit  in terms of the overall potential for analytics to redefine and  shape education praxis. The goal here is not to condemn prior  analytics work to the sidelines of research but to note that the  learning analytics landscape is complex, shrouded in the morass  of social, technical, and cultural problems that pervade the  education sector. While LMS and SIS data can provide insight  into how to improve teaching and learning, this level of focus is  not suitably aligned with the substantial challenges that face all  levels of education  many of which require a systemic and  integrated response. For example, while it is helpful to note that  students who regularly log into a LMS may perform better than  their less active peers, this information is not suitable for  developing a focused response to poor performing students. It is  neither helpful nor productive to simply tell under-performing  students to log in more frequently. Despite the current  limitations, much credit must be given to the early analytics work  for rapidly advancing the profile of learning analytics and raising  awareness about the value of educational data among a diverse  set of stakeholders such as researchers, senior education  administrators, government, industry, and funding bodies. LMS  or SIS data can be a useful proxy for seeing a part of a problem,  but it is insufficient to serve as a model for intervention that is     231    based on the current state of learning sciences [ 1 ] . Learning  analytics to date has served to identify a condition, but has not  advanced to deal with the  learning challenges in a more  nuanced and integrated manner.   This paper is an evaluation of the current state of the field of  learning analytics through the analysis of articles and citations.  Literature in learning analytics under the broad umbrella of the  Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) and Learning  Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conference now spans four  years. A growing diversity of disciplinary approaches is evident  in analytics literature, reflecting a field at the intersection of  numerous academic disciplines. For instance, the field draws on  assorted theory and methodologies from disciplines as diverse  as education, psychology, philosophy, sociology, linguistics,  learning sciences, statistics, machine learning/artificial  intelligence and computer science. As the learning analytics  field further evolves and matures it is important to reflect on  the diversity of disciplines and methodologies that have  contributed to the current state of learning analytics research. In  so doing, there is a need to identify the emergence of trends and  disciplinary hierarchies that may influence the future direction of  the field.   An evaluation of the current state of learning analytics provides  numerous benefits for the development of the field, including:    a foundation for future research through the  acknowledgement of past research activities;    assistance for grant-making agencies by identifying promising  research areas that align with regional and national education  goals;    identify disciplines that are under-represented and require  more strategic and targeted support and funding opportunities;    identify gaps in research for researchers and students; and   improve the integration between theory and practice by   identifying connections between researchers and papers.   This raises questions relating to the future impact and direction of  learning analytics and how more granular and nuanced analytics  activities can be deployed to facilitate uptake and application  among an expanded set of stakeholders (e.g. research, government  bodies, education administrators, technology support, and  faculty). To address these questions this paper explores  through the lens of structured mapping and citation networks the  research domains and relationships that have extensively  contributed to the field to date. An investigation of the patterns  that evolve from citation networks can indicate the emergence  of new inter- disciplinary research and methodological clusters  alongside the identification of the more established and  mature sub-communities. In undertaking a mapping and review  of the collaborations that have evolved in the field, researchers  and practitioners can identify the cliques and sub-culture that  define the broader learning analytics community. As the 2014  LAK conference theme suggests, learning analytics at the  cross roads, this is an ideal time to reflect and to assess if the  field is moving to this intersection of research (and research  disciplines) with learning theory and practice.    2. CITATION AND AUTHOR NETWORKS  BRIEF OVERVIEW  The development and evolution of a scientific discipline can be  considered as a complex system. As new knowledge is generated  it is influenced by a wide and inter-related set of factors such as  peer review processes, ethics, other closely aligned research    disciplines and priorities in government funding to name but a  few. Recently, the quantity and quality of the research activity  within a discipline has been subject to a variety of measures to  determine the overall impact and hence societal value. For  example, as part of the research quality framework, the  Australian government introduced the Excellence in Research for  Australia as a process to assess the overall quality of university  based research. Citation profiles and analyses are central  measures adopted in these practices in order to determine  research impact. This is founded on the basic notion that a core  product of any research is the publication of scientific papers in  journals and conferences. As the products of this research  (papers) are developed they build upon and therefore cite other  related and aligned research. Although there is much  subjectivity regarding an individuals motivation to cite a  particular author [6], pragmatically citation counts continue to be  used as a proxy of impact. The core of the debate over the validity  of citation analysis relates to the lack of assessment of the quality  of the paper. As Waltman et al., [20] argued, highly cited  papers are not always indicative of impactful research. However,  as the authors further noted, on average this premise does tend  to hold true. As such, it is reasonable to assume that high citation  rates do reflect a certain level of quality [23].   Although there has been an increase in the use of citation and  author analytics for quality assurance processes and  benchmarking, these forms of analytics have long been adopted  measures to indicate an authors or publications relative  influence and prominence within a research network [12]. In the  late 1920s Gross and Gross [11] simply listed the citations  made in the Journal of the American Chemical Society as a  method to inform the strategic allocation of resources for journal  acquisition in a library, specifically for the chemistry discipline.  The conclusions drawn from this work can be seen to be an  early process for determining the impact of an overall journal. In  the 1950s Garfields [8] ground-breaking work laid the  foundation for contemporary work in citation analysis. Garfield  established the Science Citation Index  a large and multi- disciplinary database now accessible via the web of science.   Current citation databases such as Elseviers Scopus, Google  Scholar, web of science and others have made the extraction of  co-citations and identification of co-author networks more  accessible. As such, the development of citation networks have  been adopted to identify disciplinary cliques or what Tight [19]  refers to as the tribes and territories located within a broader  research network. This data set is formed when for instance,  Paper A refers to a previously published Paper B. This citation  process can be seen to establish a tie between actors that  ultimately forms a network.   There are multiple approaches to analyze this bibliometric data.  For example, a network can be established through author to  author ties or via direct citation. Co-authorship networks are  generally adopted to provide an overview of the key contributors  within a particular field. Collectively, authorship and citation  analyses identify the distribution and accumulation of capital that  develops as a research field evolves. Examination of these forms  of capital can provide insight into the emergence of disciplinary  hierarchies. Our aim for this paper is to provide a mapping of  the learning analytics research community to identify the:    prominent papers referred to in the research;   dominant disciplines and methodologies adopted in learning   analytics; and   232     diversity of research paper genres that comprise learning  analytics (e.g., opinion papers, reviews, conceptual, empirical  research, etc.).    3. METHODS  This section details the data collection and analysis process under-  taken in the study.   3.1 Data Collection  In this study, we included all papers that were published in the  first three editions of the International Conference on Learning  Analytics and Knowledge (LAK 2011, 2012, & 2013) [5 ;  9 ;   18 ] . The LAK conference was chosen as this is the major  forum for the field of learning analytics and as such provides a  solid foundation for examining the influential papers, authors,  disciplines and methods that comprise learning analytics to date.  To further compare and supplement this data set we examined  three special issue journals. We identified three such special  issues published since the first edition of the LAK conference   namely the Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks  (JALN 2012, vol. 16, no. 3, 2012); Journal of Educational  Technology & Society (ETS 2012, vol. 15, no. 3, 2012) and the  American Behavioral Scientist (ABS 2013, vol. 57, no. 10). In  the following, we refer to these conferences and special issue  journals as collected papers. A more comprehensive analysis  comprising the entire collection of journal papers published on  the topic is extremely complex and would require conducting a  systematic review [ 1 3 ] . As the goal of our study was to  provide an initial assessment of the emerging author and citation  networks the publication sources was restricted to the conference  and specific special issues occurring in t h e  international  journals. As such we also recognize that the extraction of authors  and citations for the current study is an incomplete set of all  research that has been undertaken within the broad scope of  learning analytics. As these datasets become more complete we  will be able to evaluate whether the findings presented here are an  accurate reflection of the corpus or a result of the early analytic  models employed and interpretations of this preliminary work.  From the collected papers, we extracted information on the  authors of the research and the list of references cited per paper.  Furthermore, we collected data relating to the home discipline  for all listed authors of the collected papers. This was  accomplished by examining the affiliation of the authors  w i t h in the collected papers (e.g., if a researcher was affiliated  with a computer science department, we assigned computer  science as the home discipline for this author). In cases where  such details were lacking in the collected papers we undertook  searches through institutional websites, and social networking  sites such as LinkedIn. Lastly, the methodology employed for  each submitted paper was determined along with the papers  genre (e.g., conceptual, empirical, or review papers).   3.2 Data analysis  The collected papers and the extracted information were analyzed  using social network analysis and content analysis. Two social  networks were established based on the collected information: i)  author network and ii) citation network. The author network was  created by including all authors as nodes and creating edges  between co-authors. For example, if nodes A1, A2, and A3 co- authored paper A, we created nodes A1, A2, and A3 and  established the following edges: A1 - A2, A1 - A3, and A2 - A3  (i.e., the author network was undirected). The citation network  was formed by extracting the authors of both the collected  papers and their citations. Edges were created between the    authors of the collected papers and the authors of their citations.  For example, if actors A1 and A2 co-authored a paper A, in  which they cited paper B written by B1, B2, and B3, we created  five nodes A1, A2, B1, B2, B3. Hence the following directed  edges in the citation network were established: A1 - B1, A1 -  B2, A1 - B3, A2 - B1, A2 - B2, A2 - B3. The nodes in the two  networks were assigned the following attributes: i) home  discipline, ii) type of research contribution of the co-authored  papers, and iii) types of research methods used in the studies  reported (see below for the details about the content analysis and  the attributes under ii) and iii)). The three networks were analyzed  using the following well-established measures in social network  analysis [3; 4; 7; 22]:    Degree  the number of edges a node has in a network   Closeness  the distance of a node to all other nodes in the   network;   Betweenness  the number of shortest paths between any two   nodes that pass via a given node;   Eigenvector  the measure of influence of a node;   Diameter  the maximum eccentricity of any node in a net-   work;   Modularity  a measure of decomposability of the network   into modular communities.   Clustering co-efficient  measure of completeness of the   neighborhood of a node in a network when applied to a single  node and is the average value of the clustering coefficients of  all the nodes in the network.   All social networking variables were computed using the Gephi  open source software for social network analysis [2]. As noted  above content analysis was undertaken to determine two  important research facets, namely: i) the types of contributions  that the collected paper offered; and ii) the type of research  methods adopted in the studies reported within the collected  papers. For the analysis of the papers based on their  contribution type, we followed the classification scheme  commonly adopted in the areas of information systems and  software technology [10; 17; 24]. The classification included the  following categories: (1) Evaluation research provides an  assessment of a particular problem and/or solution in practice  and is typically based on research methods such as case study or  field experiments; (2) Validation research investigates and  proposes a novel technique or a solution that has not been not  implemented in practice and is typically based on research  methods such as rigorous analysis, experiments, and simulations;  (3) Solution proposal is a novel or substantial extension of an  existing method or technique and usually offers an example  scenario of the proposal accompanied with a critical analysis of  pros and cons of the proposal; (4) Conceptual proposal offers a  new perspective to the phenomena under study and the structure  of the field through a taxonomy or a conceptual framework; (5)  Opinion-oriented papers offer positions on certain problems under  study of broader interest for the field; and (6) Experience reports  outline insights into the experience accumulated w i t h in  projects. In addition, we extended this classification with the  category of panel/workshop paper to be able to be inclusive of  all categories within the L A K  conference proceedings.   Analysis of the research methods adopted was undertaken using  the following coding scheme: (1) qualitative method  indicating  a well-established qualitative research method such as content  analysis or grounded theory; (2) quantitative method  referring to  well-established quantitative research methods such as  hypothesis testing using statistical tests performed on the data  collected through surveys, software logs, and social networks;     233    (3) mixed-methods  indicating a combination of qualitative and  quantitative research methods; and (4) Other  includes papers  such  a s  reports of analyzed literature, or d i s c u s s i o n  of a  particular topic or field more generally.     4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  4.1 Citation counts and network  Based on the extraction of the data detailed in the methods section  above, the following counts of citations were calculated. The  counts of individual citations are confined to a score of 1  regardless of how many times an individual paper may actually  cite a specific publication. For example, reference may be  made to a specific publication several times within a paper  however this is weighted the same as an alternate publication  with only a single mention. Examination of the number of  citations a publication receives can reveal insight into the types  and distribution of influential articles.  Table 1 lists the highest cited papers to date aggregated across the  LAK conferences and special issue journals. Predictably given the  stage of learning analytics research, the commonly cited papers  are largely conceptual and review based. The exceptions being  Macfadyen and Dawsons [14] empirical work and Wasserman  and Fausts [21] oft cited book on SNA methodology. The  reference to SNA methods reflects the volume of learning  analytics re- search incorporating network analyses. The adoption  of SNA techniques may also be indicative of researchers  grounding their work in more socially oriented learning theory.  However, further investigation is required to substantiate this  claim. The high number of conceptual and review papers are  indicative of the perceived need for authors to define and explain  the learning analytics field in order to ground their work. As the  field further evolves the need to re-establish a common    understanding and definition of learning analytics will  presumably decrease. In so doing, future analytics authors will  increasingly draw upon more foundational and innovative  empirical work. While direct citation counts are commonly used  and provide a benchmark for future assessment, a richer more in- depth analysis is required. For instance, Ding et al., [6] analyzed  the number of and location within a publication where repeat  citations occur. The authors argued that in order to determine  influential papers in a field research should include the assessment  of the number of re-cites and where these re-citations occur. Our  future work in this area will seek to include these analyses to  determine if repeat citations are significantly different in terms of  identifying the key actors in the learning analytics landscape.  Table 2 provides an overview of the number and diversity of  citations across the investigated publications. Calculation of the  top 20 citations as a percentage of the total indicates this grouping  only represents a small subset of the network. This finding  suggests there is a high level of diversity in the references the  authors are drawing upon. The 20-40 top citations band also  accounts for a relatively low percentage across all the reviewed  publication sites. This is to be anticipated given the relative  immaturity of the LAK conferences and the field in general. As  previously disparate disciplines are brought into the collective  learning analytics space there is a re-orientation of discovery of  the established literature. For example as authors with a  strong computer science back- ground engage with the  education literature there is a necessary phase of discovery  within this domain. As such, the subsequent interpretation and  application is therefore strongly influenced by this alternate  home discipline. Other authors with a similar back- ground will  presumably orient towards their more closely related network  peers. This clustering effect can be determined in the network  calculations.

The network has been configured to highlight the clustering.  Nodes sized by degree centrality              235    The clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which  individual nodes in a network group (cluster) together (small  worlds) [22]. A network clustering coefficient of 1 indicates that  each node in the neighbourhood is completely connected.  Conversely a score of 0 would indicate there are no connections.  Analysis of all citations in the special issue journals revealed a  moderate average clustering coefficient of 0.46 and a network  diameter of 5 (Table 3). Calculation of the modularity score  further indicates a high level of neighbourhood clustering.  The modularity score [3] in this instance was 0.78 at maximum  resolution identifying 22 communities (Table 3). Interestingly  when accounting for all citations made across the LAK confer-  ences the clustering and modularity measures are very consistent  with the special issue publications (Table 3).    However, the network diameter was observed to be greater with  a score of 10. This suggests a more loosely connected network.  Figure 1a and 1b illustrate the clustering occurring within the two  networks, i.e. special issue journals and LAK conferences.  Figures 1a and 1b also illustrate that the network appears to  have few highly connected nodes. The degree centrality measure  can be used to identify the highly cited nodes in the two  networks. The degree centrality has been frequently used in  bibliometric analyses to identify highly connected actors in a  co-citation network. Identification of these nodes reveals  researchers that tend to bridge both computer science domains and  education. For ins tance the development of specific tools  deployed and evaluated in the education space as well as  educational psychology research using technologies.

For the purposes of this article we created a network,  where a connection between two authors is established when  they have a common paper in the investigated publication sites.  The analysis of all authors represented across the LAK  conferences demonstrates numerous small cliques with few  highly interconnected authors. Figure 2 provides a  representation of the author network for all LAK conferences  where the majority of papers have 2-3 co-authors. This would  appear smaller than the authorship profile in natural sciences for  example where 3 or more are the norm [15]. While this paper  presents a commencement point for these analyses in the  learning analytics domain, future work should ideally draw in  data from citation databases such as Scopus, and Google  Scholar. This will provide a more complete assessment of the  disciplinary connections that feed into learning analytics  research. To this end, analysis of the disciplinary background of  the authors can also be used to reveal the types of research that  influences the field. Figure 3 illustrates the dominant  disciplinary background of the authors represented in the LAK  conferences. Clearly the conference is at present dominated by the  computer science field representing approximately 51% of all  authors. Education is also dominant with 40% of all authors  having a background in this area. Several disciplines that would  be expected to be prominent in learning analytics are limited their  in influence to date including: machine learning, artificial  intelligence, statistics, and data mining. Interestingly, at this stage  of the learning analytics development there are relatively few  inter-disciplinary nodes. However, as new researchers enter this  space, and undertake their PhD and post-doctoral fellowships  directly in learning analytics there will be a stronger identification  of the juxtaposition of multiple disciplines and methodologies.  Arguably, the researchers currently representing the field bring an  established methodology and mindset influenced by their  disciplinary theory, past experiences and approaches to research.  The promotion of more inter-disciplinary teams and t h e   emergence of new PhD candidates will result in new  approaches and novel methods to tackle the key learning analytic  challenges.           Figure 2: Network of all authors in the LAK conferences (nodes sized by degree centrality)       Figure 3: Network of all authors in the LAK conferences coded by disciplinary background. Red: Computer Science; Blue: Education;   Green: Other (Industry, Engineering; Linguistics; or Business) (nodes sized by degree centrality).  237            Figure 4: Disciplinary background of the authors represented in the special issue journals. Red: Computer Science; Blue: Education; Green:  Other (Industry, Engineering; Linguistics; or Business) (nodes sized by degree centrality)   A similar comparison with the special issue journal suggests that  while the computer science discipline dominates the LAK  conference the journal publications are more popular for authors  with an education research background. This finding may well  reflect the differences in the publication impact viewed by the  specific disciplines. For instance computer science researchers  tend to place much value on the conference proceedings  in  particular the partnership LAK has secured with the Association  for Computing Machinery digital library (ACM). In contrast  education researchers place a greater emphasis on journal  publications - particularly a journal with an established and  high impact factor. This separation is one of the organizational  challenges that need to be addressed to avoid a fragmentation of  the field. That is, how does Society for Learning Analytics  Research (SOLAR), the major driver of the LAK conference,  ensure the field does not separate into discipline dominated  publication sites. Learning analytics is inter-disciplinary research  and as such the conference proceedings and the newly  established Journal for Learning Analytics research must provide  an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to cross the  boundary lines of their disciplines.   4.3 Practical implications  The analysis conducted in this paper can provide an  understanding for how a field such as learning analytics evolves  and matures by detailing the emergence of key authors, papers,  thematics and the types of papers that are currently influencing  the field. The intent of our analysis is not to offer a road map  forward in the development of the discipline. Science and  research can be influenced, but not scripted. As such, structured  mapping and citation analyses serve primarily to raise  awareness about the structure and attributes of knowledge in a  discipline.  Numerous implications arise from our analysis, including:    the development of curriculum in the growing number of  academic programs that include learning analytics as a topic;       promotion of under-represented groups and research methods to  the learning analytics community;    fostering the development of empirical work and decreased  reliance on founding, overview and conceptual papers; and    improved connections to sister organizations such as the  International Educational Data Mining Society.     As indicated in Figure 5, the diversity of research contributions  and the research method used by the authors across different  disciplines is broad. It is clear that both the conference and the  journal special issues are dominated by the lack of conventional  research methods and that the authors, regardless of the home  discipline, mainly contribute proposal solutions to the conference.  They clearly indicate a much higher rigor in the use of research  methods by the researchers from education, who primarily use  qualitative research methods. This is also corroborated by the  higher numbers of papers in the category of evaluation research  by the researchers from the education home discipline. Category  other is the most common for research methods for the papers  published in the journals. This category is now dominated by  computer scientists and educators. This category is characterized  by either reporting of descriptive statistics of (ad hoc)  questionnaires, comparison of literature, or description of potential  usage scenarios without actual data collection or formalization. The  conference is dominated by proposal solutions authored by  computer scientists and educators. The second most common  category are evaluation research papers, which are dominantly  authored by computer scientists followed by educators, who had al-  most an equal number of contributions in opinion papers, personal  experience papers, as well as validation research. The second most  important category for computer scientists was validation research.  Again, the most common method for the conference is other   which is really not a formal method, but typically an ad hoc write  up of personal experience, some random statistics and comparison  with the literature. It is interesting that the conference has more  dominated by the use of quantitative methods, which probably has  to do with the higher number of computer scientist.     238         Figure 5a: Cross-tabulation of the authors home disciplines (i.e., numbers in the circles represent the number of authors) with both research   methods reported in the journal papers and types of journal papers.

After distinguishing humane education from training on the basis of the Aristotelian model of intellectual capabilities, and arguing that humane education is distinct by virtue of its interest in cultivating prudence, which is unteachable, an account of three key characteristics of humane education is provided. Appealing to thinkers of the Italian Renaissance, it is argued that ingenium, eloquence, and self-knowledge constitute the what, how, and why of humane education. Lastly, looking to several examples from recent learning analytics literature, it is demonstrated that learning analytics is not only helpful as set of aids for ensuring success in scientific and technical disciplines, but in the humanities as well.

After distinguishing humane  education from training on the basis of the Aristotelian model  of intellectual capabilities, and arguing that humane education  is distinct by virtue of its interest in cultivating prudence, which  is unteachable, an account of three key characteristics of  humane education is provided.  Appealing to thinkers of the  Italian Renaissance, it is argued that ingenium, eloquence, and  self-knowledge constitute the what, how, and why of humane  education.  Lastly, looking to several examples from recent  learning analytics literature, it is demonstrated that learning  analytics is not only helpful as set of aids for ensuring success  in scientific and technical disciplines, but in the humanities as  well.  In order to function effectively as an aid to humane  education, however, learning analytics must be embedded  within a context that encourages continuous reflection,  responsiveness, and personal responsibility for learning.

INTRODUCTION  Can learning analytics be used as an aid to humane education     This is not a question about the compatibility of learning  analytics and teaching in the humanities.  Rather, it is a question  about the use of learning analytics to cultivate capabilities that   are themselves unteachable, and yet are also vital to research  and innovation in the sciences and humanities alike.   Aristotle offers a helpful model of human intellectual  capability, according to which the ways in which humans know  and learn are organized along two axis: necessity and  teachability [1]. Episteme (often translated as scientific  knowledge) basically involves the application of deductive rules  like the law of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded  middle.  Rules like these are teachable and result in necessary  truths.  The weakness of this approach to knowledge, however,  is that it is incapable of arriving at its own first principles.  This  is the role of nous (translated as understanding), which, like  scientific knowledge, yields necessary truths, but unlike  scientific knowledge is unteachable.  Nous is inductive and  dialectical, the result of experience and experimentation.   Arriving at truths characterized by unqualified necessity, truths  that are eternal by virtue of the fact that they are neither created  nor destroyed, is the combined task of episteme and nous, or  what Aristotle also refers to as sophia, wisdom.   Table 1. Aristotles Model of Human Intellectual Capability      Teachable  Knowledge   Unteachable  Knowledge   Necessary Truths      episteme      nous   Contingent Truths      techne      phronesis      Aristotle also identifies two intellectual capabilities concerned  with arriving at contingent truths, because they involve material  things and concrete situations.  Techne (craft knowledge), on  the one hand, is knowledge concerned with production.  It  consists of teachable information and skills that allow artisans  to bring about states of affairs that are different from those  specifically implied by their materials.  Chairs do not grow on  trees, and there is nothing in a tree that would in itself imply a  chair.  Given the right knowledge and skills, however, the  craftsman can effectively bring about a chair from what might  easily otherwise become a table, a spoon, wood for burning, or  merely be left to rot.  On the other hand, phronesis (or  prudence) is the practical wisdom to bring about the right end in  the right way at the right time and with the right     Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Because prudence is a capability directed toward  concrete situations in the social world, the truths at which it  arrives are contingent: the same behavior performed rightly in  one situation may not, in fact, be prudent in another.  What this  also means is that the exercise of prudence is not ultimately  reducible to a set of abstract rules.  Although craft knowledge  involves contingent truths, it is nonetheless possible to codify  best practices and teach because the domain in which it acts   the  material world  is consistent and predictable.  The domain  with which prudence is concerned, however, is characterized by  constant change.  There can be no rigid set of teachable rules  for effectively navigating the social world.  Instead, what is  required here is the ability to quickly and accurately assess a  situation in order to act rightly, without also affirming the  absolute rightness of that activity in itself.  According to  Aristotle, prudence is a capability that cannot be taught.  It can  only be learned over time and through experience:   Whereas young people become accomplished in geometry  and mathematics, and wise within these limits, prudent  young people do not seem to be found.  The reason is that  prudence is concerned with particulars as well as  universals, and particulars become known from  experience, but a young person lacks experience, since  some length of time is needed to produce it. [1]   What kind of learning takes place in the humanities  The  question is unhelpful, uninteresting, and perhaps even  misleading.  If we consider the humanities as a set of  institutionalized disciplines represented in courses that students  must take in order to fulfill the requirements of their degrees, it  should be obvious that learning analytics can here be of  tremendous utility to instructors and students alike.  Just as in  STEM disciplines, which are teachable by virtue of the fact that  they obviously involve episteme and techne, there are elements  of each of the humanities that are teachable as well.  When  something is teachable, it is also measurable, since what is  taught are sets of standards against which work is  evaluated.  Just as a student's mastery of mathematical concepts  may be assessed and compared against an objective standard of  correctness, so too may a student's mastery of logic be assessed  and compared against the standards of validity and  soundness.  Just as a chemistry student is evaluated on the basis  of their ability to apply a set of principles in order to generate a  particular outcome in a lab, so too is an English student  evaluated on the basis of their ability to apply a set of  grammatical rules in order to generate an intelligible  text.  Every discipline, in order to be a discipline, consists of a  generally accepted body of knowledge, and the success or  failure of a student is a function of that student's ability to  absorb, recite, and apply that body of knowledge.  In the  context of higher education, then, there is nothing about the  disciplinary humanities that would render learning analytics  incompatible.  If it is teachable, then it can be measured; if it  can be measured, it can be compared; if it can be compared,  then it can be evaluated; if it can be evaluated, then it can be  improved.  A dominant view of learning analytics is that they  function like feedback systems: mechanisms for monitoring  events relative to range of acceptable conditions, and producing  alerts when significant deviation from the norm calls for timely  correction.   An interesting and important question, then, is not whether  learning analytics might be of some use to teaching in the  humanities, but rather whether learning analytics might also be  of some value relative to unteachable types of learning.  Put  differently, this paper represents an early and provisional effort  to explore how practices involving learning analytics might also  serve to cultivate prudence.  As Aristotle argued, phronesis is  the ability to arrive at ingenious insights that address particular  sets of circumstances here and now.  This intellectual capacity  cannot be taught.  It can only be learned through the  accumulation of experience.  This is not a humanistic education,  since the humanities are just as teachable as the sciences.  Nor  is it exclusive to the humanities, since this kind of creative and  ingenious activity is absolutely crucial to the practice of  scientific research.  Phronesis is not humanistic, but it is  humane, since it is in the area of practical wisdom that human  creativity and ingenuity are allowed to flourish.   Looking to several thinkers of the Italian Renaissance, this  paper will argue that humane education is neither a techne nor  an episteme.   Rather, humane education is a set of practices  concerned with cultivating prudence.  In other words, unlike  education as it is most often conceived  which would perhaps  be better described as training  the object of humane education  is what cannot be taught.  In spite of the fact that humane  education concerns itself with what cannot be taught, and so  with what cannot be measured, this paper will argue that  learning analytics is not only an effective teaching aid, but that  it is also not incompatible with practices associated with  humane education.  The compatibility and use of learning  analytics as an aid to non-teaching, however, demands a shift  in perspective away from the feedback paradigm, and toward  one that uses analytics to produce reflective opportunities that  encourage self-knowledge.  This is not to say that what we need  is a paradigm shift in learning analytics in general, but rather  that we need to carefully identify and consider the kinds of  intellectual capabilities that we wish to foster in a particular  learning context, and adapt our methods accordingly.  At  present, most thinking about learning analytics has been  oriented toward the cultivation of episteme, and techne.  The  use of learning analytics to achieve these ends is obviously  helpful, and should in no way be discouraged.  Thinking  learning analytics through the lens of humane education,  however, provides us with an opportunity to expand its  application to another knowledge domain in addition to, and  along side, others.  In fact, the use of a common set of tools to  address multiple knowledge domains allows for the possibility  of tremendous synergies, such that encouraging one domain  will see an augmentation in the insights generated from within  another.  As we know all too well from the field of learning  analytics, data do not speak for themselves.  Their  interpretation, rather, relies on flashes of insight made possible  only as a result of an ingenuity that is itself neither scientific  nor technical, but rather a function of experience, of prudence.   If we can use learning analytics to cultivate phronesis at the  same time as episteme, techne, and nous, how much more  successful will our students be, especially as they prepare to  contribute in a world that, perhaps more than any time before, is  characterized by constant change          242    2. HUMANE EDUCATION  Acknowledging that the space of this short paper does not allow  for much more than a caricature of humane education as it  developed in the Italian Renaissance, I want to highlight three  important aspects addressing three crucial questions that must  be addressed by any philosophy of education: What is to be  taught How is it to be taught And to what end must it be  taught  Of course, none of these questions can be answered  without also assuming the answer to the others, but these  questions do offer a helpful organizing framework for  understanding some key elements of humane education.     2.1 ingenium  In answer to the what question, humane education does not  imply any particular method (an episteme) or content (techne),  and so is not actually concerned with teaching at all.  Rather, it  is concerned with cultivating the habits and sensibilities  required in order to be responsive to particular situations.  For  Renaissance Humanists, the task of education was to cultivate  ingenium, or the capacity to rally disparate and apparently  unrelated elements, and put them together in a way that  addresses the demands of a particular here and now.  Describing  the thought of Leonardo Bruni, for example, Ernesto Grassi [2]  brilliantly summarizes the importance of ingenium as follows:   For Bruni ingenium and not ratio is that last resort  when we have to respond to the appeal which arises out of  individual and variable situations.  Versatility, agility,  versutia belong essentially to the ingenium, while ratio  is essentially rigid.  Rigidity results from the rational  determination of beings, while the versutia arises because  language has to be versatile or agile in responding to the  situation and to the context of the work: []  Through its  own acumen, the ingenium discovers relationships  and similarities, similitudines.  This is why the  ingenium as fast as lightning. [2]   The what of humane education is not a content or a method,  but rather an openness to the world, a practice of embracing  information from multiple and diverse sources in order to be  prudent and decisive at a moment that calls for action.   2.2 Eloquence  But how is the teacher supposed to teach the unteachable  The  humane answer is eloquence.  Inspired by Cicero and  Quintillian, Verene argues that the purpose of teaching is to  produce a self that can think and that information and skills  will fall in line behind this [6].  The task of the teacher is to be  copious, to present the whole of a subject, and to encounter that  subject with the same ingenious skill that the teacher wants to  inspire in their students.  With Ellul, Verene is suspicious of the  humiliation of the word which seems to characterize our  modern age, and insists that, where the word has been replaced  by the image in politics, by technique in the sciences and  everyday life, and by hermeneutics in the literary and critical  arts, the classroom is the one place where the word might  survive.  In the service of the truth as the True, which is the  whole, it is incumbent upon teachers to present students with  copious knowledge in speech, inciting a holistic approach to  knowledge while also modeling the ingenious activity which is  the content of humane education.   Through eloquence, the student is not taught, but rather seduced  into a personal relationship with a world of knowledge.  A key  insight of humane education is that we are all autodidacts.  In  other words, it matters not how much material a teacher  delivers, nor the ways in which it is delivered.  Ultimate  responsibility for learning lies in the heart of the learner.  In his  influential treatise On the Character and Studies Befitting a  Free-Born Youth, Pier Paolo Vergerio observes that everyone  acquires for himself the liberal arts and virtue itself, and these  are the most desirable things a person can seek [5].  An  eloquent teacher, then, not only presents the whole of a subject,  and models ingenium, but also seduces their students into a  personal relationship with knowledge, a strong sense of  personal responsibility for their learning. The teacher-student  relationship is not one in which some datum is effectively  transferred from one mind to another.  Instead, the teacher  functions as a liaison between the student and knowledge with  the task of showing, modeling, and inspiring.    2.3 Self-Knowledge  If ingenium is the content of humane education, and eloquence  the means, then what is the end of humane education  What is  the aim in the service of which ingenium is eloquently  cultivated  On the one hand, for the humanists of the Italian  Renaissance  who were tremendously influenced by Ciceros  De Oratore  this general aim was truth, by which they meant  knowledge of the whole.  On the other hand, and more  specifically, they gave a special place to self-knowledge.   Giambattista Vico, for example, insisted that knowledge of  oneself is for everyone the greatest incentive to acquire the  universe of learning in the shortest period of time [8].  From  the humane perspective, the end of education as a relationship  between teacher and student is merely to bring the student into  an understanding of themselves and in such a way as to make  learning possible.  In order to maximize the students potential  for learning, the student must first come to an understanding of  themselves as an ingenious agent responsible for their learning  activity.  Understood as ingenious, the student will avoid the  trappings of over-specialization, since the ability to act in the  right way and at the right time increases exponentially to the  extent that the student has acquired complete knowledge of a  situation.  In the absence of this kind of self-understanding, as  deliberative, ingenious, and decisive, the specialized student  will be inclined either to avoid decision for lack of complete  knowledge, or worse, make poor decisions from lack of  knowledge about the whole of a situation.  Understood as  responsible, the student will come to see learning as something  that actually has very little to do with the classroom.  From the  humane perspective, the classroom is a site of seduction and of  guidance.  From an institutional perspective, the classroom is a  site of evaluation and of ranking for the sake of  credentialization and professionalization.  In neither of these  situations is the classroom a place of learning distinct from any  other context or situation.  Learning is an activity of the learner,  and involves a learners relationship to knowledge.   It is only  once the connection between teaching and learning has been  severed in the minds of learners that they can truly flourish.            243    3. HUMANE ANALYTICS  There are two basic approaches to learning analytics, which I  will here refer to as objective and humane.  The former treats  the students performance as an object abstracted from the  learning context.  A student is measured, assessed, on the basis  of that assessment, provided with adjusting or affirming  feedback in order to ensure that their performance remains  within an acceptable distance from a given standard of  achievement.  Typically, this takes the form of an automated  system intended to prompt timely interventions by alerting an  instructor, student, or other stakeholder when some level of  activity (performance, logins, clicks, etc.) is not met.  What  makes such an approach objective is not in the nature of the  systems used, but rather the way in which feedback systems are  abstracted from the context of learning itself.  An objective  approach would see learning and learning analytics as separate  activities: learning takes place, then that learning is taken as an  object of analysis in order to make improvements to the  learning context.  The data-driven teacher is then put in the  position of constantly bouncing back and forth between the  context of learning and the context of analytics.  From an  institutional perspective, concerned with ensuring that students  achieve at least a minimum measurable standard of  performance, this is an effective technique.  And a technique it  is, for it amounts to the application of a series of rules  accompanied by a standard set of intervention procedures.  The  objective approach to learning analytics is itself teachable, and  so lends itself very well to teachable things.   Humane learning analytics may use the same technologies and  tools as the objective approach, but it is distinct in that it fails to  distinguish between the context and learning and the context of  analysis.  Rather than view learning analytics as separate from  pedagogy, the humane non-teacher views learning analytics as  itself a pedagogical tool.  In the world of personal fitness  tracking, the long-term behavioral impact of an activity monitor  is a function of the extent to which users actively reflect upon  their data.  A pretty dashboard does not itself influence  behavior.  It is only with regular and thoughtful engagement  with ones data and goals that such personal feedback systems  have any long-term impact [3].  The same is true of learning  analytics.  From a humane perspective, which sees teaching as  guiding the student to an understanding of themselves as an  ingenious problem-solver responsible for their learning,  learning analytics is not about providing performance feedback,  but rather about creating opportunities for students to reflect on  their activities and behaviors relative to goals that may extend  far beyond the walls of the classroom.  A humane approach to  learning analytics, then, sees the context of analytics, not as  separate from the context of learning, but rather as a context of  learning in itself.   A good example of a humane approach to learning analytics is  seen in Wise, Zhao, and Hausknecht [9]. In addition to  incorporating embedded analytics within a Visual Discussion  Forum Environment, which informed student contributions by  allowing them to easily assess activity-level and depth of  conversation thread, they also made use of extracted analytics  that allowed students to see the extent to which they were  achieving various participation criteria, such as number of  contributed posts, average post length, number of reviews of  posts by self and others, etc.  Acknowledging that analytics are  worthless unless data are seriously engaged, Wise, Zhao, and   Hausknecht explicitly built reflection upon analytics into their  course design by providing an explicit time and space for  reflection upon analytics.  Using a series of private wikis,  students were required to set concrete goals for their own online  discussion participation.  When the students were periodically  given extracted analytics, they were also given a series of  questions upon which they were called to reflect upon in their  journal.  Because the wiki entries were shared between student  and instructor, the instructor was able to review and respond to  in the same space.     Wise, Zhao, and Hausknecht fostered personal responsibility for  learning by creating a situation in which learners actively and  reflectively engaged their data relative to personally defined  goals.  The fact that these structured reflective opportunities  took place in the context of dialogue between student and  teacher made these opportunities immanently pedagogical  exercises that used data as a point of entry into a larger, more  holistic understanding of the learning situation.  This holism  was further encouraged by the value the authors place on a  diversity of metrics.  Lastly, the value of parity was seen in the  fact that teachers not only engaged their students in dialogue  about their journal reflections, but also openly reflected about  their own data.  In this scenario, both educator and student  entered as learners.     Another approach to learning analytics that holds promise for  humane education is social network analysis.  Although their  conception of learning, as a shorthand to include any  enhancements of individual or collective knowledge or skills,  whether or not it occurs in formal educational settings is  dissatisfying by virtue of the fact that it would seem to  indiscriminately include any and all forms of experience,  Suthers and Rosen [4] argue that associograms can be useful  tools for identifying sites where an educational intervention can  reach many participants in a given network.  Here, far from  using the term intervention to refer to a feedback mechanism  for ensuring a particular level of performance, it is rather used  to describe an opportunity to engage in eloquence.  For the  Humanists, eloquence meant communicating the whole of a  subject.  To be sure, there is an ontological impulse at work  here, a striving to do justice to the thing itself.  More  importantly, however, the holistic aim of eloquence is  motivated by an interest in the audience.  The task of the  humane educator is not to teach, but rather to move.   [] the relationship between speaker and listeners is of  the essence.  It is in tune with the opinions of the audience  that we have to arrange our speech.  It often happens that  people unmoved by forceful and compelling reasons can  be jolted from their apathy, and made to change their  minds by means of some trifling line of argument.   Consequently, in order to be sure of having touched all the  soul-strings of his listeners, the orator, then, should run  through the complete set of loci which schematize the  evidence. [7]   Loci are literally places, points of contact between a claim being  demonstrated and the world views of individuals.  In order for a  humane educator to be effective, they must identify those places  where the opinions, interests, and values of their students might  possibly begin to resonate with what is otherwise foreign.   Having identified such places, the task of the humane educator   244    is to exercise their ingenuity in demonstrating the possibility of  bridging the gap between known and unknown, and compelling  their students to make ingenious connections for themselves.  In  large classes and in the context of asynchronous online  environments, it can be very challenging for educators to  identify those loci, those places where particular interventions  are likely to have the greatest impact.  Social network analysis  has the potential to overcome this kind of obstacle and in so  doing, rehumanize a process that might otherwise be an  alienating.    In using data to create opportunities to meet learners in terms of  their own existing opinions, values, and goals, to encourage  them to understand themselves as autonomous agents  responsible for their learning, and to empower them to exercise  their powers of ingenium, the teacher fosters self-knowledge  and reflective agility in ways that complement and humanize a  more standard and objective approach to learning analytics.   Reflective pedagogies and social network analysis not only  demonstrate the compatibility of learning analytics and humane  education, but also provide concrete examples of approaches  that might be included within a larger vision of what a humane  learning analytics might look like.  The use of learning analytics  as a pedagogical instrument in these ways is exciting, because it  serves to cultivate those very humane sensibilities that, for  Aristotle, are in themselves unteachable.

INTRODUCTION  Researchers and practitioners from many disciplines (e.g.  statistics, behavioral science, cognitive psychology, education,  and computer science) have worked to define and establish  Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) as a discipline.  However, because work within respective fields can typically  include a myopic view, finding the identity of a new discipline  can be difficult and complex in terms of a more holistic view  and in terms of finding purpose. In her paper, Mapping the  Research Questions in Technical Communication, Carolyn  Rude proposed a method to strengthen disciplinary identity  and provide direction for a maturing field of study [11]. Her  motivation for such an undertaking was that the technical  communication field lacks the status, legitimacy, and power of  mature professions and that we cannot be recognized by  others if we cannot even recognize ourselves. Her purpose  was to define the field of technical communication both  internally and externally, to determine what was unique to  technical communication, and to identify knowledge gaps.    Modifying Rudes methodology to the emerging field of LAK  can help identify areas of strength as well as provide guidance  for future research and activities. While Rude examined four  areas of inquiry to unbundle technical communication  (disciplinary, pedagogy, practice, and social change), this  paper will review LAK theory, research, practice, and ethics as  guided by a modified subset of Rudes questions:      Theory: How shall we know ourselves, what is unique to  learning analytics that defines it as a field of study     Research: What are our definitions, history, status,  possible future, and research methods in learning  analytics     Practice: What should be the content of our courses and  curriculum to teach students best practices, history, and  possibilities     Ethics: Why is learning analytics important and how are  we maintaining an ethical viewpoint as it relates to  learning analytics      This paper will also discuss the ethics of learning analytics  artifacts, review consequences of learning analytics use, and  suggest an ethical literacy for learning analytics. Why choose a  technical communication perspective Technical communica- tion exists at the intersection of multiple disciplines and  facilitates information flow from practitioner to public  a  situation and purpose in common with the LAK discipline.    2. MATERIALS AND ANALYSIS  LAK conference abstracts (2011-2013) were used as a body of  knowledge for this review. Although the abstracts are a limited  resource, the motivation for focusing on the LAK abstracts is  two-fold. Those outside of the discipline, or new to the field,  would certainly refer to the conference proceedings as a  comprehensive body of knowledge when searching for  information on learning analytics. Therefore, it is a test of the  accuracy and quality of information in the conference  abstracts: a way to determine if LAK conference authors  describe their work in a way that provides clarity and focus.     2.1 Theory  To understand which theories LAK conference authors  referenced, a search on the terms theory, theoretical, theories,  and framework was conducted and produced 30 occurrences  (18 unique abstracts). Many abstracts spoke of borrowing  theory from another discipline for theoretical guidance.  Borrowed theoretical frameworks included cultural,  postmodern, identity, ecological system, item response,  reflective learning, social networked learning, sociocultural,  technology enhanced learning, and learning sciences. Other  abstracts did not use the specific search terms but were clearly  trying to define the discipline theoretically. Framework was  also a common term throughout the abstracts, with 27   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies  are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

From this search, it appears common for the  emerging discipline of learning analytics to borrow theories  from other disciplines in order to test the waters.     How shall we know ourselves, what is unique to learning  analytics that defines it as a field of study One abstract, by  Templar, Heck, Cuypers, Kooji, and Vrie) [16], described their  research as building on the previous learning analytics  framework of Shum and Crick [13]. It is in this type of testing  and retesting of methods in learning analytics that allows a  discipline to develop and strengthen their own unique  disciplinarity and theoretical frameworks whether borrowed,  enhanced, or proposed as new. For now, practitioners and  researchers in the field of learning analytics could reduce  confusion for newcomers to the field by clearly defining their  research as empirical or theoretical.    2.2 Research  To explore current research topics in LAK conference  abstracts, a search was conducted on the terms research,  empirical, and analysis and resulted in:       Research: 83 matches, 46 unique abstracts   Empirical: 12 matches, 10 unique abstracts   Analysis: 78 matches, 50 unique abstracts     Rather than list specific abstracts here, Figure 1 reveals where  learning analytics research is engaged: Teaching and Learning  (65%), Methodology (27%), Visualizations (5%), and Policy  (3%). Figure 2 separates out Communication Analysis  (abstracts with discourse, linguistics, or textual analysis) from  Teaching and Learning, as Communication Analysis was the  largest component of Teaching and learning.    What are our definitions, history, status, possible future, and  research methods in learning analytics Definitions and  history of learning analytics have been well defined. As a  discipline, learning analytics is clearly focused on the research  of teaching and learning, and specifically on communication  analysis within teaching and learning research. The strength of  teaching and learning research is not surprising. A quick word  count within the LAK abstracts reveals a predominant  occurrence of such terms as learning and learners, students,  course, environments, online, and support. It is interesting that  methodology comprises a smaller portion of the research  topics. As was determined in the previous search for the term  theory, the discipline is still looking to other theoretical  models to advise its own theory. More research on  methodology will develop and strengthen LAKs  disciplinarity. One possible focus for future research in  learning analytics is discussed in Section 3 of this paper.        Figure 1. Combined Topics of Research at LAK   Figure 2. Detailed Topics of Research at LAK    2.3 Practice  Tools and methods of practice define a disciplines pedagogy.  To better understand LAK practice, the search terms pedagogy  and pedagogical were used to reveal a variety of abstracts  related to teaching methods and tools. There were two types of  abstracts, those that sought to teach instructors how to use  learning analytic tools in the classroom (SNAPP, AAT,  Sherpa, to name a few), and those that offered some level of  theoretical pedagogy. The LAK conference abstracts are a  robust source of cutting-edge pedagogical practices, but the  depth and breadth of pedagogy beyond the conference  abstracts cannot go without mention. LAK pedagogy has  become firmly established by the innovative Massive Open  and Online Courses (begun in 2011), and the subsequent  educational opportunities provided by the Society for Learning  Analytics Research (SoLAR) such as the Learning Analytics  Summer Institute and the distributed research Lab PhD  Training [see: http://www.solaresearch.org].    What should be the content of our courses and curriculum to  teach students best practices, history, and possibilities From  tools and methodology, to assessment and principles of use,  leaders in the LAK discipline are continually and clearly  defining and redefining pedagogy for the LAK discipline, not  only in terms of what instructors need to know, but also of the  content and outcomes of a learning analytics classroom.    2.4 Ethics  For the purpose of this paper, ethics is defined as ethical action   guiding learning analytics by the philosophy of use, the  motivation for use, and working towards a desire to do better  by the institution, the instructor, and the discipline as a whole.  A search for the terms ethics and ethical revealed four  abstracts related to ethical use of learning analytics, from  ethical issues for the institution, to ethical design and ethics as  taught or learned in the classroom [3, 5, 10, 15]. These four  abstracts are certainly a starting point for discussing ethics in  learning analytics, but not more than a starting point.    Why is learning analytics important and how are we  maintaining an ethical viewpoint as it relates to learning  analytics Disrupting and transforming education are key  goals of learning analytics. At a time when our education  models are described as failing, this alone elevates the  importance of learning analytics. However, the conversations  of maintaining an ethical viewpoint within the discipline have  been slow to develop. To begin the conversation, the rest of  this paper will discuss the ethics of learning analytics  artifacts, review the consequences of using learning  analytics, and propose an ethical literacy for LAK.         27%   3% 65%   5% Methodology (32 abstracts)  Policy (3 abstracts)  Teaching and Learning (78 abstracts) Visualizations (6 abstracts)  20%   27%   3%   45%   5% Communication Analysis (24 abstracts) Methodology (32 abstracts)  Policy (3 abstracts)  Teaching and Learning (54 abstracts) Visualizations (6 abstracts)  247    3. ARTIFACTS OF LAK  For those in the field of technical communication, artifacts are  products of a genre and are grouped by content similarities or  context relatedness in order to study rhetorical action. Two  tangible artifacts of learning analytics are data visualizations  and interactive data dashboards used by faculty and students.  A more esoteric artifact is the process of learning analytics  itself (gather, predict, act, measure, and refine). To better  understand how LAK practices mediate knowledge, values,  and action, the question becomes, Who generates these  artifacts, how, and for what purpose, and are these artifacts  produced and presented ethically     Before tackling this question, a brief description of the types of  learning analytics is necessary. In their paper, Social Learning  Analytics: Five Approaches, Shum and Ferguson [14] identify  learning analytics as using dynamic and behavioral data in the  classroom (e.g., attendance, grades, quantified participation).  Ferguson and Shum view learning analytics as a social process  that builds on knowledge created through cultural settings, and  they describe five categories of learning analytics: Social  Network (analyzes relationships), Discourse (analyzes  language), Content (analyzes user-generated content),  Disposition (analyzes motivation), and Context (considers  formal and informal learning). Anyone with access to the  Internet and open source software can create data  visualizations for social network analytics, content analytics,  and discourse analytics (the former if not protected within a  Learning Management System). Disposition analytics can be  self-reporting or a more formal survey and, in each case,  faculty and/or administration would have access to this data.  Currently, context analytics are less commonly used (but  gaining in popularity), and this highly personal data may be  available publicly through mobile technology and applications.     3.1 Artifact: Visualization  Because learning analytic visualizations can be easily created  and posted publicly, situating these artifacts within Laura  Guraks framework for cyber literacy is a good place to begin  identifying ethical issues [6]. Guraks work describes the  speed, reach, anonymity, and interactivity of information  available through the Internet and, when applied to learning  analytics, clear consequences are revealed for each attribute  (Table 1):     Table 1. Attributes and Potential Consequences  Attribute Consequence  Speed: Real-time data  allows for predictive  modeling to occur without  trained analysis by experts   Lack of relationship context  between individual and data,  and historical context of the  individual other than data   Reach: Inaccurate or  incomplete data may be  used in predictive model   Lack of accountability when  predictions created without  verification of statistical  methods or accuracy and  completeness of data   Anonymity: Private data  may be used without  permission or de- anonymized by either  party   Lack of privacy if data may be  harvested without permission  and can be de-anonymized  through implied relationships   Interactivity: Pushed one- way (Institution to student)   Lack of interactivity if artifacts  are not interactive or allow for  feedback   When viewed through Guraks framework, ethical issues for  those working with the artifacts of learning analytics become a  lack of context, accountability, privacy, and interactivity.  Furthermore, the framework as applied to learning analytics  either magnifies or reverses the effect of information:     Lack of context magnifies the problem of speed  Lack of accountability magnifies the problem of reach   Lack of privacy reverses the problem of anonymity  Lack of interactivity reverses the problem of interactivity     3.2 Artifact: Dashboard  In, The Evolving Face of Ethics in Technical and Professional  Communication: Challenger to Columbia, Paul Dombrowski  [2] provides a framework for addressing ethics theory, one that  raises awareness of social and historical context to provide a  variety of approaches to dealing with ethical issues.  Specifically, Dombrowski believes that both ethics and  rhetoric must be considered in, [how] technology is designed,  the way it is actually used, and to some degree even the shape  of the technology itself. Applying Dombrowskis work to  learning analytics and, specifically, to a learning analytics  dashboard, provides ethical questions that can be used to  consider the ethics of the design, use, and shape of technology  of a learning analytics artifact:      Design: Which design or visual elements of dashboards  are persuasive and how might they affect the viewer  How might design or visual elements assign meaning    Use: Where is meaning created beyond the dashboards  label of at-risk How might the student respond to being  labeled without context    Shape of Technology: How does the dashboard function  as an ethical document (power, status, labels, and data)  Is there a way to elevate student over data rather than  view student as data     3.3 Artifact: Methodology  Katz and Rhodes [7] examine ethical issues in relation to  human-computer interaction and identify ethical frames as a  set of philosophical assumptions, ideological perceptions, and  normative values underlying and/or guiding how people relate  to and exist with technology. Describing ethics as being  socially dynamic and constructed, Katz and Rhodes reveal  that, when viewed through ethical frames, technology  constructs social values. Situating the five stages of learning  analytics (gather, predict, act, measure, refine) within Rhodes  and Katz ethical frames indicates that each stage of learning  analytics has potential consequences for affecting social value  (Table 2):    Table 2. Ethical Frames and Potential Consequences  Frame Description Consequence  False Nothing of   value  Learning analytics may be harmful  if predictive category is wrong  (predict)   Tool A Means Prediction is only as good as the  data are accurate and complete  (gather, measure, and refine)   Means- end   A means  and an end   Suggested intervention strategy  may or may not increase student  success (act)   248    The above examples describe how the artifacts of learning  analytics have ethical implications. However, a broader  perspective of ethics in learning analytics must also include a  discussion on the effects of learning analytics on individuals,  faculty, and institutions, and is necessary before establishing a  literacy for learning analytics that includes an ethical  viewpoint.     4. EFFECTS OF LEARNING ANALYTICS  Certainly, the topic of ethics in learning analytics has been  raised at previous LAK Conferences [3, 5, 10, 15]. Willis,  Campbell, and Pistilli [17] connect ethics to learning analytics  by maintaining that the institution is responsible for analyzing  the data and fulfilling an obligation of knowing by providing  students with tools for success, faculty with training to use the  prediction models, and a campus climate the enhances student  success. Slade and Galpin [15] specifically discuss ethical  issues related to learning analytics  from the responsibility  of the institution for student success, to the rights of a student  to remain an individual. Technical communication can build  on this previous work by providing much-needed frameworks  to discuss an ethical literacy in terms of consequences of  classification, social power moves, and the absence of voice.    4.1 Consequences of Classification  In Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences,  Bowker and Star [1] focus on the ambiguous process of  classification and the invisible forces of categories and  standards. Bowker and Star explain that, for the most part, we  are trained to accept classification systems as fact even though  classification is subject to data entry errors, data storage  limitations, data cleaning, and data revision (due to  economic, social, and political pressures). Classifying people  involves generalizing and/or stereotyping in order to create a  data profile that fits into categories and, in doing so,  existing differences are covered up, merged, or removed. As  classifying is the work of learning analytics, the biggest  setback to the process may be, as Bowker and Star explain,  when put into a category people bend and twist their reality to  fit into a more desirable category or, even more  problematic, socialize to their category. Being labeled at- risk may serve as an incentive for those who are motivated  and fortunate to have life circumstances that enable them to  move to a more desirable category but, for others, being  labeled at-risk may influence their outlook for success and  serve to deflate untapped potential.    4.2 Identifying Power Moves  In Multiliteracies for a Digital Age, Stuart Selber [12]  proposes an ethical approach to computer literacy and  carefully dissects where institutional technology regularization  (required use of hardware or software) imposes a social power  differential on individuals (power moves). For learning  analytics, power moves can be revealed by considering the  following questions:       Exclusion/Compartmentalization/Segregation: Do  intervention strategies favor campus-based, face-to-face  activities, prevent benefit to some, or are they difficult to  obtain    Deflection: Is there transparency regarding benefits a  college may receive through increased retention and  tuition    Differential incorporation: Do predictive categories  reinforce status when differentiating by academic  achievement    Centralization: Who owns, shares, maintains, and is  responsible for data accuracy    Standardization/Delegation: Are intervention strategies  specific enough to be effective How does an institutional  assignment of at-risk fit the reality of a student being at- risk or feeling at-risk     Without deeper discussion and reflection learning analytics  may unintentionally reinforce unfortunate classifications,  social power differentials and exclude stakeholder voices.    4.3 Considering Voice  In The Spurious Coin, Bernadette Longo [8] maintains that  those in power marginalize  intentionally or unintentionally   certain knowledge in their efforts to legitimize other  knowledge, and that the only way to change this practice is to  fully explore how and why this marginalization and associated  legitimization occurs within a system. In another work,  Human+Culture: Where We Work, Longo [9] examines  choices that create both culture and community. For learning  analytics, this process would start by considering who has the  power to:       make decisions about the learning analytics model and  data,     legitimize some student knowledge or data and not others,   focus on potential intervention strategies and not others,    give voice to certain students and not others, and    validate some student stories and not others.      Being aware that the learning analytics process legitimizes  preferential selection of data, knowledge, actions, and opinions   allows the LAK community to consider how the process  marginalizes certain voices (and at which stage), and affects  social relationships between students, between student and  faculty, and between student and institution.    Sections 3 and 4 above have outlined ethical issues for  learning analytics related to artifacts (visualization, dashboard,  process) and the consequences of learning analytics  applications (classification, power moves, and voice). Each  section also provided information or questions that can be used  to guide discussion on the ethics of learning analytics. While  identification and acknowledgement is a first step, how might  the LAK community begin to establish an ethical literacy for  learning analytics that is promoted by LAK theory, research,  and practice   5. AN ETHICAL LITERACY  Returning to Selbers work on multiliteracies, Selber suggests  a three-fold approach to literacy that includes functional  literacy, critical literacy, and rhetorical literacy. Applying this  to learning analytics, a LAK literacy could include:       Functional Literacy: Using software to create  visualizations, or to access and navigate a learning  analytics dashboard;     Critical Literacy: Understanding data limitations in  predictive modeling and visualizations/dashboard as   249    limitations of context, accountability, privacy, and  interactivity, and    Rhetorical Literacy: Analyzing visualizations/dashboard  rhetorically (producing knowledge) in terms of persuasion,  power, and ownership.   Selber maintains that all three literacies are needed to fully  account for an ethical viewpoint, and he provides four  categories  persuasion, deliberation, reflection, and social  action  to reveal ethical issues for each literacy. For learning  analytics, this review process answers the following questions:      Persuasion: How are the predictive model,  visualizations, and student dashboard persuasive Where  might there exist potential for harm    Deliberation: Who has control of the learning analytics  conversation (and data sharing) at each stage of the  process Who is left out of the conversation and why    Reflection: How can the learning analytics process be  improved upon Are we following our Code of Ethics     Social action: How are members of the community  (institution and student) benefiting from the relationship  or having a beneficial effect on the community Who has  power and who does not     When guided by this framework, an ethical literacy for  learning analytics will answer the question: Who generates  these artifacts, how, and for what purpose, and are these  artifacts produced and presented ethically The answer to this  question begins with the LAK community articulating ethical  goals, aligning values with practice, and adopting  conversations that are inclusive and transparent.    6. CONCLUSION  LAK is a young discipline theoretically, yet, with already  strong and complex research activities and practices. LAK  practitioners will encounter obvious (and not so obvious)  ethical dilemmas while working in this field. Adopting an  ethical literacy for learning analytics, such as outlined in this  paper, is a first step in maintaining an ethical viewpoint and  fully incorporating ethics into theory, research, and practice of  the LAK discipline.    7.

INTRODUCTION  Learning analytics are concerned with the measurement,  collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their  contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning  and the environments in which it occurs [1]. The intention is to  develop models, algorithms and processes that can be widely  used. Transferability is a key factor here; the analytics that are  developed need to be reliable and valid at a scale beyond the  individual course or cohort.   There are currently few reports in the learning analytics literature  of deployment at scale. In England and Australia, standardized  testing of school children has been employed for decades, through  the English SAT tests and the Australian NAPLAN tests [2, 3].  These tests are aligned with stated government aims, make use of  agreed proxies for learning, provide clear and standardized  visualisations of analytics and drive behaviour at every level of  the education system. The data generated by these tests is  collected, analysed and reported with the intention of optimizing  learning and the environments in which it occurs. Despite the  scale of this deployment, media reports suggest that many  educators, learners and parents have not been convinced that these  programmes are optimizing learning [4, 5].  On an institutional scale, the best-known example of roll-out at  scale is Purdue University. By 2012, the university had applied its  Course Signals analytics tool to over 100 courses, providing      Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies  bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

This is a  significant achievement, but it has taken time. Course Signals is  rooted in a study carried out at the university in 2005 [7]; nine  years of development have not yet resulted in deployment across  the entire university. In the UK, The Open University has been  carrying out the learning analytics process as defined above [1]  for over 40 years, but has also been identifying barriers to the  implementation of that research for more than three decades [8].   2. BARRIERS TO ANALYTICS  RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION   2.1 Barriers identified in 1979  In 1979, McIntosh reported that those of us in the Survey  Research Department continue to be dissatisfied at our ability to  have an impact on many major problem areas [8]. This was  before the development of learning analytics. McIntosh was  engaged in the related area of educational evaluation,  delineating, obtaining and providing information that would be  useful in judging decision alternatives. She identified seven  reasons why competent research findings were never put into  practice. These included an unwillingness for academics to accept  and act on methods or findings from outside their own research  area, individual preferences for qualitative or quantitative  approaches, a tendency to base decisions on anecdote rather than  on research, the different languages used by researchers and  decision-makers, an unfamiliarity with statistical methods on the  part of decision makers, and a tendency by researchers to hedge  their conclusions.   Her recommendations focused on the need for researchers and  decision-makers to work together: Researchers should get clients  politically, emotionally and financially committed to the outcome  of the research. They are then more likely to take notice of its  results [8]. The focus of the article was on university decision- makers as clients; the clientele for learning analytics might now  be referred to as stakeholders and would include learners,  educators and administrators.   2.2 Barriers identified in 2012  In 2012, Macfadyen and Dawson reported on the non- implementation of a study relating to an institutions use of  learning analytics and its learning management system (LMS).  They found that the institutional planning process was dominated  by technical concerns and, because of this, made little use of the  intelligence revealed by the analytics process [9]. Indeed, after  the current state analysis had been completed and noted by the  institutions standing committee on learning technologies,  meeting minutes and reports showed that no references to or  discussions of the findings were made in subsequent meetings.    Macfadyen and Dawson suggest the powerful analytic  conclusions were set aside because the development and  presentation of these analytics was coupled with a lack of  attention to the institutional culture of higher education, a lack of  awareness of the degree of resistance to change, and a lack of  understanding of approaches that have been developed for  motivating change within an organisation. They suggest that  greater attention is needed to the accessibility and presentation of  analytics processes and findings so that learning analytics  discoveries also have the capacity to surprise and compel, and  thus motivate behavioural change [9].   This presents a significant challenge for learning analytics  researchers, whose primary focus is on issues such as the   development and testing of algorithms and visualisations. Few  analytics projects will have the capacity to undertake an  ethnographic study of institutional culture or a review of recent  thinking on change management, or will have team members with  experience of writing a research report that both surprises and  compels its audience. Yet the learning analytics community needs  to investigate these issues and to engage its audience, if it is to  achieve its aim of optimising learning and the environments in  which it occurs.   Initial investigative work has been carried out in this area by Lonn  and his colleagues [10]. They reflected on the issues encountered  and lessons learned when scaling up a learning analytics  intervention. The focus of their reflection was on the benefits and  challenges of institutional partnership between a research team  and a technology service group. They identified gaps between the  two teams in areas such as usability, access, performance and  calculation. In each case, they identified possible solutions,  although many of these solutions were specific to the context in  which they were working.   Overall, although they employ different language and describe  different situations, these three studies identify some common  problems [8-10]. These problems are related to different  expectations around communication between researchers and  those responsible for implementation, different levels of  engagement with the research, and different expectations about  the role and purpose of educational research. These discrepancies  are found in other areas of technology-enhanced learning (TEL)  research, and it is increasingly clear that significant innovation in  this area is not possible without taking into account the entire TEL  Technology Complex [11].   3. TEL TECHNOLOGY COMPLEX  Learning analytics, like other areas of TEL, can rarely be  considered as a set of tools that can be developed, transferred and  immediately adopted by practitioners. There are many associated  elements that must work alongside the analytics in order to realise  their full potential. These can be understood as part of a  technology complex, a series of components that all need to be  addressed together [12]. In the case of TEL and learning analytics,  key components include pedagogy, stakeholders, communities,  current practices, context, technical components and the business  model [11]. When scaling up learning analytics, all these  components need to be taken into account.   The introduction of learning analytics requires changes to the  practices of several communities at once. Educators need to be  able to evaluate them and to use them effectively. Learners need  to be convinced that they are reliable and will improve their  learning without intruding into their privacy. Support staff need to  be trained to maintain the infrastructure and add data to the  system. University administrators need to be convinced that they  are both valid and cost effective. In order to convince all these  stakeholders to put in the sustained effort necessary to make use  of learning analytics, a clear vision of the gains to be made is  required at the outset [11].   4. THE PANEL DISCUSSION  In order to consider how these changes can be carried out  successfully, the panel brings together researchers who have taken  on the task of implementing learning analytics at scale. They will  offer insight into the processes involved, outlining different  perspectives on these, identifying barriers to implementation and  presenting ways of overcoming those barriers.   252    4.1 Rebecca Ferguson and Doug Clow  Rebecca and Doug work as data wranglers at The Open  University in the UK. In this role, they have responsibility for  mediating between different university faculties and the  department responsible for collecting and analyzing analytic data.  They will talk about why the university decided to set up a team  of data wranglers, and some of the implications of their role in  bridging different communities within the university.   4.2 Leah Macfadyen  Leah is Program Director for Evaluation and Learning Analytics  in the Faculty of Arts at the University of British Columbia, and  has several years experience of efforts to garner institutional  support for learning analytics. She will discuss a range of  institutional barriers encountered, and introduce a systems  framework that may allow more careful analysis of structural and  cultural blockages in institutions, and identification of points for  intervention.   4.3 Alfred Essa  Alfred is Vice President, Analytics and R&D at McGraw-Hill  Education and was, until August 2013, Director of Analytics  Research and Strategy at Desire2Learn. There, he led product  development on the Student Success System, a set of predictive  analytic tools that was incorporated within the companys cloud- base learning systems. He will talk about his experience of scaling  analytics up for use across institutions and across national  boundaries.   4.4 Shane Dawson  Shane is Deputy Director of Academic Learning Services at the  University of South Australia and has extensive experience of  developing and implementing learning analytics. He will discuss  his research into problems encountered when working to  implement analytic findings at institutional level, and introduce  ways of overcoming the barriers to success.   4.5 Shirley Alexander  Shirley is Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Vice-President (Teaching,  Learning and Equity) at the University of Technology, Sydney.  Her responsibilities include enhancing the quality of the  universitys teaching, creating an environment of innovation and  excellence in teaching and learning. She will talk about her  experience of implementing analytics across a university.     5. REFERENCES  [1] SoLAR, Open Learning Analytics: An Integrated &   Modularized Platform.

INTRODUCTION  The use of social media has been growing in university  classrooms, with some surveys reporting adoption rates as high as  80% among university classrooms in the United States [15]. Such  use capitalizes on the wider social networks reachable via social  media while simultaneously meeting the student population where  it lives: i.e., online, in social networking sites and in the  microforms of communication adopted in Twitter and texting.  There are many potential benefits to using social media in  association with education and classroom settings. For example,   by having access to social media, students can continue  discussions started in one class and carry them over to another.  Students also have a chance to view and build on conversations  with others outside the classroom, such as practitioners and  experts in the field or students who took the same class in a  previous semester. Furthermore, social media can be used to  create a community of learners, which persists beyond the current  class, sustaining students as life-long learners. Recent research in  this area suggests that whether one is submitting questions via  Twitter, blogging about current events related to general themes  of the class, or using Facebook to carry out class discussions,  students class participation, engagement, and sometimes even  performance, are likely to increase once social media are  introduced into the mix [2], [13], [17]. However, how do  educators and learners know that their particular use of social  media is beneficial to their teaching or learning This is a problem  for many educators and researchers looking for validation that  social media are truly aiding teaching and learning processes.    The main objective of this research is to determine and evaluate  measures that can help educators manage their use of social media  for teaching and learning through the use of automated analysis of  social media texts and networks. In a face-to-face class, it is  relatively easy to see who is participating or not. It is also  relatively easy in online classes to track progress and student  participation with the help of reporting functionalities offered by  modern Classroom Management Systems like Blackboard.  However, when learners and educators are engaging with each  other and with communities outside the classroom via social  media, educators and researchers who are studying learning  processes quickly find themselves inundated with datasets that  dwarf more conventional survey- or interview-based datasets. Yet,  data volume alone does not fully speak to the enormity of the task  associated with analyzing online data. To exploit an online dataset  fully, researchers often need to examine the same set of data in  multiple passes, each time looking for different aspects of  interaction and learning. Some of the many facets they can look at  include common patterns of exchange, development of shared  language and understanding, and the emergence of roles and  positions that may be unique to online interactions. Multiple  analyses such as these take a substantial amount of time to  accomplish when managed by hand.

The research conducted by the panelists contributes to the  emerging field of learning analytics [12], [18]. It adds  understanding, methods, and tools for learning analytics by  developing and testing automated measures to study learning  processes occurring in social media, based on the discovery and  analysis of social structures among class participants. In  particular, this research focuses on developing and evaluating new  approaches for the discovery of learning networks generated from  social media activities by class participants. Such networks signal  engagement through interaction and discussion with fellow  learners and instructors. Once discovered and properly evaluated,  these networks offer efficient and effective ways to assess  learning (especially collaborative learning) and teaching  effectiveness: first by making the dataset more manageable, and  then by identifying patterns in the data and creating effective  modes of evaluation or intervention.  The panel will report on the progress of the first year of this five- year research initiative with a particular focus on the lessons  learned during the data collection phase. Specifically, the panelists  will discuss two main data collection instruments that are  currently being used by the research team: (1) the development  and roll out of the online survey designed to discover different  approaches to social media integration and evaluation for teaching  among educators and (2) the automated collection of publicly  available interaction data generated by MOOC participants to  study social interactions among online learners. Below is a brief  description of each data collection instrument. The presentation  will conclude with a general discussion of what can be learned  from data collected from the perspectives of researchers,  instructors, students and administrators.   2. ONLINE SURVEY  Since there is a general lack of knowledge regarding how and to  what extent instructors integrate social media in their teaching, the  first year of this initiative focuses on completing a comprehensive  survey of different approaches to social media integration for  teaching. To accomplish this goal, we are conducting an online  survey among instructors around the globe to survey their  teaching methods with social media. The aim is to understand  how they align social media with the learning objectives of their  classes and what kind of formal assessment criteria for the use of  social media instructors use. The goal is to collect as many case  studies as possible. The primary research questions that will be  addressed by the survey are as follows:    What specific social media are being used for teaching, and  for what intended learning outcomes    What are the common assessment strategies of social media  use for teaching and learning used by instructors   The panel will discuss the implementation and roll out of the  survey.   3. MOOC DATA  In parallel to conducting the survey, we are also reviewing a  number of case studies involving the implementation of social  media in the context of higher education, specifically focusing on  a number of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOC is  an emerging format of online courses designed for a large number  of participants that uses an open access, web-based platform and a  set of social media tools to conduct a class. This new format of  distance and distributed learning is rapidly gaining in popularity   worldwide. For example, in the United States, MOOCs are being  offered by institutions such as MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley. In  Canada, the leader in offering MOOCs is the Technology  Enhanced Knowledge Research Institute (TEKRI) at Athabasca  University. As a case, we are collecting and examining publicly  available user-generated data from a number of MOOCs offered  by TEKRI including courses on Connectivism and Connective  Knowledge (CCK), Personal Learning Environments and  Knowledge (PLEK), Learning Analytics (LAK).    The user-generated data collected during this step will be  used to discover and study emerging learning networks. Social  Network Analysis (SNA) will be used as the primary method to  analyze these networks. SNA has emerged as a leading method  for studying online social interactions at an individual level and  group level, as well as for studying learning networks [7], [8],  [10], [11]. SNA seeks to represent datasets in the form of social  networks; where nodes represent group members and edges (or  ties) connect people by means of various types of relations. For  example, individual Twitter users may be viewed as nodes, and  the messages shared between them may be seen as edges. These  network representations of social interactions provide researchers  with an effective mechanism for studying collaborative processes  in learning communities, such as knowledge construction,  influence and support [1], [9], [16].   However, to study online communities using SNA, social  network data about connections among members of a particular  community needs to be collected. Until recently, capturing such  information has been resource-intensive and primarily done via  time-consuming and intrusive social network surveys  administered to network participants. The advantage of studying  learning communities that use a social media platform is that most  of their social interactions are recorded and can be used to study  the groups underlying social structures automatically. Once a  social network among group members is discovered, it can be  used to understand how group dynamics (e.g., active and outlier  participation) relate to learning, and how the formation of shared  norms and other social processes in online communities relates to  successful learning outcomes.   One of the reasons automated discovery of social networks is  currently an emerging area of research is that it tends to be  unobtrusive, scalable and fast. Automated network data collection  is also not encumbered with many of the difficulties related to  traditional qualitative data collection: i.e., respondents may  provide partial answers, exaggerate interactions, forget people, or  perceive events differently from other network participants (see  discussions by [14]).   With these difficulties in mind, this initiative focuses on new  ways of discovering online social networks automatically. In  particular, the panelists will discuss some of the common  automated approaches for social network discovery from social  media data, such as Twitter, blogs, social bookmarking data and  forums in the learning context (see, for example, [3], [4], [5], [6]).    4.

INTRODUCTION  Over the past decade learning analytics (LA) has become a bona  fide field.   Learning analytics has been explicitly listed in The  New Media Consortiums Horizon Report Higher Education  Edition for the past four years, with the 2014 edition reporting a  time to adoption of one year or less [3]. Various techniques  routinely used in learning analytics are listed on Gartners  Emerging Hype Cycle 2013, including:  quantified self;  prescriptive analytics; big data; content analytics; activity  streams; and, predictive analytics [2]. In 2013 big data, which,  for our purposes, we will construe as big educational data, has  reached the peak of inflated expectations on the hype cycle [2].  Despite significant data collection activity, the education sector  has been slow to adopt a strategic and systemic view of  analytics. It is envisaged that education systems that do make the  transition towards data-informed planning, decision making, and  teaching and learning will hold significant competitive  advantage and quality advantages over those who do not [12].  However, despite the explosion of learning analytics research,  most of what emerges in the field is course level, small scale, or  tool-centric approaches. While these efforts are vitally important  to the development of the field, in order to truly transform  education, LA must scale and become institutionalized at  multiple levels throughout an educational system. Identifying the  precise competitive advantages that analytics can bring to the  education sector is a multifaceted and complex undertaking.    In  short, LA practitioners must begin applying the wealth of  evidence-based research and processes to the everyday  operations of teaching and learning.   In order to achieve these  goals, institutions must invest significant resources and employ  systems-level thinking in order to grow institutional capacities.     2. FRAMING QUESTION FOR THE  PANEL DISCUSSION  While LA is concentrated on the education space (formal and  informal learning), a vast amount of past research exists in closely  aligned fields such as educational data mining, social network  analysis, learning and computer sciences, and many more that can  be applied to advance development. However, this is often  problematized as a result of disciplinary silos, skepticism and a  lack of acceptance and knowledge of analytics [6].     Using specific case studies, a panel of changes agents from the  University of Wisconsin System (UWS), the Society for Learning  Analytics Research organization, the University of New England   257    (UNE), and Rio Salado College (RSC) will discuss the grand  challenge   learning   analytics   is   currently   facing, specifically  focusing on the following overarching question:    What organizational capacities are necessary for successful  systematic adoption of learning analytics    While often a daunting task, these case studies demonstrate how  institutions have   managed to make significant in-roads in  system-level application of learning analytics by adopting a multi- pronged strategy focusing on the scalability, sustainability, and  diversification of organizational competencies.    3. ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY  FOR LEARNINGANALYTICS  Many have asserted the necessity of building organizational  capacity in learning analytics [5, 8, 9, 11], but limited attention  has been paid to the larger policy and strategy considerations that  influence the adoption and deployment of analytics in educational  settings. Fostering student success comes from many levels of an  organization and, thus, any strategy pertaining to student success  must involve multiple stakeholders and contributions. It should be  made clear that many systemic LA implementations to date have  centered on a perspective of analytics as a technology, as a tool,  and as a means to measure. Yet analytics like any other  technological system is complex and encapsulates the social and  cultural domains.  Pugliese presents five stages of student success  analytics: 1) technology infrastructure, analytics tools, and  applications; 2) policies, processes, practices, and workflows; 3)  values and skills; 4) culture and behavior; and 5) leadership [10].  These stages, combined with a compelling, multi-faceted    framework   for   optimized   student   success   through analytics  from Norris and Baer, have provided a foundation for  optimization of learning analytics at a systemic level [7]. In order  to achieve sufficient organizational capacity and demonstrate  institutional commitment, all five stages are ideally addressed  concurrently with appropriation of adequate human and non- human resources.     3.1 Technology Infrastructure, Analytics  Tools, and Applications  The technology infrastructure underlying analytics, as well as the  analytic tools and applications themselves, are fundamental  concerns when considering how to implement and deliver  learning analytics solutions, particularly at scale. While this  category is very broad, for the purposes of this panel we will  focus on underlying technical infrastructure and analytic tools.    3.1.1 Technical infrastructure  The technical infrastructure is a foundational element of any LA  initiative. The technical infrastructure allows for collection,  storage, transformation, and access to raw or processed data .and  must be implemented and managed in strict accordance with all  appropriate IT security and data privacy protocols, including any  relevant local, state and federal policies.  These important  considerations often exist in tension with the desire to explore and  innovate. However, establishing processes such as regular  monitoring of data intake, transformation and extract procedures,  as well as the overall health of analytics technical infrastructure  help ensure compliance. In addition it is important to regularly  subject the data to examination by subject-matter experts who can  provide validation of data integrity and to enable prompt  corrective action to proceed when appropriate.     3.1.2Analytics tools  Once stable and reliable infrastructure exists, it is important to  begin examining analytic tools. While analytic capabilities are  built into technical infrastructure, in the case of learning analytics,  there are a wide range of analytic tools that might supplement  existing analytics capability or enable additional analytic features.  Since analytic tools will need to meet the needs of a wide variety  of stakeholders, the decision to develop a new system  should go  through a rigorous requirement gathering and evaluation process.  Especially in the context of a systems level LA adoption in which  a move away from tool- centric application of learning analytics  may be considered, it is very possible that instead of supporting a  single tool, institutions opt for a diverse analytic tool chest.      3.2    Policies, Processes, Practices, and  Workflows   In order to build a sustainable, systemic level learning analytics  culture, policies, processes, practices, and workflows must be  considered along with policy and governance, logistical process  and project management, and budgetary and financial viability.    3.2.1 Policy and governance  Learning analytics often calls for different uses of existing data  and while these uses may be covered under existing institutional  policies, the emerging definition of data ownership and  stewardship may require additional new attention. Even with the  national discussions occurring around this topic, each institution  must broach this topic with the interests of its stakeholders in  mind. Given the complexity in extracting and interpreting data  from multiple pedagogical approaches it is understandable that  government and quality assurance agencies have limited the  variables to the more transferable, yet obtuse, measures such as  attrition, progression, and graduation rates.     While data policies are central to LA discussions, governance is  also important to think though at a systemic level.   There are  many levels of governance, but a structure that is likely not in  existence  currently  is  one  which  focuses  solely  on  the   forward movement of learning analytics.   Depending upon the  needs of an institution this may be a system wide steering  committee, a task force, or working groups.      3.2.2 Logistical process and project management  Due   to   the   complexities   of   the   technological and human  infrastructures required to build a system-wide approach to  learning analytics we have found that both system and campus- level project management are necessities.   The key areas are: (a)  tracking task completions, (b) development of processes and  workflow, (c) coordinating communication for key  deliverables   and  dates,  and  (d)  ensuring that the work that is conducted in  line with the overall directions set by the group.    3.2.3 Budgetary and financial viability  The initial funding for the UWS LA project was provided through  a UW System sponsored three year Growth Agenda Grant.    The  Grant has been essential in providing flexibility for the project  team to overcome challenges and explore opportunities that arise.  As a part of the grant, the necessary resources to scale   and    operationalize   learning analytics to   additional   system  campuses beyond the initial pilot campuses are being assessed to  assist with determining ongoing financial viability. UWS is in the  process of building preliminary estimates into a five year  operational budget plan. The initial funding for the UNE learning   258    analytics initiative was sponsored under a federal  funding grant  for courseware enhancement. Similar to the UWS project, long  term sustainability with operational budgets must be considered.    3.3 Values and skills  Puglieses category of values and skills is wide-reaching. Values  and skills are closely aligned so this section discusses data and  analytic expertise, evaluation and research competencies, and  teacher and learner support. A barrier to institution-wide adoption  pertains to not only a skills and capabilities shortage, but also a  lack of a common understanding of analytics in general and the  definitions associated with user and content generated data [12].     3.3.1 Data expertise  Successful implementation of a learning analytics initiative  requires involvement of course-level and institutional data experts  who understand how data are collected, where they are stored, and  what inferences can be reasonably drawn from them. Since  learning analytics often combine course-level interaction and  participation data from academic technologies with administrative  data from the institutions student information system (SIS), data  experts from both areas need to contribute to learning analytics  efforts. These staff understand what data are collected from which  students; reasons for missing or incomplete data; and already- known predictors of institutional and course outcomes that could  inform a learning analytics implementation.    In terms of predictive analytics, data experts who understand the  structure of the academic technologies, such as learning  management systems (LMS), are needed to develop and interpret  predictors of course success. These data experts need to work with  each course instructor to understand the structure of the course and  use of the technology within the course. It is important that the  data experts understand which elements of the technologies are  used by instructors in each course. Short of an institutional  repository for course meta-data, this requires a relationship  between the academic technology data expert and the course  instructor.    In addition to knowing what inferences can be made from existing  administrative data, data expertise and leadership is also needed to  inform new data collection efforts. Most administrative data are  collected for operational, compliance, or legally-mandated  reporting purposes. Although these data often prove useful in  predicting course and institutional outcomes, they are usually not  collected explicitly for learning analytics purposes. Collection of  new data elements for a LA effort incurs cost for staff time,  leadership of new implementation efforts, database updates and  maintenance, and training.    3.3.2Analyticexpertise  Depending on an institutions goals and objectives, learning  analytics relies heavily on analytic expertise. The development of  predictive models or adaptive algorithms, particularly those used  to make consequential decisions and recommend courses of action  to teachers or students, requires contributions from experts with  backgrounds in statistics, predictive analytics, learning sciences,  measurement,   and   data   visualization.      Analytic expertise is needed to develop and validate predictive  models; integrate, coordinate, and use data inputs from multiple  data systems; help interpret the meaning of significant predictive  variables as well as determine appropriate interventions based on   the strength of models; and develop data visualization tools and  other means of synthesizing data for mass consumption.    3.3.3 Evaluation and research competencies  In any learning analytics program a core competency that must be  considered is that of evaluation and research.  Evaluation is a key  skill when examining the progress of forward momentum.    Depending on the needs of certain constituents, outcome measures  may be very different and an experienced evaluator will be able to  map goals to outcomes so that informed decisions can be make.   While evaluation and research expertise may be found in the same  person, in some instances, there may be a distinct need for an  educational researcher with experience in learning analytics  research in order to assist in making iterative changes in process to  improve the learning analytics trajectory at an institution.      3.3.4 Teacher and learner support  Introducing the value of learning analytics to faculty and students  and getting their buy-in is a must for the success of any project. As  UWS approached learning analytics as a pilot project, pilot faculty  selection was based on their interest and willingness to experiment  with predictive data to identify at-risk student behaviors early in  the course. Faculty were scaffolded with personal consultations  and job aids support to:  critically assess the weekly predictions  they were given to predict at-risk students in their course; compare  other indicators they normally observe with the data offered by the  learning analytics system predictions; validate accuracy and assist  in refining the predictive models; and build data-driven  intervention strategies for their course. It is imperative that faculty  understand the predictive data and be able to interpret the results  with confidence.     Students also need a high level of support.   While the faculty  member or instructor has direct interaction with students in a  course, there is a high likelihood that additional support and  interaction as predictive data are made available to them. Students  need to be properly informed of how their data are being used, as  well as advised about the potential benefits/risks to them. This is  underscored by the need for data literacy among students. As the  analytics mature and students have direct access to analytics about  their learning behaviors, additional support will need in the form  of academic advising.    3.4 Culture and Behavior  The promise of educational technology to underpin and drive a  transformative learning experience will not be delivered through a  simple adoption process. This requires educators to revisit and  break the historical pedagogical, socio-cultural and economic  assumptions that can stifle education practice [6].  It is vitally  important that institutions examine these domains when trying to  target systems-level thinking about learning analytics as it will be  the bedrock of how any project is accepted.    3.4.1 Cultural framework for awareness and  acceptance  The cultural framework for awareness and acceptance for the  presence of learning analytics needs to be developed. Many myths  surrounding the use of data, privacy infringement and ownership  of data need to be dispelled and can be properly modulated once  the values of learning analytics are realized. Additionally, an  understanding that learning analytics take on different forms, and  serve different needs, take away the urge to champion one best  tool as multiple tools can co-exist and build on each other.  Partnership with faculty builds a trust relationship and diffuses the  suspicion they may hold against a specific tool.   259    At both UWS and UNE a major focus was put on awareness  workshops for the academic community to introduce the power of  learning analytics. Academic units were engaged early in the  planning and visioning process.  Ongoing conversations were  ensured total transparency in pilot projects, as well as encouraged  involvement. Community conversations often needed to highlight  potential transformation, but also needed to overlay a pragmatic  lens so that realistic expectations could be maintained. Overnight  success and silver bullet solutions in the realm of learning  analytics is highly unlikely. Generally, it is vital to deliver a  message of persistence and dedication that, in time, will hopefully  yield meaningful results.      3.5 Leadership  While addressed last in this article, committed leadership is vital to  any attempt to launch a new program at both campus- and system-  wide scale.  Key pedagogical questions must be the drivers rather  than tools or perceived technical limitations. In addition, if an  institution hopes to institutionalize LA over time, new leadership  must be cultivated for the future of overall capacity building. Early  successes from the case studies presented during the panel and  others can be used to guide activity in other systems.     3.5.1 Strategic thinking and leadership  In the case of the UWS LA initiative, leadership was vital at  multiple levels.   In general, we followed Kotters eight- step  model of leadership: 1) establishing a sense of urgency; 2)  creating a guiding coalition; 3) developing a change vision; 4)  communicating the vision for buy-in; 5) empowering broad- based action; 6) generating short-term wins; 7) never letting up;  and 8) incorporating the changes into the institutional culture [4].  For the statewide system, budget and project managers were  critical to overall project coordination, budgeting and  interactions with the commercial analytics software provider.    Each participating campus also had a principal investigator (PI)  to locally manage grant reporting and interactions with the  institutional review boards and campus data custodians.   On the  technology side, an overall project manager coordinated  communications internally with project participants and  instructors, and externally to the greater campus communities.    Absolutely vital to success was having a leader with a deep  scholarly understanding of learning analytics principles and  practices and the mechanics of creating predictive models.        Finally, beyond individual leadership roles, learning analytics  initiatives will benefit from coordination of leadership from  across the institution. Strong leadership is essential in facilitating  intra- and cross-campus communication, problem solving and  strategic planning.       4. CONCLUSION  Many university systems are at the stage of small scale analytics  projects to develop recommender systems, predictive models,  and attributes and profiles of successful students. The lack of  enterprise models has been noted by Susan Grajek Vice  President for Data, Research, and Analytics at EDUCAUSE, in  lamenting the lack of broad scale impact that analytics has made  to date: We havent figured out how to put analytics to work  pervasively throughout higher education to make a difference  and resolve our most pressing issues [1].    This panel presentation focuses on the importance of building  institutional   capacity   for   system-level   implementation   of  learning analytics.   The emphasis is on using the existing   research and theory as the foundation to begin building out new  theory and research in system level thinking to support learning  analytics. No institution will achieve a system level application  of learning analytics by accident, intentional planning must occur  that focuses on the emergent and iterative nature of  organizational change in learning analytics. The nuanced views  of the cross-functional panel will shine unique perspectives on  the five stages of Puglieses student success analytics.    5.

INTRODUCTION  One of the most crucial distinctions between Chinese and Western  languages is that the former is based on ideograms, whereas the  latter is based on phonograms. Intermediate to advanced learners  of an ideographic language (i.e., Chinese) are often able to deduce  that the character is a type of fish, and that the character is  pronounced as fang, even if he or she never learned this specific  character before. He or she is also aware that the radical part  can only be located on the left hand side of the ideogram, and the  phonetic partcan only be located on the right hand side. In  other words, he or she has developed an intuition as to where  radicals and phonetics should be located. For many learners,  identifying and utilizing such patterns can be powerful in learning  Chinese more effectively.

For many  learners who are not Chinese native speakers, writing Chinese is  often even more challenging than recognition. To address this  issue, we developed a Chinese character (HanZi) writing learning  platform with automatic feedback. This system, called Xue-Wen  Easy Go!, intends to take advantage of the current advances in  mobile devices and learning analytics to collect learners  handwritten Chinese characters. This collection would inform the  design of learning and teaching strategies to improve learning  effectiveness.   2. OVERVIEW OF THE HANZI  LEARNING PLATFORM  In the digital era, learners are able to learn a language anytime and  anywhere. To effectively learn Chinese, computer assisted  learning systems with interactive and real time automatic  feedback features can be especially beneficial. The following  Chinese learning platform, Xue-Wen Easy Go!, takes two issues  into consideration, namely (1) a multimedia learning environment,  and (2) an automatic feedback mechanism with data collection.  The system records the learners inputs (i.e., handwritten Chinese  characters) for further analysis, effectively eliminating the need  for a camera recording process which requires more manpower  and time.  The system consists of three main mechanisms: (1)  data collection, which includes learner login, handwriting display,  handwriting practice, and automatic feedback; (2) data filtering  and analysis; and (3) the design of learning and teaching strategies  based on the results of (2).   3. HANZI HANDWRITING ACQUISITION  The designed Xue-Wen Easy Go! client runs on MS Windows XP  and Windows 7 operating systems.  It consists of 5,000 popular  Chinese characters, both in traditional and simplified forms.      3.1 Characters and Strokes Display  The system supports the four most common types of Chinese  query inputs: pinyin, bo-po-mo (), radical, and stroke count.  Characters that have the same radical or homophone appear in the  auxiliary area so that learners can choose the character they would  like practice. The display function supports stroke display in  sequence mode and radical display mode as shown in Figure 1.  Pause and replay functions are included in the system. The  combination of these functions enables learners to effectively  build on their knowledge of character radicals.   (https://youtu.be/La-scFai6qE)   261       3.2 Chinese Handwriting Practice and  Automatic Feedback  In learning an ideographic language, repeated character writing is  beneficial to character recognition and memory. As a result,  Xue-Wen Easy Go! is designed with a handwriting practice area,  as shown in Figure 2. After the system is installed, learners  practice writing characters using an electronic pen on a tablet, just  as they would traditionally practice using a ballpoint pen on paper.  Our system supports three modes of handwriting practice: (1)  basic mode, which guides the learner stroke-by-stroke through the  character; (2) intermediate mode, which guides the learner  radical-by-radical through the character; and (3) advanced mode,  which does not present any guides. Hence, both teachers and  learners have the flexibility to select the most appropriate mode at  any point in the learning / teaching process.    The automatic feedback is a special design which consists of the  following features:   (1) Error feedback: Common errors that can be automatically  detected include errors in stroke sequence, stroke direction,  stroke junction, missing strokes, and extra strokes; automatic  feedback is available to learners   (2) Character neatness evaluation and feedback:  The neatness  of a handwritten character, computed using the distance  between the character centroid and the radical centroids, can  be evaluated; automatic feedback is available to learners   (3) Overall evaluation:  The overall score is broken down into 5  levels (1~5). The final score takes stroke correctness and  character neatness into consideration   (4) Time tags: Records the total time of the handwriting process                                    4. The EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN  Before the collection of HanZi characters on a massive scale, we  conducted a pilot study to refine the designed system. Participants  included 160 U.S. college students in their first year as Chinese  learners. The students were assigned HanZi handwriting and  recognition homework. The handwritten samples (i.e., characters)  were collected once a week. Traditionally, it would have been  difficult and time-consuming to analyze each character  one-by-one, but by using Xue-Wen Easy Go!, we were able to  collect handwritten characters quickly, and with dynamic  playback of each individual character, as shown in Figure 3.Each  handwritten sample is accompanied with data including time tags,  character scores, error patterns, and learner IDs (Figure 4). Using  this information, we can effectively analyze error patterns and  design improved learning and teaching strategies for each learner,  as well as teachers. Learners are also able to proactively retrieve  their handwritten characters from the system to review and make  corrections. A detailed view of the above processes is shown in  the following video clip, http://youtu.be/MlJbF2T1rkA.      Figure 3  Dynamic playback for the character       5. CONCLUSIONS  A Chinese handwriting environment called Xue-Wen Easy Go!  was designed and described in this paper. The system includes  several technologically enhanced features which allow us to  automatically acquire handwritten samples and provide interactive  feedback for learners. We also performed a pilot study which  enabled us to improve the developed HanZi handwriting tools. At  present, we are in the position to design a web-based HanZi  learning environment to collect handwriting samples on a more  massive scale for further learning analysis.   6.

INTRODUCTION  Knowledge discovered through educational data mining is used  not only to provide feedback to learners, but also to help  instructors to manage their classes, understand their students  learning processes, and reflect on their own teaching [1-4]   Several Educational Data Mining studies of student behavior in  online and other educational tools revealed differences between  groups of students in terms of such variables as level of  participation in discussion boards [5], Questions & Answers  boards, completion of assignments, and annotations [5-7]. Each of  these studies has helped to validate these techniques as methods  of identifying pedagogically interesting cohorts of students based   on their activity with educational technologies.     Figure 1 offers a schematic of the flow in many large survey  courses.  Before the semester begins the instructor might offer a  reading or video that illustrates points to be discussed in class.  In  class the instructor will present content and optionally ask  questions of the students to assess their understanding and/or  invite discussion.  Following that class the instructor may offer  homework, assign readings or video recordings that either review  material covered or prepare for the next class session.  This cycle  continues until a test or quiz is given which often triggers  summative review by the students.   The dual challenge of providing a solid discipline foundation for  STEM majors and creating understanding and engagement for  non-STEM majors requires a commitment by both groups to   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Unfortunately few  STEM instructors really know how their students behave either in  or outside the classroom so offering meaningful guidance about  desired study habits is often based on self-reported information  from the student who may be reluctant to be totally honest about  their effort, especially before they receive their final grades.   Moreover, an instructors advice to students is often informed by  their experience as a student and may not represent the best  advice for students from a different generation and a different set  of background skills and motivations. The end result is that  introductory STEM instructors are limited to a post-hoc analysis  of student learning challenges, and often advise students without  understanding the particular circumstances students are in or goals  that they have.   What if, on the other hand, the instructor had an objective and  detailed view of each students behavior with course material as  the course was being taught  If the instructor could understand  such a mass of data, they could tailor course content, reviews,  interactive sessions, assignments, and exams to the needs and  desires of the student body. Taking advantage of real-time access  to this data, instructors could identify meaningful cohorts based  on behavior, researching variability within a cohort to identify  factors contributing to poor outcomes, and make actionable  teaching activities aimed at strengthening student learning. To  make such a task tractable, an instructor would need high fidelity  (and pedagogically relevant) student-computer interaction data, a  tool or methods by which to summarize this data quickly and  effectively, and flexible course delivery that allowed for near real- time adjustment of pedagogical techniques.   LectureTools records a unique and broad spectrum of on-line  student activities during and outside classes, including:   1. Notes written on a per student per slide basis as the lecture is  delivered (students can opt out if they wish),   2. Student responses to instructor questions on a per student per  question basis,   3. Correctness of student answers (when appropriate)  4. Student bookmarking of slides as important or confusing,  5. Student annotations on slides, and  6. Questions posed by students to their instructor.      Together, these technologies cover many of the typical learning  tasks described in Figure 1 and offer a database of activities that  can be compared with learning outcomes to try to identify  relationships.   2. Study Guides   One initial outcome of this research has been the generation of  student study guides based on the mining of students notes.  Note  are sniffed in real-time and word clouds (called Lecture  Clouds) are created with greater weight given to a list of  keywords defined by the instructor.  After class students can view  the Lecture Clouds summarized by lecture or by slide within a  lecture.   3. Thoughts   This work illustrates that tools designed to be integral to class  conduct can, in fact, increase students perceptions of engagement   positively.  When students are given the opportunity tom  participate in class, and especially large survey courses, they will.   The key here is providing tools that give instructors more  opportunities to involve students actively in class through  challenging questions and responding to student questions. The  work on mining the data from this system is still in its infancy.   Students have anecdotally, warmly received the creation of study  guides based on student note taking.  They are particularly  interested in having the words linked to resources that challenge  their understanding on the concept.  To this end the system was  expanded to link words to the page in their eTextbook that is best  matched to the concept.   It remains a challenge to demonstrate whether these interventions  have led to deeper student learning.  The variation in student  outcomes, as measured by grades, are due to many factors that  make it difficult to identify the effect of a specific tool.   Continued research will cluster students who participate in class  in the same way to see if variations within a cohort of similar  students can allow a firmer understanding of the impact of  specific interventions.   4.

The XIP Dashboard is a  set of visual analytics modules based on the XIP output. In this  paper, we briefly introduce the XIP technology and demonstrate  an example visualisation of the XIP Dashboard.   1. INTRODUCTION  As literatures expand and fields become increasingly  multidisciplinary, it is common for researchers to find  themselves navigating papers produced in a variety of research  fields; some of which are written according to norms and  conventions that are different from those of their home  disciplines. When engaging with this literature, a core  competency is a critical mind, which includes an ability to  identify when significant claims and arguments are being made  in articles. The ability to decode such moves in texts is essential,  as is the ability to make such moves in ones own writing. For  this reason, we are interested in analytics tools which help  readers to make sense of the scholarly, and which provide  feedback to writers, ranging from students to experienced  researchers, on the quality of their own writing.   Research into academic writing draws attention to the question  of whether or not there are universal conventions for such  scholarly moves (see [1, 2] for example studies). Literature  shows that scholarly articles have typical argument structures  regardless of their discipline. Therefore, while engaging with  the literature; researchers make use of specific linguistic cues in  the text. These are referred to technically as metadiscourse  markers. Metadiscourse is an important element of a document.  It allows readers to make sense of a text; understand viewpoints,  arguments and claims; thus engaging with the authors intended  meaning [3]. Authors signal argumentative moves by using  well-established patterns known as metadiscourse markers.  Such elements inside the text are discipline-independent clear  forms that are actually identifiable. However, identifying these   can be challenging for literature reviewers.   Although identifying such argumentative elements within the  documents can be challenging for the human readers,  metadiscourse markers can be automatically identified. An  increasing number of electronic publications through electronic  library databases has prompted an increase in research and  development in the field of machine processing. Research into  this field has been providing more effective ways of navigating  the literature and helping readers to engage with ideas. And  work in natural language processing (NLP) technology has  made it possible to detect metadiscourse markers  automatically.  In this paper we will introduce an NLP tool, called Xerox  Incremental Parser (XIP). XIPs discourse analysis module  identifies rhetorically salient sentences on the basis of the  metadiscourse markers. We, then demonstrate the XIP  dashboard, which builds on the XIP output. It is designed to  help readers to make sense of the scholarly papers more rapidly  and conveniently; and to assess the current state of the art in  terms of trends, patterns, gaps and connections.   2. XEROX INCREMENTAL PARSER   Xerox Incremental Parser (XIP) is an NLP tool which carries  out automated metadiscourse analysis of scholarly text  documents. It aims at highlighting the main research issues that  the article handles. The idea behind the tool is that rhetorical  moves can be detected from the authors language use [4].  Therefore, XIP highlights metadiscourse that conveys the  authors rhetorical strategy and labels the rhetorical functions  such as: summary, background knowledge, contrasting ideas,  novelty, surprising idea, and open question. For example, in the  following paragraph of text (Figure 1), XIP extracted two salient  sentences (highlighted in yellow) and identified rhetorical type  of these sentences (as Novelty and Contrast) on the basis of the  metadiscourse markers (shown in red). In addition, XIP  identifies concepts (nouns and noun phrases) within rhetorically  salient sentences, which indicate the topics dealt with by the  sentence (underlined in the Figure 1).  XIPs raw output is a semantically tagged file suitable for  subsequent machine analysis. While such plain textual output is  well suited for researchers to analyse manually, or with other  tools, this is not a form which could be usefully or attractively  presented back to either learners, educators seeking to assess  their progress, or to other kinds of information analyst for whom  this work is relevant. Therefore the XIP Dashboard, a visual  analytics on XIP output, has been implemented to solve this  problem.

THE XIP DASHBOARD  The XIP dashboard has three parts, each of which visualises the  XIP output in a different way. This paper illustrates one  example visualisation (Figure 2), for other visualisations and  detailed information please see the demo video and our previous  paper [5]. As shown in Figure 2, the XIP dashboard consists of a  bubble chart which displays the occurrence of scholarly papers  on specific topics, filtered by user-selected concepts. As shown  by the colour spectrum at the top, saturation represents the total  number of papers mentioning the selected concepts as salient  (the darker the bubble, the higher the number of papers); and  while the size of the bubble represents the density of the  concept in the paper based on the number of XIP classified  sentences in which it occurs (the bigger the bubble, the denser  the use of the concept). When a user mouse overs a concept  bubble, it displays a pie chart showing the relative distribution  of rhetorical types. For example, it could display the total  number of contrasting idea statements made in relation to the  selected concept within papers. When a user selects a segment  of the pie, these sentences are listed. This then enables users to  see the full paper that mentions the selected sentence with all  other highlighted salient sentences within the paper.   In the conference demo, we will be showing the XIP Dashboard  visualisations with a specific test corpus. The dataset we will be  using is the Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) dataset.  This dataset is published by the Society for Learning Analytics  Research (SoLAR) [6]. Prior to implementation of the XIP  Dashboard, the LAK Dataset papers were analysed through XIP.  This produced a semantically tagged output file of each paper  for subsequent machine analysis. Output files were then  imported into a relational MySQL database and the user  interface was implemented using PHP and JavaScript, making  use of Google Chart Tools for the interactive visualisations.  Current version of the XIP dashboard is built from locally stored   data. All the LAK dataset papers were rendered by the XIP  tools developers, who then shared the output files with us. By  the time of the LAK 14 conference, we plan to be able to build  an architecture where XIP can be called as a web service.  Therefore in the conference demo, the XIP dashboard will be  accessing XIP services remotely through its API.   4. CONCLUSION  Authors use specific discipline-independent argumentative  patterns, called metadiscourse markers. These help readers to  identify significant claims and arguments made by the authors.  However the identification of such patterns can be difficult for  the human readers. As computational techniques are maturing,  NLP tools are becoming available to automatically identify  these markers. However the results are not very user-friendly.  The XIP Dashboard has been implemented to address these  problems and provide user-friendly visual analytics of academic  writing. In the LAK 14 conference demo session, we will  demonstrate the different types of visualisations offered by the  XIP dashboard on a specific test corpus (LAK dataset). In the  live demo, we will also be explaining how the XIP dashboard  can be used to improve the quality of the academic writing  process. The current version of the XIP dashboard restricts itself  with enabling its users to make sense of the published literature.  Our longer term goal is using the XIP Dashboard as a formative  assessment tool for ones own writing, in which users will get  visual analytics results of their own contributions.   5.

INTRODUCTION         The Open Academic Analytics Initiative (OAAI) was a two-  year project supported by the EDUCAUSE Next Generation   Learning Challenges (NGLC) program, funded primarily by the   Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The 2 major goals involved   during the project were: (a) develop and deploy an open-source   academic early-alert system and (b) research the portability of the   predictive analytics models across all of higher education. An   initial predictive model was developed by analyzing historical   student data collected from Marist College, a four-year private   liberal arts college. The model was released under a Creative   Commons License using open source XML-based standard called   Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML). The model was   then deployed at 4 partner institutions, 2 community colleges and 2   Historical Black Colleges and Universities, as means to predict,   early in the semester, which students were at academic risk to not   complete their course successfully.  The identified were provided   with intervention strategies developed in an effort to impact student   academic performance in the course. A detailed effectiveness study   was performed to deduce the intervention strategies used and also   the portability factors of the predictive model, when the models   were deployed at institutions with significantly different academic   context (e.g. student population, course size, institution type), as   compared to Marist, where the model was originally developed.    2. EARLY ALERT SYSTEM OVERVIEW         Figure 1 depicts a brief overview of the OAAI academic alert   system. Four datasets were extracted from two major sources: (1)   Student Information System (SIS) consisting of: (a) student   demographic and aptitude data; (b) course grades and course related   data; (2) Sakai, an enterprise level open source Learning   Management System (LMS) consisting of: (c) student interaction   data generated in the course; (d) Students scores on specific  gradebook items in the grading rubric like assignments, exams etc.    Figure 1: OAAI Academic Alert System Overview          The OAAI research uses an open source business analytics   platform called Pentaho Business Intelligence suite, as its core   technology, and leverages its advanced data integration and data   mining capabilities. Predictive models were developed, verified &   validated using WEKA, Pentahos data mining module and IBM  SPSS Modeler, and tested for compatibility with other data mining   tools. Pentaho Kettle (the data integration component) was used to   transform the extractions and load it into the predictive modelling   stages of the project. Finally Pentaho Report Designer (PRD) tool   was used to generate course specific, simple, pixel perfect   Academic Alert Reports (AAR), containing the details of potential   students at academic risk as classified by the predictive models.          The paper will focus on a prototype demonstration of data   processing and predictive analysis aspects employed in the scope   of the research. The demonstration is divided into 2 categories: (1)   developing the open source academic alert model; (2) deploying the   academic alert system. The paper will conclude with a brief   overview of the future research plans.       3. BUILDING AN EARLY ALERT MODEL        This stage involves training the predictive models by analyzing  the historical data collected at Marist College. The demonstration   involves two steps, Data integration & Predictive modelling.

LAK '14, Mar 24-28 2014, Indianapolis, IN, USA   ACM 978-1-4503-2664-3/14/03.    http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567574.2567578   267  http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567574.2567578   3.1 Data Integration        The data mining processes is largely dependent on the quality  of the input data and the predictive models are only as good as its   training data [1]. The data integration process ensures data quality   enhancements that are crucial for a successful data mining process.         The Marist student data of worth 3 semesters (Fall 2010, 2011  & Spring 2011) were extracted from Sakai LMS and Banner SIS.   The 4 sources of datasets defined earlier were extracted, for each of   the semester, into a local data repository (SQL Server 2008).   Pentaho Kettle, a flow based Extraction Transformation Load   (ETL) programming tool was used to perform the data integration.    Kettle provides a rich set of data manipulation plug-ins & filters to   perform various ETL operations. The data manipulation process   can be packaged into a series of reusable jobs and transformations,   scheduled to run at various intervals, thereby streamlining the data   integration process. Kettle also supports variety of standard   input/output formats to export the final ETL outcomes.        The extraction process was followed by a data transformation   and clean-up process to enrich the data quality. The data variables   were recoded as necessary, re-scaled, transformed, and handled for   missing values and outliers. Various table join operations were   formed to create a single large integrated dataset consisting of   unique student-course record combination augmented with related   data from all the 4 source files. Variability issues arising due to   differences in Sakai tools usage and student grades assessment   criteria by the instructors across courses were handled using   statistical computing approaches [1]. The ACADEMIC_RISK   (target class variable) threshold criteria was defined in historical   Marist data by categorizing the students who secured grades C or   above as at good standing and those who secured below C grade as   at academic risk. The resulting data was later loaded into the   Predictive modelling stages to train and test the academic alert   models. Please refer [1] [2] for more details regarding the dataset   fields, recoding, transformation and derivation of predictors.     3.2 Predictive Modelling         The demonstration of predictive modelling stages include   additional data pre-processing stages before feeding the data into   the supervised machine learning algorithms to train predictive   models. The stages involved are as follows:           Partitioning Data: The consolidated datasets from the data   integration stages were partitioned to efficiently train, test and   validate the predictive models. The two partitions were: (a) training   data consisting of 2 semesters worth of data after data integration;  (b) one semester worth of data reserved for testing and validation.           Balancing Training data: The training data is usually   unbalanced in nature, as the at-risk population at Marist is very   small when compared to those in good standing. This data   imbalance, if not handled, creates a bias while training predictive   models. Hence, the minority class is balanced using oversampling   (SMOTE) & sub-sampling (Resample) filters provided by WEKA.   However, the integrity of the testing data is kept intact in this phase.          Training Predictive models & Evaluation: The balanced   training & testing datasets containing the pre-selected predictors   are fed into supervised machine learning processes like logistic   regression, support vector machines (SVM) and C4.5 decision tree   algorithms. These powerful discriminatory models learn patterns   for academic risk by analyzing the training data, and then identify   the students at risk in the testing data. The predicted outcomes from   the various trained models are compared against the actual   academic risk outcomes to determine the prediction performance of   the model. The WEKA output yields a confusion matrix which can   be used to calculate prediction potency metrics such as accuracy,   recall, false positive rates and precision. Suitable, validated, best fit   models demonstrating sufficient potency measures are saved and a   library of models are created and stored for scoring incoming   student data. These models are then exported in standard PMML or   WEKA specific formats. See [1] [2] for details regarding modelling   algorithms, evaluations and software platforms used by the OAAI.   4. EARLY ALERT SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT         The deployment stages leverage the alert models built to score   the new incoming student-course datasets that need to be classified,   in order to identify the student population which is at academic risk.   There are 3 stages involved: data integration, scoring & reporting.          The data integration stages reuse the ETL flows from the model   building stages to transform the data extracted, derive the required   predictors and prepare the scoring dataset. A suitable predictive   model is selected from the library of predictive models and is   embedded within the Kettle transformation flow using the WEKA   scoring plugin. The incoming dataset is fed to the trained predictive   model and correlations are found by analyzing the supplied   predictors to identify the students at academic risk. The model   classified outcomes contains a probability score of a student   passing and failing in a course, which can be attributed to the   models confidence in the prediction. The probabilities are used to   further categorize the students into academic risk confidence levels   (HIGH, MEDIUM & LOW).           The predictions can be exported as JSON, XML, Excel, CSV,   database table formats using Kettle for more interactive reporting.   Pentaho Report Designer (PRD) framework is used to create   reporting templates that can be embedded within the Kettle flows.   OAAI currently uses simple excel output report templates   containing the list of students who are classified as at academic risk.   The report is then shared with the faculty to devise suitable   intervention strategies. Refer [1] [2] [3] for in-depth research   findings, detailing the model results and portability factors.   5. FUTURE RESEARCH INTERESTS         The paper outlines the underlying research methodologies and    design strategies in building and deploying the early alert academic   predictive models, on an open source platform through OAAI,   using real world datasets from Marist college and its partner   institutions. The portability results have been promising and our   next focus is on large scale operationalization of the research, by   providing vendor agnostic packaging of the early alert models   ensuring easy integration with the existing LMSs in the market.     6.

INTRODUCTION  Learning analytics based on educational big-data mining is an  emerging trend in the field of higher education. Whenever  students utilize the Internet, computers, or Learning Management  System (LMS), many log files are recorded.

This systematic process,  which includes data collection-analysis, achievement prediction,  and intervention treatment is called learning analytics. For  instance, Purdues Course Signals Model includes four  components, which are as follows: a) academic performance in  course, b) interaction with Learning Management System (LMS),  c) prior academic data such as high school GPA and SAT score,  and d) student characteristics such as age or residency [2].    However, three categories except b) are all about exogenous  variables which are powerful predictor variables, but are not  controllable by educators during instructions. Prior academic data  and student characteristics cannot be changed by students efforts  [1] although they are a significant factor for learning outcomes.    From the perspective of constructivism which is one of the  fundamental theories for educational technology, learning is a  self-developing process by creating or reorganizing a concept or  cognitive structure with learners experience or beliefs [3]. For  this reason, it is important to provide precautionary interventions  for individual learners to support their learning process.  Therefore, this study determines which controllable components  need to be included in learning analytics to help learners  improving their learning achievement continuously through an  educational technology approach.   2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS  Do the six suggested independent variables (IV1: Total login  frequency in LMS, IV2: Total studying time in LMS, IV3:  regularity of learning interval in LMS, IV4: Number of  downloads, IV5: Interactions with peers, and IV6: Interactions  with instructor) predict learners academic achievement   3. METHODS  3.1 Research Context  The participants in this study were 84 undergraduate students in a  face-to-face course entitled Understanding of Science of Public  Administration. This course had the following features: a) a three  credit core course for undergraduate students in the department of  Science of Public Administration, b) the instructor taught this  course during spring semester 2013 for 16 weeks, c) 20% of the  final grade was assigned for online discussion participation in  LMS, and d) students use LMS to download course materials,   269    including syllabus or assigned readings. All participants are  female students since this is a womens university.   3.2 Data Collection  Web-log data were collected from the Moodle-based Learning  Management System (LMS), and the independent variables for  this study, as shown in Table 1, were computed by automatic data  collection module embedded in the LMS. Final grades were  collected as a dependent variable in this study. Data matching  process between independent variables and final grades was  executed automatically in the database system.   Table 1. Data collecting methods for independent variables   Number Independent  variables   Data collecting   methods   IV1 Total login  frequency in LMS    Adding up the number of  individual students login  time into the LMS    IV2 Total studying  time in LMS   Calculating the total amount  of time spent between login  and logout   IV3 Regularity of  learning interval  in LMS   Calculating the standard  deviation of average login  time into the LMS   IV4 Number of  downloads   Adding up the numbers of  course materials downloaded    IV5 Interactions with  peers   Counting the total number of  students postings responding  to peers   IV6 Interactions with  instructor    Counting the total number of  students postings responding  to instructor   4. RESULTS  Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to develop a  model for predicting students academic achievement based on  their total studying time in LMS, total login frequency in LMS,  (ir)regularity of learning interval in LMS, interactions with  instructor, interactions with peers, and interactions with content.  Results are shown in Table 2.  The six-predictor model was able to account for 33.5% of the  variance in final grade, F(6, 77) = 6.457, p < .05, R2 = .335. Total  studying time in LMS and interaction with peers had a significant  (p < .05) correlation with final grade. In addition, (ir)regularity of  learning interval in LMS and number of downloads had  significant (p <. 10) partial effects in the full model. However,  total login frequency in LMS (=-.131, t=-.980, p > .05) and  interaction with instructor (=-.035, t=-.344, p > .05) did not  predict final grade.   5. CONCLUSION  The purpose of this study is to suggest more meaningful  components for learning analytics to help learners improving their  learning achievement continuously in terms of educational  technology approach. The regression model with only controllable  variables that can be affected by learners effort was able to  account for 33.5% of the variance in students academic  achievement. The main focus of learning analytics tends to focus   on the prediction of the future learning outcome by adding  geographical, demographical, or characteristic factors such as  high school GPA, SAT score, age, or residency.    Table 2. Results of multiple linear regression analysis   a. Dependent Variable: Final grade   However, these factors are not controllable because they were  fixed in the past and given to the instructional setting. Therefore,  based on the results of this study, we tested six controllable  variables for our learning analytics model and confirmed that four  of them were significantly correlated with learning final grade.  Moreover, these four variables not only predict learning outcomes  significantly but also can be changed if learners put more effort to  improve their academic performance. The advantage of learning  analytics using big-data mining is to predict students future  performance. Yet educators should pay more attention to  improving the process of learners achievement rather than  predicting achievement. However, this study was conducted with  a face-to-face course in a womens university in South Korea. In  addition, attendance rate, assignments and assessment composite,  and discussion composite were not added as independent  variables for this study because of the research context. Thus,  more research should be implemented using various course  subjects, different learning environments, and diverse participants  with different school settings, ages, sex, nationalities, and level of  student-instructor interactions.   6.

INTRODUCTION Online discussion platforms have been widely applied to  support collaborative learning from K-12 to tertiary educa- tion. As the usage has grown, so has the need for effective tools to interpret and facilitate online discussion. In this area has emerged a rich body of leaning analytics research that turns online discourse data into insights about collab- orative learning. A variety of tools have since been devel- oped to tackle important aspects of online discourse, ranging from social interactions to temporal patterns [1, 3]. Among these studies, analysis of textual information has been a con- stant focus, as written language dominates communication in most online dialogues.

Combined with visualiza- tion techniques, patterns revealed by text mining could be used to re-present online discussion in meaningful ways to promote collaboration and reflection [4].  Research of Knowledge Building (KB), a social construc- tivist pedagogy engaging learners to collectively advance knowledge through communal discourse [8], has maintained a long-standing interest in analyzing online discussion. Knowl- edge Forum [7], the most widely used KB environment, is implemented with a suite of assessment tools to interpret and facilitate KB discourse [10]. Because of KBs emphasis on communal discourse, the evolution of public community knowledge has been a key concern of KB analytics. The major analytic questions in this area include: What is the state of community knowledge Is the discourse effective in advancing knowledge Where is the community discourse heading The present study represents a recent experimen- tation to analytically tackle these questions. Applying topic modeling and visualization techniques, it attempts to ex- plore meaningful ways to represent online discourse to pro- mote reflection and metadiscourse. Results will contribute to an ongoing Knowledge Forum rebuild with new means of representing knowledge to facilitate idea improvement.  2. SUMMARY OF PRELIMINARY RESULTS Building on prior work, the present study aims to apply  text mining and visualization techniques to achieve the fol- lowing goals: (1) to model semantic space of KB discourse focusing on its emergent topics or discussion themes, (2) to visualize interpreted semantic space and inspect roles of different variables (e.g., time, students, and views) in KB discourse, and (3) to track student participation in different discussion themes over time.  To achieve these goals, I experimented with a range of techniques using a well-documented Knowledge Forum dataset. This dataset was produced by a Grade 4 class when they were studying a science unit Light. This dataset contains 308 notes from six views,1 with names such as How Light Travels,Colours of Light, and Shadows.  To achieve the first goal of modeling semantic space, La- tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a probabilistic topic-modeling technique [2], was applied on this dataset. A list of topics were identified, turning discourse into a high-dimensional semantic space represented by topics. For each topic, its  1In Knowledge Forum, students post ideas to their commu- nity in the form of notes, which can be conceptually orga- nized in a view to serve idea improvement.  271    Figure 1: Visualizing notes by topics and views.  probabilistic associations with terms are computed, mak- ing it possible for interpretation. For example, one topic was mostly associated with word stemsmirror, look, angl, and bouncand so was clearly about reflection. At the same time, each notes probabilistic memberships of topics were also calculated, so popularity of a topic could be approximated by the count of associated notes.  To visually represent topic modeling results, I further re- duce the modeled high-dimensional space into two dimen- sions. Locally Linear Embedding, which is thought to be su- perior to multidimensional scaling [6], was applied to achieve this goal. Notes could then be visualized by different vari- ables, such as topics, views, timestamps, and students, to explore usefulness of different visualizations. For instance, Figure 1 maps notes by topics and views. Given further assistance with interpretation, users could use this visual- ization to identify interested topics in each view and con- nect semantically related but physically isolated ideas across views.  Finally, I applied time series analysis to trace develop- ment of topics. By tracking participation in each topic across time, knowledge development of different topics becomes vis- ible. Figure 2 presents the results of the top five topics. Ac- cording to this figure, different topics had their rises and falls. For example, the beginning of the discourse mostly focused on how light travels, while refraction and re- flection dominated the end. Sources of light and light and materials were discussed throughout the unit, while the other three topics had their own golden times.  In summary, the present study seeks to advance current learning analytics of online discourse by providing new means of interpreting and visualizing knowledge. It will inform de- velopment of new Knowledge Forum analytic tools empha- sizing development of community knowledge.

INTRODUCTION  While students learn, explore, fail or procrastinate in a Learning  Management System (LMS) leave traces [1]. Nowadays, one of  the most commonly used LMS in higher educational contexts is  Moodle (modular object oriented developmental learning  environment). Moodle automatically records a vast amount of  information in the so-called logs, which is valuable for analyzing  students behavior. However, due to the vast quantity of data is  very difficult to manage them manually. The eGraph tool is  designed to assess participation and learning process of the  students in Moodle in a fast and simple way, which otherwise  would not be possible by the characteristics of the data (amounts  of raw data with no sense if are not processed) and the eTeaching- eLearnig Process itself (most of the times, the teacher has no  technical knowledge apart from the basic user interaction with the  system).   2. OBJECTIVES  -Provide a specific tool allowing educators to thoroughly track  and assess learners activities while evaluating the effectiveness of  the course contents for the learning process.    -Facilitate course adaptation and learning recommendations based  on students learning behaviors and Adaptive Educational  Hypermedia [2].    -Provide feedback to both teachers and students of eLearning  courses, and detection of atypical or non-adaptive learning  behaviors.    3. PROCEDURE  The tool has been developed in five phases as suggested in other  works [3].   3.1 Collect data  The Content Management System is used by students and the logs  are stored in the database. Particularly, to develop and test this  tool it has been used the data available from 576 third-year  graduate students from the University of Oviedo during a 13  weeks eLearning course.   3.2 Preprocessing data and setting variables  of interest  For this particular course we have chosen two main groups of  variables, but they can be easily changed according to the  teacher/researchers goals:   -Variables represented as different color nodes regarding course  contents. Seven different variables were selected: theoretical  content view, summary view, multimedia content view, task view,  task submission, forum view, and forum participation. Different  colors were assigned to each variable to facilitate their  visualization. The nodes are numbered by chronological order.  -Variables represented as edges regarding time between different  actions and activation of previous knowledge. Different thickness  is assigned to each variable to facilitate their visualization. In  addition, red colors have been applied to the edges in order to  identify when the student is working on previous contents.    3.3 Applying Data Mining  Educational Data Mining technics are applied to build the model  that summarizes the students learning process. To do so, there are  both commercial and free data mining tools that can be used.   Currently, Graph Mining technics are being tested with this  purpose.   3.4 Deploying Results  The resultant graph is easily and intuitively interpreted by the  teacher/ researcher according to their goals (See Figure 1).

Surprisingly, there is little evidence for this approach[3, 6]. For exam- ple, Tangen et al.[8] compare student quiz scores following three different types of lectures  with visuals relevant to the content, with visuals not relevant, and with text-based bullet points  and find no significant difference in accuracy among them. Lin and Atkinson[5] find similar results, albeit for animated vs. static graphics.  However, research on visuals may be helpfully contextual- ized by two key factors. First, visual learning formats may be more beneficial in course contexts requiring the interpre- tation of complex visual material [3, 4], such as anatomy or art history. Second, research on learning through visual- verbal presentations has relied primarily on lecture-based pedagogy, not accounting for the processing time students need to make sense of both pieces of information[5, 8]. There- fore, we offer a important case study of student learning in an anatomy course at the University of Michigan. Anatomy is a discipline with a significant visual component, for stu- dents to recognize and identify corporeal elements such as bones, ligaments, and muscles. Additionally, this course de- votes significant in-class time to active learning, which we hypothesize allows for the cognitive processing needed to en- hance student learning. Previous studies have treated active learning as a separate condition from visual and text-based learning (e.g., Tangen et al.[8], and Bockhoven[1]), but we seek to investigate their integration.  2. METHODS The study analyzes data from a University of Michigan  class, Human Musculoskeletal Anatomy, a sophomore-level course required for all students majoring in Movement Sci- ence. Taught fall and winter terms, the course averages 101 students, and it is comprised of about 60% Movement Science majors and 40% non-majors. The class provides students with an in-depth knowledge of the musculoskeletal system in order to better understand the functional relation- ships between human musculoskeletal anatomy and body movement.  Each class session consists of lecture segments punctuated with active learning activities in which students work inde- pendently or in pair-share dyads to answer interactive ques-  275    Figure 1: Examples of in-class activities  tions asked through LectureTools, interactive presentation software (Fig. 1). Both text-based and image-based activi- ties are included in each class session. Text-based activities consist of a written question and multiple-choice answers. Image-based activities consist of either a question associ- ated with a particular image (and multiple-choice answers) or an image map where students are asked to click on the image in order to answer the question. Student participation on all learning activities is tracked  using LectureTools analytics data. The number of activities in which a student participated is collected for each student. Student learning outcomes are assessed via exam question scores. Individual exam questions are written to correspond to single lecture topics (and therefore either image-based or text-based learning activities). Care is taken to write exam questions of equivalent difficulty. Regression analyses are used to look for correlations between student scores on ex- ams and student participation in learning activities. Demo- graphic data including gender, underrepresented minority status, and cumulative GPA are also included in analyses. Additionally, students were asked to participate in a end-  of-semester survey, which asked them to reflect on how much mental activity (i.e., cognitive load) was required when participating in image- and text-based activities. Survey questions were modeled on the instrument for measuring cognitive load described by Lin & Atkinson[5]. Student re- sponse rate was 88%.  3. INITIAL FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION We predicted that participation in all learning activities  would be positively correlated with student-learning out- comes. However, given the visual nature of the discipline and active learning format, we hypothesized that partic- ipation in image-based learning activities would be more strongly correlated with exam scores than participation in text-based activities. Students reported that with active learning, image-based  activities present less of a cognitive load. Nearly all students (95%) agreed or strongly agreed that LectureTools learning activities were helpful for seeing images of key ideas in the course. Additionally, on a scale of 1 to 8, with one cor- responding to easy and 8 corresponding to demanding mental activity, students rated image-based activities as 4.14 (SD=1.83) and text-based activities as 4.78 (SD=1.81), a statistically significant difference (p<0.0001). Linear regressions suggest that participation in both text-  based (r=0.46) and image-based (r=0.47) in-class activities are correlated with performance on associated exam ques- tions (p<.0001). However, when GPA is taken into account using multivariate regression, participation on text-based questions is no longer significantly correlated with exam grade (Table 1), indicating that higher performing students  Table 1: Regression model predicting exam perfor- mance with in-class participation and demographic variables.

This is not the case for image-based questions, in- dicating that participation in image-based in-class questions raises exam scores.  The active learning classroom is an ideal setting for ad- vancing our understanding of how text-based and image- based materials support student learning. In the active learning setting, students have more time to process infor- mation, thus reducing cognitive load and potentially increas- ing deeper learning, particularly with image-based activities.  4.

INTRODUCTION First inspired by ubiquitous screen capture technology, we conducted an experiment that encourages students to create video solutions to an exam problem they got wrong. Know- ing that there would probably be a wide range of quality in the content produced we also wanted to provide an effi- cient means of filtering the content using a student powered peer review system. To accomplish these, we implemented a process whereby students were assigned a problem they got  Developer and presenter Principle Investigator of E2Coach project  Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Borrowing techniques from cognitive psychology [5] to stimulate learning in the hard sciences and measuring the effect is becoming an open area of exploration[2]. To activate meta-cognitive reflection, stu- dents were asked to emphasize any mistake(s) they made on the exam in their solution explanation.  For the first study (Table: 1) in Physics 240 (Electricity and Magnetism for Engineers), students had only one chance to make a video solution and participate in peer review for the second midterm. In the later parallel studies in the Physics 135 (Mechanics for Life Scientists) and 235 (Elec- tricity and Magnetism for Life Scientists), we altered the submission requirement to use written Google documents instead of videos. The study was also expanded to include all midterms in order to explore student participation and learning effects over time.

Appropriately, the extra credit is not included in the exam data analysis.  2. PROBLEM ASSIGNMENT We wanted individual students to revisit problems that were most salient to them, therefore, most students were assigned the easiest problem they got wrong. This was to help en- sure the best opportunity for learning and reflection at the boundary of their understanding. We had to balance this with the somewhat arbitrary goal of assigning each problem an equal number of times. For voting, we tried to assign students the second easiest problem they go wrong again in an attempt to make the process most useful for them.  277    3. PARTICIPATION AND PERFORMANCE While data and results from Phys 235 and 240 will be pre- sented on the poster, for the purposes of this abstract, we will focus on Phys 135. The Fall 2013 term in Physics 135 also had the most students, most chances to participate, and a highest fraction of participants, making it the most statistically significant dataset.  Group identifier - A B C D Participations per student - 0 1 2 3 Number of students per group - 94 69 121 112  Table 2: Physics 135 F13 groups by participation  There are many ways to analyze this kind of data, but we want to try and identify any noticeable performance dif- ference between participants and non-participants. Others have established evidence of effective teaching methods using pre/post testing [1], however, in rapidly changing environ- ments where students make real time choices about learning resources a more flexible approached is needed. In general, reducing a noticeable difference to a quantified effect in this kind of data is plagued with sensitivities to hidden fac- tors, abnormal distributions, noise, and over-fitting. Match- ing techniques have been studied as a way of extracting this kind of information in observational data[3]. Therefore, we cautiously apply and present a simple one-parameter match- ing technique as a way to diminish selection bias and provide discriminating magnification of a small signal.  Figure 1: Physics 135 F13 final exam scores  Figure 2: Physics 135 F13 incoming GPAs (35 freshmen not included)  To motivate the matching technique, figures 1 and 2 illus- trate that Group A has slightly lower GPA, and slightly lower final exam scores, than group D. The reason for in- cluding the GPA plot is to see that the selection bias is visible in the GPA, a number that described the students before they started the class. Ignoring the 15 freshmen in group A, and 9 freshmen in group D who dont have an in- coming GPA the difference between D and A is (3.54 - 3.29  Figure 3: Comparison of average difference in final exam scores between two groups, the 94 students who gained credit three times and the 112 students who never participated. The bell curve represents a probability distribution for randomly drawing two groups of size 94 and 112 from the class and get- ting that difference in exam scores. The pink bar is placed at the actual difference (82.6 - 76.0 = 6.6 points) observed between groups D and A, and the green bar is placed at the estimated difference of between the two groups after matching on GPA to remove the selection bias. A 1.5 sigma effect of 3.6 exam points benefit is observed after matching on GPA (GPA  0.1). The width of the bars repre- sents the error in their position.  = 0.25) or 6.3% of the 4 point scale. This is similar to the difference in final exam scores which is (82.6 - 76.0) 6.6% on the 100 point scale.  4. CONCLUSIONS We present a novel approach to engaging students creatively in their physics coursework and a reasonable approach to measuring its effectiveness. Participation in this creative process and peer evaluation may have a positive effect on student performance, which we measured to be a 3.6 point gain on the final exam with a 1.5 sigma significance.  5.

INTRODUCTION  MOOCs have the potential to help institutions and students  needing remedial English language instruction in two ways. First,  with their capacity to use a wide range of instructional approaches  and to emphasize contextualized and visual learning, MOOCS can  offer potentially more effective pedagogical approaches for  remedial students. Second, if students increase success meeting  college-level English competencies, MOOCS can help institutions  and students conserve their limited resources. Similarly, MOOCs  offer domestically and international employers opportunities to  provide professional development to workers both in ways that  are flexible, affordable and interactive.   This poster will present the initial findings of research on a  MOOC in Pre-College English writing that provides a context for  how MOOCs can help to address these critical issues.  Specifically, the poster will present research results on the   Crafting an Effective Writer: Tools of the Trade  course offered  through the Coursera platform in Summer 2013. Sources that  inform the research include MOOC logfile data documenting  student participation with course resources and student responses  to two surveys conducted at the beginning and end of the course.   This research addresses issues in student persistence and   retention, an area that is currently the focus of substantial  attention from government and private sector course in the United  States. By examining how the use of MOOC-provided materials  can a) improve student achievement in future traditional for-credit  courses and b) de-couple the relationship between completion and  student success, this research can advance our understanding of  how MOOCs might change our perspective on conventional  remedial educational resources and supports.    2. LITERATURE ON PERSISTENCE AND  RETENTION   Research about student success in higher education is frequently  studied through the lenses of retention and persistence. Although  sometimes used interchangeably, these terms refer to different  dynamics and measures of success, as stated by Reason (2009):  Retention is an organizational phenomenon  colleges and  universities retain students ... [p]ersistence, on the other hand, is  an individual phenomenon  students persist to a goal. (p. 660).  The data for retention studies is more readily available;  institutions can easily track whether students returned annually or  graduated. It is more difficult to measure whether that retention  resulted in students meeting their goals for enrolling.    These issues map to the discussion of student completion and  success in MOOCs. Much attention has been given to MOOCs  low student completion rates (course-level retention by  Reasons definition). However, in contrast to conventional online  or in-person courses, students have neither a financial barrier to  entry nor the traditional negative consequence for not completing  the course. Further, there is no cost to the institution for low  completion. No student is refused enrollment for over-enrollment  nor is there a cost for additional students.   Empirical research on MOOCs is just beginning to emerge  (Belanger & Thornton, 2013). A consistent outcome observed in  this literature is a low completion rate compared to conventional  higher education in-person or online courses (Jordan, 2013). It has  been further noted that the students who do complete courses are  primarily mid-career professionals who use MOOCs to enhance  existing competencies created by participation in traditional  educational modalities (Tsouvalas, 2013).   Few MOOC courses to date have been offered on subjects  relevant to students without a college degree. The Gates  Foundation funded a set of courses in remedial education topics in  November 2012 and the results from those courses are just now  being reported. With such a limited history, there is little research  available on how students engage with MOOC-delivered courses  on these subjects.

COURSE ENROLLMENT AND  INTENTIONS  When first offered in May-June 2013, Crafting an Effective  Writer had 45,089 enrollments, with 29,195 (65%) active  participants in the course. Of the participants, 8,738 (30%)  responded to an entry survey that provided more information  about their backgrounds, motivations and goals for taking the  course. Students chose motivation from a list of options created  by researchers in collaboration with the faculty desigining the  course.  Although the responses to this survey are likely biased  toward more active participants, they provide insights not  available in logfile data.    Unexpected by the course creators, 6,137 (59%) of the  respondents were learning English as a Second Language and  5,179 (51%) of the students were not enrolled in formal  educational institutions. Nonetheless, only 34% had not  previously taken an online course.   Most students expected to spend a substantial amount of time in  the course, with 4,684 (44%) planning to spend from 4-6 hours,  and 2,615 (25%) planning to spend more time studying. The  motivation for spending that time is listed in Table 1 below; most  students took the course to increase their success in their career  with only one-third taking the course for other reasons. Academic  success was the second strongest motivating factor for the  respondents.   Table 1. Motivations for Taking Course   Motivation Freq. %  Jumpstart on College while in High School 84 1%   Prepare for Community College Assessment  Test (haven't taken yet) 425 4%   Improve score on Community College  Assessment Test (have already taken it) 263 2%   Support for Current Class 364 3%   Increase success in academic field 3,403 32%   Increase success in profession / career 6,762 64%   4. COURSE PARTICIPATION   Despite these motivations for success and plans to complete the  course, only 2,749 (6%) participants earned a certificate of  completion. Participation levels decreased over time and also  appeared to be related to the amount of effort required for  activities; quizzes had a higher level of participation than  assignment activities. Figure 1 displays the relative levels of  participation in MOOC activities.    Perhaps not surprising for a Pre-College writing course, the  participants more frequently accessed video segments and  learning activities with clear skill-building components;  introductory videos and forum participation, which provide a  sense of community and engagement but are not as directly  related to learning new language skills, had lower overall use by  students in the course.    Questions raised by this participation is what factors were related  to higher levels of student achievement, whether due to   background demographic factors or due to specific course design  and participation issues that occurred early in the course.  Further,  it is not yet clear what learning outcomes emerged from this  participation.  These issues and more will be investigated in future  research funded under the MOOC Research Initiative.          Figure 1. Participation Levels by Major Activities   5.

They are touted  in particular as opportunities for students in countries with low- performing education systems1,2.  However, researchers and  policymakers who work with developing countries have criticized  the capacity for MOOCs to deliver learning opportunities.  They  note that MOOCs presume a stable internet connection and  bandwidth to access video links3, that they cater to students who  already have the wherewithal to succeed in formal educational  institutions4, and that the perspective of developing country  leaders is lacking5. In this paper, we investigate country-level  differences in performance and the distribution of achievement for  those students who participated in the first edX course.   2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  We address the issue of national variation in performance by   asking the question, Are there significant differences in the  overall performance of students from different countries More  specifically, we ask: (a) Are there significant differences in mean  performance for all students, students who attempted assessments,  and certificate earners; (b) Are there significant differences in the  range and distribution of performance for these students; (c) and,  controlling for students behaviors, what national characteristics  are significant We ask these questions for the whole sample but  then focus our attention on four groups of countries with high  participationEnglish-speaking high-income countries, Hispano-  and Lusophone middle-income countries, low-middle income  countries in South Asia, and non-English high-income countries.   We draw on literature from numerous disciplines for our  work.  Comparative education research emphasizes that, even in  internationally standardized assessments, vastly different school  cultures, pedagogies, and structural factors inhibit inferences that   lump all students together or compare national systems as a  whole6. Global indicators further show that the availability and  use of computers in schools differ drastically between countries7.   In addition, studies within the US, Brazil, and other countries note  that computer use, access, and utility vary significantly by SES8,9.   Numerous studies have also demonstrated that there is a strong  correlation between national income (as measured, for instance,  by GDP per capita) and overall educational achievement10,11.   3. DATA  Our sample comprises students who participated in the first   edX MOOC, Circuits and Electronics, which was offered in the  spring of 2012. The data we analyze come from the clickstream  logs of students interactions with the site.  From these, we  estimate the country from which students access the site as well as  the time of each interaction and the website component accessed.   We observe students from 194 countries with a diversity of  backgrounds and prior experiences12; in nearly every country, we  see overwhelming heterogeneity in behaviors and performance.   We demonstrate possible systematic differences between  students from different countries in the entire 6.002x population,  and we provide a focused look at eleven countries of interest:  USA, UK, Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, India, Pakistan,  Spain, France, and Greece.  These countries all demonstrate high  numbers of participating students.  In addition, they represent  diverse national educational systems, linguistic and cultural  spaces, and different engineering education and online learning  usage profiles.  We provide results from these 11 countries  individually and in four groups: (1) English-speaking high-income  countries, in this case with notable providers of MOOCs or online  universities; (2) middle-income countries in Latin America; (3)  low-middle income countries in South Asia; and (4) non-English- speaking high-income countries in Western Europe.   4. METHODS  We first estimate the overall variation in achievement that is   attributable to group membership using a two-level random- effects model, where a students group (country) is assigned by  the country from which s/he accessed the site most frequently.   We then conduct ANOVA of student achievement and proportion  of certificate earners by region and by the four country groups of  interest.  Next, we apply a robust test of the equality of variances  to investigate the distribution of performance and completion  overall and between our four country groups of interest, which we  illustrate graphically.  Last, we show that differences persist in a  predictive model; policymakers should note systematic  differences in the profiles of students in varied contexts.   5. MEAN DIFFERENCES   We confirm that there is a great deal of heterogeneity within   each national group of students in 6.002x.  We calculate the intra- class correlation (ICC, given in Table 1) for the full set of  students, the full set of students who have scored more than 0  points, and those students in our 11 countries of interest.

Overall performance of scoring students and  certificate earners by country group  All students in sample  73,583 1.96%  All scoring in sample 20,361 2.52%   Despite this heterogeneity within countries, we also observe  significant differences in overall achievement and in the  proportion of students who receive certificates between countries,  whether or not we exclude students who do not score any points  (F = 5.52, p <0.001 for all countries; F = 90.58, p<0.001 for 11  countries of interest).  The significant differences in mean  performance and spread of performance are notable in the patterns  we can see emerging from variability between the four country  groups of interest given in Table 2.

DISTRIBUTIONAL DIFFERENCES  6.1 Differences in Distributional Profile   As Table 2 shows, there appear to be systematic differences  between country groups in the mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis  of achievement in 6.002x as well as in the performance of those  students who score any points and those who earn a certificate.   We use a robust test of the equality of variances (Levenes test)  and confirm that this systematic difference is statistically  significant (W0=661.98, p<0.001 for all students in the 11  countries of interest; W0 = 149.51, p<0.001 for scoring students).  Figure 1 shows the notable differences in profiles for these four  groups, whether we look at scoring students or certificate earners.   6.2 Predictive Model  Finally, we estimate a multi-level model wherein students are   nested in countries.  We include country characteristics such as  GDP per capita and a dummy variable for the country being  predominately English-speaking, and we control for individual  behaviors such as time spent on online homework problems or  lecture videos.  Achievement is largely related to individual  behaviors.  However, contrary to established comparative  research10, overall achievement has no significant relation with  GDP per capita.  Instead, higher achievement is related, counter- intuitively, to being in a non-English speaking country. This result  persists even when high-income, high-scoring OECD countries  such as France are excluded.  This suggests that the profile of  students in English-speaking countries such as group (1) are more  diverse, while those in non-English speaking countries group (2)  come from an already-high achieving group of students who know  about and can engage with a college-level class entirely in  English.  Further, students from group (4) show a larger, flatter  spread of scores with a notably higher mean.                           Table 3.

IMPLICATIONS  Policymakers who look to MOOCs as a tool for increasing   access must understand that the students who access these courses  in each respective context are diverse. National contexts may  suggest factors such as language as important, but we must  understand that even signing up for the course may preclude less  English-proficient students from participating.  Providing initial  information about the course in other languages and other earlier  interventions may be more promising in supporting diverse  students to learn through MOOCs. MOOC providers,  policymakers, and researchers should identify pathways to reach  students who would not otherwise be able to access this course for  MOOCs to truly increase access to educational opportunities.   8.

WORKSHOP CONCEPT  The success of the 1st International Workshop on Discourse- Centric Learning Analytics [1] demonstrated that an important  class of learning analytic is emerging that is concerned with the  use of discourse to support learning and teaching. These analytics  are being developed at the intersection of fields including  automated assessment, learning dynamics, deliberation platforms,  and computational linguistics. What moves these developments  into the category of learning analytics, as opposed to research that   sits in any of the above categories, is their use or potential to  generate actionable intelligence specifically in the context of  learning. This may include the development of information  displays that help learners and educators to understand significant  discourse patterns and to reflect on learning dialogue, or tools that  support interventions to improve discourse for learning.   Unlike other analytics, which take measures such as engagement,  attention and test scores as proxies for learning, discourse-centric  analytics offer researchers from different traditions the potential to  focus on the quality of the learning process, using (largely  written) language as a lens on the learners minds. Cognitive  constructivists approach this work from the perspective that  engaging in online dialogue encourages learners to make explicit  what they have stored in their memories, while social  constructivists may be focused on the ways in which dialogue  promotes the collaborative process during which meaning is  negotiated and knowledge co-constructed [2]. Dialogue can reveal  engagement with the ideas of others, the development of  reasoning, shifts in understanding and the ways in which learners  relate new ideas to personal understanding [3]. Studies have  shown that, in a variety of contexts, educational success and  failure can be related to the quality of learners dialogue [4, 5].  From an educators perspective, written discourse is one way of  gaining insights into deeper learning and the higher order qualities  associated with it, including critical thinking, argumentation and  mastery of complex ideas. These skills are difficult to master and  are a focus for assessment, particularly in the field of higher  education. Discourse-centric learning analytics offer the  possibility of using students written drafts to generate feedback  that will help them to reflect upon and improve the ways in which  they express their understanding [6].   The use of these analytics is not confined to the formal learning  sector; they can also be applied to informal learning, where  learners set their own goals and select their own methods of  achieving them. For example, learners can use an Evidence Hub  to make sense of the written ideas of a community. Algorithms  can be used to identify key issues, ideas and evidence and to  support the development of a reflective community of practice by  making it clear where people disagree and why [7].   Potential benefits and applications of discourse-centric analytics  are clear, yet their development and deployment face challenges.  This workshop addresses two of these in particular: fragmentation  of the field and barriers to adoption.

Even within these areas, the work and  its topics are diverse. Researchers focused on networked learning,  computer-mediated collaboration, computer-mediated discussion,  computer conferencing, and asynchronous learning networks may  all be working on similar data but with only limited opportunities  to share their conceptualisations and their findings.   This can result in a failure to build upon the work of others. De  Wever and his colleagues carried out a review of instruments used  for content analysis over a period of 13 years, from 1992 to 2005.  They examined 15 instruments and found that instruments are  hardly compared or contrasted with one another. As a  consequence, the empirical base of the validity of the instruments  is limited [2].   These studies  and the analysis of them as a group  all have  implications for DCLA, but they were carried out before the  emergence of learning analytics as a field of study. A related  cause for concern is therefore that researchers who are new to the  field may neglect or be wholly unaware of relevant work in  related areas. The DCLA community needs to be active in  identifying and sharing key research and development that has  taken place in related fields.   1.2 Barriers to adoption  The concern that researchers in the field of discourse-centric  learning analytics may not build effectively on past work is  mirrored by a concern that they may not be building effectively  for the future. Learning analytics are an element of technology- enhanced learning (TEL); they make use of online data and  computer algorithms to support both learning and teaching.   TEL is a complex system made up of many different elements, all  of which must be taken into account as an innovation is designed,  developed and embedded. Successful implementation of  discourse-centred analytics requires attention to both technology  and pedagogy. It also needs to take into account diverse elements  of the TEL complex, including activities and expectations of  learners and teachers, policies on privacy and data protection,  staff training, technical support, institutional goals and technical  infrastructure [8].   Researchers in this area therefore need to look to the bigger  picture. For these analytics to have real impact, they need to be  capable of working at scale in a variety of different contexts.  Much research and development in this area to date has focused  on catwalk technologies that demonstrate exciting new concepts  but that are also costly, difficult to maintain and impractical for  extended use, particularly if deployed in new areas [9]. Successful   mass exploitation of these analytics requires a ready-to-wear  system that can be used off the shelf without problems.    MOVING FORWARD  The challenges faced by discourse-centric learning analytics  mirror those faced by the field of learning analytics as a whole.  The DCLA workshop series therefore mirrors the development of  the LAK conferences. In 2013, the first workshop began to  address the issue of fragmentation in the field by bringing together  researchers from different communities to share ideas and tools  and to consider shared goals and visions. In 2014, the workshop  looks forward, beginning the task of achieving those goals and  visions by identifying the steps that need to be taken on the way.

BACKGROUND  This workshop continues the themes of connecting levels and  multivocality that have characterized two series of workshops  at several conferences (ARV, CSCL, ICLS, LAK). We have taken  a multi-disciplinary perspective on learning as involving the  agency of individuals, groups and communities, and sought to  understand learning across these levels by integrating multiple  methods and granularities of analysis (cf. [7,8]).    The workshop for LAK 2014 focuses on specific computational  methods and their potential for analyzing interactions in  networked learning communities from different perspectives.  Social network analysis (SNA, cf. [10]) is an approach that has  been used in studying networked learning in the past (e.g.,  [1,2,3]), and it is still of interest. However, we are particularly  interested in new methods and new combinations of different  analysis techniques and computational approaches. Martinez et al.   [4] provide an example of such a mixed method approach,  coordinating SNA with other qualitative and quantitative analysis  methods in a study of participatory aspects of learning in CSCL  contexts. Further work in automating such approaches and  exploring the complementarities of different data sources and  analytic approaches is needed.   SNA has been criticized for eliminating time from the results of  an analysis in that it aggregates data over certain time intervals  without being able to show time-dependent patterns. This can be  partially overcome by using time series of networks. Yet, Zeini et  al. have shown that also the choice of measurement intervals has  systematic effects on the resulting networks [11]. On the other  hand, there are analytic methods, such as process mining, that are  particularly geared to extracting procedural patterns from  interaction data [5]. Another group of methods deals with  extracting content information from (textual) artifacts, using both  shallow and deep linguistic techniques. At this point, we do  not expect any one of these methods to be sufficient alone or to  succeed on a purely technical level. We would rather hope to  explore a triangulation approach in which several methods are  applied to the same data sources and are interpreted in  conjunction with each other and theoretical considerations.    Although the workshop is focused on (new) computational  methods or new applications of such methods, we are also  interested in discussing computational approaches in a conceptual  and/or theoretical context. In this perspective, Suthers et al. [6,9]  have developed a rich contextual framework to interpret  collaborative interactions, introducing certain steps of inter- pretation and addressing different levels of granularity using  concepts such as contingencies and uptake (as relations  between actions or contributions). It is of particular interest to  further automate the application of such interpretation schemes.   Given these premises, we invite contributions guided by the  following questions:     How to detect emergent phenomena and patterns in traces of   collective/collaborative learning activities by using a  plurality of computational methods How do we interconnect  these methods    What practical techniques such as different types of  triangulation or visualization can help to connect different  levels and approaches of analysis    How can we integrate SNA with content analysis methods  (including LDA, LSA, Network Text Analysis) and with the  detection of interaction patterns    How can conceptually/theoretically grounded interpretation  schemes for collaborative activities be adequately  operationalized and automated   Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

WORKSHOP FORMAT  The workshop includes a mixture of framing presentations,  analysis of a shared data corpus by several analysts, and group  discussion, selected according to the submissions we receive. The  framing presentations will be given by a subset of the organizers,  and begin the workshop with overviews of the related theoretical  and methodological issues in combining computational methods  and combining process and structural analyses.   3.

Ulrich Hoppe holds a full professorship for Cooperative and  Learning Support Systems in the Department of Computer  Science and Applied Cognitive Science (Engineering Faculty) at  the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. With his research  group COLLIDE, Ulrich Hoppe has been engaged in several  European projects in the area of advanced computational  technologies in education since 1998. Currently, the COLLIDE  group participates in the European projects SISOB (Observatory  for Science in Society based in Social Models) and Go-Lab (on  inquiry learning with remote laboratories). Ulrich Hoppe has been  program chair of AIED and CSCL 2003, ICCE 2007 and CRIWG  2012. His current research interests include: interactive and  collaborative media for learning and knowledge construction;  analysis, modelling, and intelligent support of interactive and  collaborative learning processes; social network analysis and  community support.    Dan Suthers  Daniel D. Suthers is Professor in the Department of Information  and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa,  where he directs the Laboratory for Interactive Learning  Technologies. Dr. Suthers research is generally concerned with  cognitive, social and computational perspectives on designing and  evaluating software for learning, collaboration, and community.  His current focus is on social affordances of digital media: how  participants take up the potentials offered by the representational  and interactional resources of technological environments in  accomplishing their work, and how the availability of these  resources influence that work. Dr. Suthers initiated and chaired a  series of five workshops on Productive Multivocality in Analysis  of Collaborative Learning, involving dozens of researchers in a  long term collaboration leading to a book in press. Subsequently  he led workshops on Connecting Levels of Analysis at the CSCL  2011 and 2013 and LAK 2012 conferences. He has also served as  program chair for LAK, ICCE, and two CSCL conferences, and   has had steering committee roles (e.g., workshop chair, interactive  events chair) for numerous other conferences.

INTRODUCTION  Two prominent challenges exist for the LA discipline: 1) to  develop analytics methods and techniques that come from  researchers within LA and meet the specific needs and challenges  of the discipline (this is particularly important in maturing the  complexity of LA) and 2) to ensure active promotion of dialogue  and research collaboration at the edges of the computational  and social dimensions of LA.   Learning analytics projects over the past decade have relied on  reasonably well-structured data drawn from learning management  systems (LMS) and student information systems (SIS). Social  network analysis, recommender systems, as well as student  success and predictive models rely heavily on data drawn from  these systems. Increasingly, additional online data is being  generated, for example through social media, distributed learning  systems (such as gRSSHopper1) and massive open online courses  (MOOCs). Data drawn from decentralized systems is messier than  data in an LMS or SIS, thus providing further challenges for the  field of LA to address.    LA as a field has to date drawn extensively from fields such as  statistics, HCI, and research in cognitive tutors [abs]. The  interdisciplinary nature of LA brings more technical fields into  relation with more social fields. The 1st international conference  in Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) addressed this  challenge in stating2:    Advances in knowledge modeling and representation, the  semantic web, data mining, analytics, and open data form a  foundation for new models of knowledge development and  analysis. The technical complexity of this nascent field is  paralleled by a transition within the full spectrum of learning  (education, work place learning, informal learning) to social,                                                                     1 http://grsshopper.downes.ca  2 https://tekri.athabascau.ca/analytics/   287    networked learning. These technical, pedagogical, and social  domains must be brought into dialogue with each other to  ensure that interventions and organizational systems serve the  needs of all stakeholders.   The growing diversity of educational data affords researchers an  opportunity to explore new approaches, already in practice in  fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to  analyze a broader spectrum of learner data than is currently being  considered. This workshop primarily targets the role of machine  learning in extending the analytics options available to  researchers and as a means to increase the sophistication of LA  models and algorithms.   2. WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES & TOPICS  The objective of LAML is to introduce the potential of machine  learning to the learning analytics community. It is anticipated that  ML will play a substantial role in educational data in the future.    Topics in the workshop include:   MLs contribution to future LA techniques  Predictive modeling  Social network analysis  Discourse data  Bayesian analysis  Distributed datasets and analytically cloaked data  Current LA models and approaches  Information visualisation  Student modeling    MOOCs & learning at scale  Real time data analysis and targeted interventions  Student retention  Recommendation models and adaptive learning in large scale  open courses   3.
