Advances in text and video analytics provide the capability of investigating students' use of the tool and the psychometrics and linguistic processes evident in their written annotations. This paper reports on a study exploring students' use of a video annotation tool when two different instructional approaches were deployed -- graded and non-graded self-reflection annotations within two courses in the performing arts. In addition to counts and temporal locations of self-reflections, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC) framework was used for the extraction of variables indicative of the linguistic and psychological processes associated with self-reflection annotations of videos. The results indicate that students in the course with graded self-reflections adopted more linguistic and psychological related processes in comparison to the course with non-graded self-reflections. In general, the effect size of the graded reflections was lower for students who took both courses in parallel. Consistent with prior research, the study identified that students tend to make the majority of their self-reflection annotations early in the video time line. The paper also provides several suggestions for future research to better understand the application of video annotations in facilitating student learning. "}

Students' textual responses to short answer questions offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, automatically analyzing textual constructed responses poses significant computational challenges, and the difficulty of generating accurate assessments is exacerbated by the disfluencies that occur prominently in elementary students' writing. With robust text analytics, there is the potential to accurately analyze students' text responses and predict students' future success. In this paper, we present WriteEval, a hybrid text analytics method for analyzing student-composed text written in response to constructed response questions. Based on a model integrating a text similarity technique with a semantic analysis technique, WriteEval performs well on responses written by fourth graders in response to short-text science questions. Further, it was found that WriteEval's assessments correlate with summative analyses of student performance. "}

While our approach is substantially informed by both higher education and K-12 settings, this framework is developed to apply across all educational contexts where digital data are used to inform learners and the management of learning. Although we can identify movements that are relatively independent of each other today, we believe they will in all cases expand from their current margins to encompass larger domains and increasingly overlap. The growth in these analytic activities leads to the need to find ways to synthesize understandings, find common language, and develop frames of reference to help these movements develop into a field."}
