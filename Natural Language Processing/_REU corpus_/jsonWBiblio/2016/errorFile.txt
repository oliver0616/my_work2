Recently an instructional policy has been presented that is compatible with all common student models. In this work we present the next step towards a universal instructional policy. We introduce a new policy that is applicable to an even wider range of student models including DBNs modeling skill topologies and forgetting. We theoretically and empirically compare our policy to previous policies. Using synthetic and real world data sets we show that our policy can effectively handle wheel-spinning students as well as forgetting across a wide range of student models."}

We have been incorporating data-driven methods for feedback and problem selection into Deep Thought, a logic tutor where students practice constructing deductive logic proofs. In this latest study we have implemented our data-driven proficiency profiler (DDPP) into Deep Thought as a proof of concept. The DDPP determines student proficiency without expert involvement by comparing relevant student rule scores to previous students who behaved similarly in the tutor and successfully completed it. The results show that the DDPP did improve in performance with additional data and proved to be an effective proof of concept."}

However, this may not be the case for all sources of challenge. In this study of a Science learning game called Quantum Spectre, we found that students' progress through the first zone of the game seemed to encounter a roadblock during gameplay, dropping out when they cannot (or do not want to) progress further. Previously we had identified two primary types of errors in the learning game, Quantum Spectre: Science Errors related to the game's core educational content; and Puzzle Errors related to rules of the game but not to science knowledge. Using this prior analysis, alongside Survival Analysis techniques for analyzing time-series data and drop-out rates, we explored players' gameplay patterns to help us understand player dropout in Quantum Spectre. These results demonstrate that modeling player behavior can be useful for both assessing learning and for designing complex problem solving content for learning environments."}

Using data from 566 students who received intensive academic advising as part of their enrollment in the institution's pre-major/general education program, we investigate individual student, organizational, and disciplinary factors that might predict a students' potential classification in an Early Warning System as well as factors that predict improvement and decline in their academic performance. Disciplinary course type (based on Biglan's [7] typology) was significantly related to a student's likelihood to enter below average performance classifications. Students were the most likely to enter a classification in fields like the natural science, mathematics, and engineering in comparison to humanities courses. We attribute these disparities in academic performance to disciplinary norms around teaching and assessment. In particular, the timing of assessments played a major role in students' ability to exit a classification. Implications for the design of Early Warning analytics systems as well as academic course planning in higher education are offered."}

The relationships of temporal patterns to learning outcomes is a central area of interest. However, while the literature on temporal analyses is developing, there has been less consideration of the methods by which temporal analyses might be translated to actionable insights and thus, put into use in educational practice. Emerging temporal analysis techniques present both theoretical and practical challenges for producing and interpreting results. Synergetic actions are needed in order to support practitioners."}

Yet an ecosystem rich in services but lacking a common approach to measuring learning activity will find data collection, aggregation and analysis time-consuming and costly. The IMS Caliper Analytics™ specification addresses the need for data and semantic interoperability by providing an extensible information model, controlled vocabularies and an API for instrumenting learning applications and systems that log learning events. However, many learning activities have yet to be modeled by the Caliper working group. Engaging the SoLAR community directly in this effort will help ensure that the needs of researchers and other consumers of learning analytics data will inform future versions of the specification. The LAK16 Caliper workshop is being offered with this goal in mind. The half-day session, facilitated by members of Team Caliper, will provide LAK16 participants with an opportunity to extend the Caliper specification by modeling new learning activity profiles. New profiles, new connections and new friendships are expected outcomes."}
