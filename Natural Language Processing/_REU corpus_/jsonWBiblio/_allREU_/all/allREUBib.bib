 Abstract = {The field of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) in general, has the potential to solve one of the most important challenges of our time: enable everyone to learn anything, anytime, anywhere. However, if we look back at more than 50 years of research in TEL, it is not clear where we are in terms of reaching our goal and whether we are, indeed, moving forward. The pace at which technology and new ideas evolve have created a rapid, even exponential, rate of change. This rapid change, together with the natural difficulty to measure the impact of technology in something as complex as learning, has lead to a field with abundance of new, good ideas and scarcity of evaluation studies. This lack of evaluation has resulted into the duplication of efforts and a sense of no "ground truth" or "basic theory' of TEL. This article is an attempt to stop, look back and measure, if not the impact, at least the status of a small fraction of TEL, Learning Object Technologies, in the real world. The measured apparent inexistence of the reuse paradox, the two phase linear growth of repositories or the ineffective metadata quality assessment of humans are clear reminders that even bright theoretical discussions do not compensate the lack of experimentation and measurement. Both theoretical and empirical studies should go hand in hand in order to advance the status of the field. This article is an invitation to other researchers in the field to apply Informetric techniques to measure, understand and apply in their tools the vast amount of information generated by the usage of Technology Enhanced Learning systems.This paper will present the general goal of and inspiration for our work on learning analytics, that relies on attention metadata for visualization and recommendation. Through information visualization techniques, we can provide a dashboard for learners and teachers, so that they no longer need to "drive blind". Moreover, recommendation can help to deal with the "paradox of choice" and turn abundance from a problem into an asset for learning.

 Abstract = {Who we learn from, where and when is dramatically affected by the reach of the Internet. From learning for formal education to learning for pleasure, we look to the web early and often for our data and knowledge needs, but also for places and spaces where we can collaborate, contribute to, and create learning and knowledge communities. Based on the keynote presentation given at the first Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference held in 2011 in Banff, Alberta, this paper explores a social network perspective on learning with reference to social network principles and studies by the author. The paper explores the ways a social network perspective can be used to examine learning, with attention to the structure and dynamics of online learning networks, and emerging configurations such as online crowds and communities.}

 Abstract = {Drawing on sociocultural discourse analysis and argumentation theory, we motivate a focus on learners' discourse as a promising site for identifying patterns of activity which correspond to meaningful learning and knowledge construction. However, software platforms must gain access to qualitative information about the rhetorical dimensions to discourse contributions to enable such analytics. This is difficult to extract from naturally occurring text, but the emergence of more-structured annotation and deliberation platforms for learning makes such information available. Using the Cohere web application as a research vehicle, we present examples of analytics at the level of individual learners and groups, showing conceptual and social network patterns, which we propose as indicators of meaningful learning.}

A sophisticated and novel reputation system provides feedback on the scientific expertise of users, allowing users to track their own learning and that of others, in an informal learning context.

 Abstract = {In the world of recommender systems, it is a common practice to use public available datasets from different application environments (e.g. MovieLens, Book-Crossing, or Each-Movie) in order to evaluate recommendation algorithms. These datasets are used as benchmarks to develop new recommendation algorithms and to compare them to other algorithms in given settings. In this paper, we explore datasets that capture learner interactions with tools and resources. We use the datasets to evaluate and compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms for learning. We present an experimental comparison of the accuracy of several collaborative filtering algorithms applied to these TEL datasets and elaborate on implicit relevance data, such as downloads and tags, that can be used to improve the performance of recommendation algorithms.

 Abstract = {Learning and knowledge creation is often distributed across multiple media and sites in networked environments. Traces of such activity may be fragmented across multiple logs and may not match analytic needs. As a result, the coherence of distributed interaction and emergent phenomena are analytically cloaked. Understanding distributed learning and knowledge creation requires multi-level analysis of the situated accomplishments of individuals and small groups and of how this local activity gives rise to larger phenomena in a network. We have developed an abstract transcript representation that provides a unified analytic artifact of distributed activity, and an analytic hierarchy that supports multiple levels of analysis. Log files are abstracted to directed graphs that record observed relationships (contingencies) between events, which may be interpreted as evidence of interaction and other influences between actors. Contingency graphs are further abstracted to two-mode directed graphs that record how associations between actors are mediated by digital artifacts and summarize sequential patterns of interaction. Transitive closure of these associograms creates sociograms, to which existing network analytic techniques may be applied, yielding aggregate results that can then be interpreted by reference to the other levels of analysis. We discuss how the analytic hierarchy bridges between levels of analysis and theory.

 Abstract = {n recent years, studies into the reasons for dropping out of online higher education have been undertaken with greater regularity, parallel to the rise in the relative weight of this type of education, compared with brick-and-mortar education. However, the work invested in characterising the students who drop out of education, compared with those who do not, appears not to have had the same relevance as that invested in the analysis of the causes. The definition of dropping out is very sensitive to the context. In this article, we reach a purely empirical definition of student dropping out, based on the probability of not continuing a specific academic programme following several consecutive semesters of "theoretical break". Dropping out should be properly defined before analysing its causes, as well as comparing the drop-out rates between the different online programmes, or between online and on-campus ones. Our results show that there are significant differences among programmes, depending on their theoretical extension, but not their domain of knowledge.

Based on the Next Generation Teaching Education and Learning for Life (NEXT-TELL) European Commission integrated project, we envision classrooms of the 21st century to (a) incorporate 1:1 computing, (b) provide computational as well as methodological support for teachers to design, deploy and assess learning activities and (c) immerse students in rich, personalized and varied learning activities in information ecologies resulting in high-performance, high-density, high-bandwidth, and data-rich classrooms. In contrast to existing research in educational data mining and learning analytics, our vision is to employ visual analytics techniques and tools to support teachers dynamic diagnostic pedagogical decision-making in real-time and in actual classrooms. The primary benefits of our vision is that learning analytics becomes an integral part of the teaching profession so that teachers can provide timely, meaningful, and actionable formative assessments to on-going learning activities in-situ. Integrating emerging developments in visual analytics and the established methodological approach of design-based research (DBR) in the learning sciences, we introduce a new method called "Teaching Analytics" and explore a triadic model of teaching analytics (TMTA). TMTA adapts and extends the Pair Analytics method in visual analytics which in turn was inspired by the pair programming model of the extreme programming paradigm. Our preliminary vision of TMTA consists of a collocated collaborative triad of a Teaching Expert (TE), a Visual Analytics Expert (VAE), and a Design-Based Research Expert (DBRE) analyzing, interpreting and acting upon real-time data being generated by students' learning activities by using a range of visual analytics tools. We propose an implementation of TMTA using open learner models (OLM) and conclude with an outline of future work

 Abstract = {While generic web analytics tend to focus on easily harvested quantitative data, Learning Analytics will often seek qualitative understanding of the context and meaning of this information. This is critical in the case of dialogue, which may be employed to share knowledge and jointly construct understandings, but which also involves many superficial exchanges. Previous studies have validated a particular pattern of 'exploratory dialogue' in learning environments to signify sharing, challenge, evaluation and careful consideration by participants. This study investigates the use of sociocultural discourse analysis to analyse synchronous text chat during an online conference. Key words and phrases indicative of exploratory dialogue were identified in these exchanges, and peaks of exploratory dialogue were associated with periods set aside for discussion and keynote speakers. Fewer individuals posted at these times, but meaningful discussion outweighed trivial exchanges. If further analysis confirms the validity of these markers as learning analytics, they could be used by recommendation engines to support learners and teachers in locating dialogue exchanges where deeper learning appears to be taking place.}

The objective of this article is to identify Westerman's [12] key arguments and apply them to the practice of Learning Analytics in educational interventions. The primary implication for Learning Analytics practitioners is the need to interpret quantitative analysis procedures at every phase from philosophy to conclusions. Furthermore, Learning Analytics practitioners and consumers must critically examine any assumption that suggests quantitative methodologies in Learning Analytics are inherently objective or that Learning Analytics algorithms may replace judgment rather than aid it. Lastly we propose a method for making observational data in virtual environments concrete through nested models.}

 Abstract = {Multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) allow many users to explore the environment and interact with other users as they learn new content and share their knowledge with others. The semi-synchronous communicative interaction within these learning environments is typically text-based Internet relay chat (IRC). IRC data is stored in the form of chatlogs and can generate a large volume of data, posing a difficulty for researchers looking to evaluate learning in the interaction by analyzing and interpreting the patterns of communication structure and related content. This paper describes procedures for the measurement and visualization of chat-based communicative interaction in MUVEs. Methods are offered for structural analysis via social networks, and content analysis via semantic networks. Measuring and visualizing social and semantic networks allows for a window into the structure of learning communities, and also provides for a large cache of analytics to explore individual learning outcomes and group interaction in any virtual interaction. A case study on a learning based MUVE, SRI's Tapped-In community, is used to elaborate analytic methods.}

 Abstract = {Learning portals are education-oriented Web portals, which provide access to a variety of educational material, usually coming from various sources. In order to explore how they can support their users during an educational activity (e.g. preparation of teaching a course), it would be interesting to study the behavior of their visitors, focusing on the particular context in which specific actions are taking place. For example, user activities may be analyzed during specific learning events, when activities are more focused. This paper discusses the case study of the Organic.Edunet Web portal (www.organic-edunet.eu), a learning portal for organic agriculture educators that provides access to more than 10,500 learning resources from a federation of 11 institutional repositories. The portal mostly focuses on serving school teachers and university tutors and has attracted until today almost 42.200 unique visitors from more than 160 countries, out of which about 2.600 have registered to the portal. An effort is made to study the users' behavior, focusing in tutors and educators in both schools and universities, in relation to specific training events in which we know that they have been involved. Therefore, we analyze logs of user activities that took place on specific dates and geographical locations, in order to potentially identify notable changes in their normal visiting behavior.}

 Abstract = {Government and institutionally-driven reforms focused on quality teaching and learning in universities emphasize the importance of developing replicable, scalable teaching approaches that can be evaluated. In this context, learning design and learning analytics are two fields of research that may help university teachers design quality learning experiences for their students, evaluate how students are learning within that intended learning context and support personalized learning experiences for students. Learning Designs are ways of describing an educational experience such that it can be applied across a range of disciplinary contexts. Learning analytics offers new approaches to investigating the data associated with a learner's experience. This paper explores the relationship between learning designs and learning analytics.}

This paper discusses opportunities for improving online and blended learning by collecting formative data during course presentation. With a goal of overall improvement in instructional effectiveness and identification of promising practices for inclusion in a learning activities design library, we propose the immediate and on-going monitoring of the effectiveness of learning activities, tutor facilitation and learner satisfaction during the course presentation. This has implications for constructively involving the learners and facilitators in the course improvement process. While originally conceived to reduce the time for pilot evaluation of new courses and learning activities, the proposed system could also be extended to individualized and blended learning environments, and if implemented using semantic web technologies, for research into the effectiveness of learning activity }

 Abstract = {Most of the current learning analytic techniques have as starting point the data recorded by Learning Management Systems (LMS) about the interactions of the students with the platform and among themselves. But there is a tendency on students to rely less on the functionality offered by the LMS and use more applications that are freely available on the net. This situation is magnified in studies in which students need to interact with a set of tools that are easily installed on their personal computers. This paper shows an approach using Virtual Machines by which a set of events occurring outside of the LMS are recorded and sent to a central server in a scalable and unobtrusive manner.

Providing forum facilitators with access to these forms of data visualisations and social network metrics in 'real-time', allows emergent interaction patterns to be analysed and interventions to be undertaken as required. SNAPP essentially serves as an interaction diagnostic tool that assists in bringing the affordances of 'real-time' social network analysis to fruition. This paper details the functional features included in SNAPP 2.0 and how they relate to learning activity intent and participant monitoring. SNAPP 2.0 includes the ability to view the evolution of participant interaction over time and annotate key events that occur along this timeline. This feature is useful in terms of monitoring network evolution and evaluating the impact of intervention strategies on student engagement and connectivity. SNAPP currently supports discussion forums found in popular commercial and open source Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Blackboard, Desire2Learn and Moodle and works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox.}

 Abstract = {In online learning environments, teachers and course designers often get little feedback about how students actually interact with and learn in online courses. Most of the learning systems used by educational institutions store comprehensive log data associated with students' behaviours and actions. However, these systems typically reveal or report on very general and limited information based on this data. In order to provide teachers and course designers with more detailed and meaningful information about students' behaviour and their use of learning resources within online courses, an analytics tool has been developed. The tool incorporates functionality to access and analyse data related to students' behaviours in learning systems. This tool can provide valuable information about students' learning processes allowing the identification of difficult or inappropriate learning material, and can therefore significantly contribute to the design of improved student support activities and resources.

 Abstract = {Web-based learning systems offer researchers the ability to collect and analyze fine-grained educational data on the performance and activity of students, as a basis for better understanding and supporting learning among those students. The availability of this data enables stakeholders to pose a variety of interesting questions, often specifically focused on some subset of students. As a system matures, the number of stakeholders, the number of interesting questions, and the number of relevant sub-populations of students also grow, adding complexity to the data analysis task. In this work, we describe an internal analytics system designed and developed to address this challenge, adding flexibility and scalability. Here we present several examples of typical examples of analysis, discuss a few uncommon but powerful use-cases, and share lessons learned from the first two years of iteratively developing the platform.}

 Abstract = {The amount of data about us and our world is increasing rapidly, and the capability to analyze large data sets---so-called big data---becomes a key basis of competition, underpinning new waves of productivity growth and innovation. The big data phenomenon is fueled by cheap sensors and high-throughput simulation models, the increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, the rise of multimedia, social media, and the Internet. It exists from social media to cell biology offering unparalleled opportunities to document the inner workings of many complex systems [1]. Research by MGI and McKinsey's Business Technology Office argues that there will be a shortage of talent necessary for organizations to take advantage of big data. "By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions" [2].

In everyday life, people deal with large amounts of data regularly: online search engines provide access to millions of web sites almost instantly; consumer sites offer literally thousands of purchase options seamlessly; and social media sites let you create and benefit from extensive social networks.

In bestselling books like Freakonomics, Super Crunchers and The Numerati, authors illuminate how more and more decisions in health care, politics, education, and other sectors utilize big data and data analysis [3]. The texts highlight the growing need for specialists and every-day citizens to be able to understand and interpret data. Whether it is a table of nutritional information, a graph of stock prices, or a chart comparing health care plans, the skills of understanding and interpreting data are necessary to navigate successfully through daily life.

This talk starts with a review of visual analytics projects that aim to increase our understanding of how people learn, increase the efficacy of learning environments, or support decision making in education [4]. The second part of the talk provides a theoretical framework for the design of effective data analysis workflows and insightful visualizations. It also introduces plug-and-play macroscope tools [5], see also http://cishell.org, that were designed for different research communities and are used by more than 120,000 users from 40+ countries to design and benefit from visualizations of complex data.

The talk concludes with a discussion of challenges that arise when visual analytics tools are introduced to classrooms and informal science education.}

 Abstract = {Learning analytics are rapidly being implemented in different educational settings, often without the guidance of a research base. Vendors incorporate analytics practices, models, and algorithms from datamining, business intelligence, and the emerging "big data" fields. Researchers, in contrast, have built up a substantial base of techniques for analyzing discourse, social networks, sentiments, predictive models, and in semantic content (i.e., "intelligent" curriculum). In spite of the currently limited knowledge exchange and dialogue between researchers, vendors, and practitioners, existing learning analytics implementations indicate significant potential for generating novel insight into learning and vital educational practices. This paper presents an integrated and holistic vision for advancing learning analytics as a research discipline and a domain of practices. Potential areas of collaboration and overlap are presented with the intent of increasing the impact of analytics on teaching, learning, and the education system.}

 Abstract = {This paper proposes that Social Learning Analytics (SLA) can be usefully thought of as a subset of learning analytics approaches. SLA focuses on how learners build knowledge together in their cultural and social settings. In the context of online social learning, it takes into account both formal and informal educational environments, including networks and communities. The paper introduces the broad rationale for SLA by reviewing some of the key drivers that make social learning so important today. Five forms of SLA are identified, including those which are inherently social, and others which have social dimensions. The paper goes on to describe early work towards implementing these analytics on SocialLearn, an online learning space in use at the UK's Open University, and the challenges that this is raising. This work takes an iterative approach to analytics, encouraging learners to respond to and help to shape not only the analytics but also their associated recommendations.}

 Abstract = {Traditional models of learning using a sociological perspective include social learning, situated learning and models of connectivisim and self-efficacy. While these models explain how individuals learn in varying social dimensions, very few studies provide empirical validation of such models and extend them to include group learning and performance. In this exploratory study, we develop a theoretical model based on social learning and social network theories to understand how knowledge professionals engage in learning and performance, both as individuals and as groups. We investigate the association between egocentric network properties (structure, position and tie), 'content richness' in the social learning process and performance. Analysis from data collected using an online eLearning environment shows that rather than performance; social learning is influenced by properties of social network structure (density, inter-group and intra-network communication), relations (tie strength) and position (efficiency). Furthermore, individuals who communicate with others internal rather than external to the group show higher tendencies of social learning. The contribution of this study is therefore two-fold: a theoretical development of a social learning and networks based model for understanding learning and performance; and the construction of a novel metric called 'content richness' as a surrogate measure for social learning. In conclusion, a useful implication of the study is that the model fosters understanding social factors that influence learning and performance in the domain of learning analytics. It also begs the question of whether the relationship between social networks and performance is mediated or moderated by learning and whether assumptions of the model hold true in non-educational domains.}

Also, these socio-technical networks are typically multi-mediated, in that they offer multiple means of participation, each with their own interactional affordances. Different communities may be using the multiple media in different ways. We have developed an analytic framework for extracting events from log files and representing interaction and affiliations at different granularities as needed for analysis. In this paper we show how bimodal networks of actors and media artifacts can be constructed in which directed arcs relate actors to the artifacts they read, write or edit, and how the resulting graphs can be used to detect community structures that extend across different media. We illustrate these ideas with a study that characterizes community structure within the Tapped In network of educational professionals, and how the associations between members of this network are distributed across media (chat rooms, discussion forums and file sharing).}

The power of social networking technology can also be leveraged to improve education and enhance the instructor and learner experience. Unlike conventional learning management systems, social software environments such as Athabasca Landing provide a persistent space and are flexible enough to support social and learner-led methods of informal, non-formal, and formal learning. Analytics can be used to effectively track and measure personal progress and help uncover extra-curricular factor affecting learner success such as network formation and growth. The paper reports on an attempt to explore this problem through analysis of student behaviour on the Athabasca Landing site within the context of a course. Its findings, explanation, and potential implications are listed. Effects of social learning on learners, based on the learner's behaviour before, during, and after the course are described and discussed. Finally, features of an open source tool created for this analysis, LASSIE is presented.}

 Abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of informal workplace learning in contemporary face-to-face and virtual environments. Informal learning is an important driver for professional development and workplace learning. However powerful informal learning may be, there is a problem when it comes to making it a real asset within organizations: Informal learning activities are mostly invisible to others, sometimes the learners themselves might not even be aware of the learning that occurs. As a consequence informal learning in organizations goes undetected, remains off the radar of HR departments and is therefore hard to asses, manage and value [1]. This problem poses an interesting challenge for the field of Learning Analytics, namely finding ways to capture and analyse traces of (social) informal learning in every day life and work networks. Therefore empirical research and tools are needed that can raise awareness about informal learning activities to make it surface the radar, amplify the benefits of it and strengthen the social relations through which it occurs. In this paper we introduce a tool that aims to facilitate exactly this and we hope to stimulate to widen the discussion on Learning Analytics by expanding the field from a predominantly educational focus to informal and workplace learning. In this paper we will discuss methodologies that Learning Analytics can draw upon to make informal learning more explicit and accessible to analyse and to share amongst professionals.}

We propose a visual method to extract communities of cyberlearners in a large interconnected network consisting of cyberlearners and learning resources. The method used is heuristic and is based on visual clustering and a modularity measure. Each cluster of users is considered as a subset of the community of learners sharing a similar domain of interest. Accordingly, a recommender system is proposed to predict and recommend learning resources to cyberlearners within the same community. Experiments on real, dynamic data reveal the structure of community in the network. Our approach used the optimal discovered structure based on the modularity value to design a recommender system.}

 Abstract = {One of the first and basic mathematical knowledge of school children is the multiplication table. At the age of 8 to 10 each child has to learn by training step by step, or more scientifically, by using a behavioristic learning concept. Due to this fact it can be mentioned that we know very well about the pedagogical approach, but on the other side there is rather less knowledge about the increase of step-by-step knowledge of the school children.

In this publication we present some data documenting the fluctuation in the process of acquiring the multiplication tables. We report the development of an algorithm which is able to adapt the given tasks out of a given pool to unknown pupils. For this purpose a web-based application for learning the multiplication table was developed and then tested by children. Afterwards so-called learning curves of each child were drawn and analyzed by the research team as well as teachers carrying out interesting outcomes. Learning itself is maybe not as predictable as we know from pedagogical experiences, it is a very individualized process of the learners themselves.

It can be summarized that the algorithm itself as well as the learning curves are very useful for studying the learning success. Therefore it can be concluded that learning analytics will become an important step for teachers and learners of tomorrow.}

This information allows us to construct models predicting student performance with a dispersion of half a letter grade. We explore residuals to this model, conducting structured interviews with students who did better (and worse) than expected, identifying strategies which lead to student success (and failure) at all levels of preparation. This work was done in preparation for the launch of E2Coach: a computer tailored educational coaching project which provides a model for an intervention engine, capable of dealing with actionable information for thousands of students.

 Abstract = {Theoretical and empirical evidence in the learning sciences substantiates the view that deep engagement in learning is a function of a complex combination of learners' identities, dispositions, values, attitudes and skills. When these are fragile, learners struggle to achieve their potential in conventional assessments, and critically, are not prepared for the novelty and complexity of the challenges they will meet in the workplace, and the many other spheres of life which require personal qualities such as resilience, critical thinking and collaboration skills. To date, the learning analytics research and development communities have not addressed how these complex concepts can be modelled and analysed, and how more traditional social science data analysis can support and be enhanced by learning analytics. We report progress in the design and implementation of learning analytics based on a research validated multidimensional construct termed "learning power". We describe, for the first time, a learning analytics infrastructure for gathering data at scale, managing stakeholder permissions, the range of analytics that it supports from real time summaries to exploratory research, and a particular visual analytic which has been shown to have demonstrable impact on learners. We conclude by summarising the ongoing research and development programme and identifying the challenges of integrating traditional social science research, with learning analytics and modelling.

Learning is integral to the success of these communities as it encourages contribution on an individual level, helps to build and sustain commitment on a group level and provides a means for adaption at an organisational level. While some communities have established ways to support organisational learning -- through a forum or thread reserved for community discussion -- few have investigated how more in-depth visual and analytic interfaces could help formalise this process. In this paper, we explore how social network visualisation can be used to encourage reflection and thus support organisational learning in online communities. We make the following contributions: First, we describe Commons-Based Peer Production, in terms of a socio-technical learning system that includes individual, group and organisational learning. Second, we present a novel visualisation environment that embeds social network visualisation in an asynchronous collaborative architecture. Third, we present results from an evaluation and discuss the potential for visualisation to support the process of organisational reflection in online communities.}

Reflective learning means returning to and evaluating past experiences in order to promote continuous learning and improve future experiences. Whilst the reflective learning theories do not sufficiently consider technical support, Quantified Self (QS) approaches are rather experimental and the many emergent tools are disconnected from the goals and benefits of their use. This paper brings these two strands into one unified framework that shows how QS approaches can support reflective learning processes on the one hand and how reflective learning can inform the design of new QS tools for informal learning purposes on the other hand.}

Moreover, learning at workplace is contextual and on-demand, thus requiring organizations to recognize and motivate the learning and knowledge building activities of their employees, where individual learning goals are harmonized with those of the organization. In particular, we focus on the analytics-based features of Learn-B, illustrate their design and current implementation, and discuss how each of them is hypothesized to target the above challenges.}

A clear common understanding and vision for the domain has not yet formed among the educator and research community. To investigate this situation, we distributed a stakeholder survey in September 2011 to an international audience from different sectors of education. The findings provide some further insights into the current level of understanding and expectations toward learning analytics among stakeholders. The survey was scaffolded by a conceptual framework on learning analytics that was developed based on a recent literature review. It divides the domain of learning analytics into six critical dimensions. The preliminary survey among 156 educational practitioners and researchers mostly from the higher education sector reveals substantial uncertainties in learning analytics.

In this article, we first briefly introduce the learning analytics framework and its six domains that formed the backbone structure to our survey. Afterwards, we describe the method and key results of the learning analytics questionnaire and draw further conclusions for the field in research and practice. The article finishes with plans for future research on the questionnaire and the publication of both data and the questions for others to utilize.}

To realise the potential of learning analytics to impact on student retention and success, mega open distance learning (ODL) institutions face a number of challenges, paradoxes and opportunities.

For the purpose of this paper we critique a 'closed' view of learning analytics as focusing only on data produced by students' interactions with institutions of higher learning. Students are not the only actors in their learning journeys and it would seem crucial that learning analytics also includes the impacts of all stakeholders on students' learning journeys in order to increase the success of students' learning. As such the notion of 'Thirdspace' as used by cultural, postmodern and identity theorists provide a useful heuristic to map the challenges and opportunities, but also the paradoxes of learning analytics and its potential impact on student success and retention.

This paper explores some of these challenges, paradoxes and opportunities with reference to two mega ODL institutions namely the Open University in the UK (OU) and the University of South Africa (Unisa). Although these two institutions share a number of characteristics, there are also some major and important differences between them. We explore some of the shared challenges, paradoxes and opportunities learning analytics offer in the context of these two institutions.}

 Abstract = {We propose a novel design of a Student Success System (S3), a holistic analytical system for identifying and treating at-risk students. S3 synthesizes several strands of risk analytics: the use of predictive models to identify academically at-risk students, the creation of data visualizations for reaching diagnostic insights, and the application of a case-based approach for managing interventions. Such a system poses numerous design, implementation, and research challenges. In this paper we discuss a core research challenge for designing early warning systems such as S3. We then propose our approach for meeting that challenge. A practical implementation of an student risk early warning system, utilizing predictive models, must meet two design criteria: a) the methodology for generating predictive models must be flexible to allow generalization from one context to another; b) the underlying mechanism of prediction should be easily interpretable by practitioners whose end goal is to design meaningful interventions on behalf of students. Our proposed solution applies an ensemble method for predictive modeling using a strategy of decomposition. Decomposition provides a flexible technique for generating and generalizing predictive models across different contexts. Decomposition into interpretable semantic units, when coupled with data visualizations and case management tools, allows practitioners, such as instructors and advisors, to build a bridge between prediction and intervention.}

 Abstract = {The use of technology in every day tasks enables the possibility to collect large amounts of observations of events taking place in different environments. Most tools are capable of storing a detailed account of the operations executed by users in certain files commonly known as logs. These files can be further analyzed to infer information that is not directly visible such as the most popular applications, times of the day with highest activity, calories burnt after a running session, etc. Graphic visualizations of this data can be used to support this type of analysis as shown in [1]. Visualization can also be applied in the domain of learning experiences to track and analyse the data obtained from both learners and instructors. There are several tools that have been proposed in specific environments such as, for example, in personal learning environments [5], to foster self-reflection and awareness [2], and to support instructors in web-based distance learning [3]. These visualizations need to take into account aspects such as how to access and protect personal data, filter management, multi-user support and availability. In this paper, the web-based visualization platform GLASS (Gradient's Learning Analytics System) is presented. The architecture of the tool has been conceived to support a large number of modular visualizations derived from a common dataset containing a large number of recorded events. The tool was developed following a bottom-up methodology to provide a set of basic operations required by any visualization. The design goal is to provide a highly versatile, modular platform that simplifies the implementation of new visualizations.

The main functionality elements considered in GLASS are database access, module management, visualization parameters, and the web interface. The platform uses datasets stored using the CAM schema (Contextualized Attention Metadata) [6]. This schema allows to capture events occurring during the use of various computer applications which, in our case, are the tools used by students when working in a learning environment. The process to obtain events from learning environments has been described in [4]. GLASS is able to connect to more than one CAM database, thus allowing access to events obtained in different contexts.

The tool is extensible through the installation of modules. A module is a structured set of scripts and resources that, given a dataset of events and a set of filters, generates at least one visualization. In order to simplify the development of new modules, the platform provides an API to manage common visualizations settings such as the date range and other typical filters. A visualization may include a simpler version suitable to be displayed in the user's Dashboard, which is the entry page of the application. Figure 1 shows an example of dashboard in GLASS. Additionally, visualizations can be exported as HTML code to be embedded in another website.

The GLASS architecture consists of four layers: data layer, code base, modules and visualizations, as depicted in Figure 2. The data layer is composed of a set of CAM databases and a database to store the platform parameters. The code base is in charge of the main functionalities of GLASS regarding module and user management and interfaces. Modules must comply with the platform specifications to generate visualizations and the settings that can affect their appearance. Currently, the tool includes a default module that provides two visualizations as shown in Figure 1): a frequency time line of activity events and a bar-chart with grouped bars of events generated by different user groups (e.g. events from students individually, or groups). The default module also serves as an example of how to develop a additional modules.

Currently, GLASS is able to support new visualizations and is undergoing additional testing in different learning scenarios. Preliminary results obtained from user tests indicate that visualizations need to be very intuitive for both instructors and learners. The current development effort is focused on providing visualizations that show the most-common learners events and the most active learners in a given context. To encourage its use in other institutions, the tool has been released with an open source license and can be obtained from http://glass.mozart.gast.it.uc3m.es. A video demonstrating the tool is available at http://bit.ly/glass-lak12.

 Abstract = {Due to the idiosyncrasy of online education, students may become disoriented, frustrated or confused if they do not receive the support, feedback or guidance needed to be successful. To avoid this, the role of teachers is essential. In this regard, instructors should be facilitators who guide students throughout the teaching-learning process and arrange meaningful learner-centered experiences. However, unlike face-to-face classes, teachers have difficulty in monitoring their learners in an online environment, since a lot of learning management systems provide faculty with student tracking data in a poor tabular format that is difficult to understand. In order to overcome this drawback, this paper presents a novel graphical educational monitoring tool based on faceted browsing that helps instructors to gain an insight into their classrooms' performance. Moreover, this tool depicts information of each individual student by using a data portrait. Thanks to this monitoring tool, teachers can, on the one hand, track their students during the teaching-learning process and, on the other, detect potential problems in time.}

 Abstract = {A large body of research in the learning sciences has focused on students' commonsense science knowledge---the everyday knowledge of the natural world that is gained outside of formal instruction. Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, one-on-one clinical interviews have played a unique and central role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts, and coded by human analysts. In my team's work on learning analytics, we draw on this same type of data, but we attempt to automate its analysis. In this paper, I describe the success we have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics---methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode, as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this paper are primarily methodological in nature; I will attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews. As a test bed, I draw on transcripts of a corpus of interviews in which 54 middle school students were asked to explain the seasons.}

 Abstract = {Simulated environments for learning are becoming increasingly popular to support experiential learning in complex domains. A key challenge when designing simulated learning environments is how to align the experience in the simulated world with real world experiences. Social media resources provide user-generated content that is rich in digital traces of real world experiences. People comments, tweets, and blog posts in social spaces can reveal interesting aspects of real world situations or can show what particular group of users is interested in or aware of. This paper examines a systematic way to analyze user-generated content in social media resources to provide useful information for learning simulator design. A hybrid framework exploiting Machine Learning and Semantics for social group profiling is presented. The framework has five stages: (1) Retrieval of user-generated content from the social resource (2) Content noise filtration, removing spam, abuse, and content irrelevant to the learning domain; (3) Deriving individual social profiles for the content authors; (4) Clustering of individuals into groups of similar authors; and (5) Deriving group profiles, where interesting concepts suitable for the use in simulated learning systems are extracted from the aggregated content authored by each group. The framework is applied to derive group profiles by mining user comments on YouTube videos. The application is evaluated in an experimental study within the context of learning interpersonal skills in job interviews. The paper discusses how the YouTube-based group profiles can be used to facilitate the design of a job interview skills learning simulator, considering: (1) identifying learning needs based on digital traces of real world experiences; and (2) augmenting learner models in simulators based on group characteristics derived from social media.}

The paper presents a case study where the analysis method was evaluated by analyzing co-blogging data from a reading and writing intensive undergraduate course. The evidence shows that the tool can be predictive of students' writing in a manner that correlates with their progress in the course and engagement in the technology-mediated activity. By visualizing otherwise subjective information in a way that is objectively intelligible, the goal is to provide educators with the ability to monitor student investment in concepts from the course syllabus, and to extend or modify the boundaries of the syllabus in anticipation of pre-existing knowledge or trends in interest. A tool of this sort can be of value particularly in larger gateway courses, where the sheer size of the class makes the ongoing evaluation of student progress a daunting if not otherwise impossible task.}

 Abstract = {This paper explores the ways in which participants in writing intensive environments might use learning analytics to make productive interventions during, rather than after, the collaborative construction of written artifacts. Specifically, our work considered how university students learning in a knowledge work model---one that is collaborative, project-based, and that relies on consistent peer-to-peer interaction and feedback---might leverage learning analytics as formative assessment to foster metacognition and improve final deliverables. We describe Uatu, a system designed to visualize the real time contribution and edit history of collaboratively written documents. After briefly describing the technical details of this system, we offer initial findings from a fifteen week qualitative case study of 8 computer science students who used Uatu in conjunction with Google Docs while collaborating on a variety of writing and programming tasks. These findings indicate both the challenges and promise of delivering useful metrics for collaborative writing scenarios in academe and industry.}

A British business school course for second year undergraduates was studied over two years (i.e. two cohorts) and the results were combined to derive categories of learner types. We conclude that that academic attainment does not appear to be related to student access behaviour necessarily.}

 Abstract = {In many educational institutions, face to face as well as on-line teaching is supported by the use of a Learning Management System (LMS). To be able to analyze better data stored by LMS, we have started developing a dedicated tool for this purpose. While analyzing usage data with teachers, we have noticed that the number of students attempting non self-tests decreases during the semester. Teachers were interested in investigating this pattern further to uncover the strategy adopted by students. In this paper, we explain our approach to investigate the core group effect in resources usage: given a set of resources, is a group of students emerging that continuously uses the resources or, on the contrary, are the resources used on an irregular basis by different students? We answer this question checking the confidence of what we call local rules and global rules. We show a case study conducted with our analysis tool as a first step to validate our approach.}

The data collected is based off of students' interactions with Cognitive Tutor learning software. Analysis suggested that more complex functions did not fit the data significantly better than a linear function. In addition, there was not evidence that the length of a specific pause matters for predicting learning outcomes; e.g. students who make many short pauses do not appear to learn more or less than students who make a smaller number of long pauses. As such, previous theoretical accounts arguing that off-task behavior primarily reduces learning by reducing the amount of time spent learning remain congruent with the current evidence.}

Our approach does not rely on the content of the learning objects or on the relations between the users and the learning objects but on usage-based relations between the objects themselves. The technique we apply for calculating higher order co-occurrences to create semantically homogenous clusters of data objects is taken from corpus driven lexicology where it is used to cluster words. We expect the members of a higher order co-occurrence class to be similar according to their content and present the evaluations of that assumption using two teaching and learning systems.}

The use of a two-stage analysis strategy based on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper to identify different participation profiles adopted by learners in online discussion forums. Different parameters are used to characterize learners' activity (amount of posts, rhythm, depth of threads, crossed replies, etc). Participation profiles are identified and analyzed in terms of behavior and performance.}

We gather data from students working on problems in the logic domain, and show that the model estimates of rule difficulty correspond well to expert opinions. We also show that the estimated start competence corresponds well to our expectations based on the previous experience of the students in the logic domain. We point out that this model can be used to inform students about their competence and learning, and teachers about the students and the difficulty and discriminativity of the rules.}

The outcome is delivered to the students via a personalized email from the faculty member to each student, as well as a specific color on a stoplight -- traffic signal -- to indicate how each student is doing. The system itself is explained in detail, along with retention and performance outcomes realized since its implementation. In addition, faculty and student perceptions will be shared.}

Dialogue in this middle space involves diverse stakeholders from multiple disciplines with various conceptions of the agency and nature of learning. We hold that a singularly unified field is not possible nor even desirable if we are to leverage the potential of this diversity, but progress is possible if we support "productive multivocality" between the diverse voices involved, facilitated by appropriate use of boundary objects. We summarize the submitted papers and contents of these Proceedings to characterize the voices and topics involved in the multivocal discourse of Learning Analytics.},

This application allows audience members to easily provide and quantify their feedback through a simple meter. We conducted several experimental tests to investigate the acceptance and perceived usefulness of the LIM App and a user study in an academic setting to inform its further development. The results of the study illustriate the potential of the LIM App to be used in such scenarios. Main findings show the need for motivating students to use the application, the readiness of presenters to learn retrospectively, and distraction as the main concern of end users.},

abstract = {The use of cloud computing writing tools, such as Google Docs, by students to write collaboratively provides unprecedented data about the progress of writing. This data can be exploited to gain insights on how learners' collaborative activities, ideas and concepts are developed during the process of writing. Ultimately, it can also be used to provide support to improve the quality of the written documents and the writing skills of learners involved. In this paper, we propose three visualisation approaches and their underlying techniques for analysing writing processes used in a document written by a group of authors: (1) the revision map, which summarises the text edits made at the paragraph level, over the time of writing. (2) the topic evolution chart, which uses probabilistic topic models, especially Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its extension, DiffLDA, to extract topics and follow their evolution during the writing process. (3) the topic-based collaboration network, which allows a deeper analysis of topics in relation to author contribution and collaboration, using our novel algorithm DiffATM in conjunction with a DiffLDA-related technique. These models are evaluated to examine whether these automatically discovered topics accurately describe the evolution of writing processes. We illustrate how these visualisations are used with real documents written by groups of graduate students.},

A pedagogical model that translates the concepts and findings of the research program into guidelines for practice and analytics with which students and instructors can assess their discussion participation are presented. The analytics are both embedded in the learning environment and extracted from it, allowing for integrated and reflective metacognitive activity. The pedagogical intervention is based on the principles of (1) Integration (2) Diversity (of Metrics) (3) Agency (4) Reflection (5) Parity and (6) Dialogue. Details of an initial implementation of this approach and preliminary findings are described. Initial results strongly support the value of student-teacher dialogue around the analytics. In contrast, instructor parity in analytics use did not seem as important to students as was expected. Analytics were reported as useful in validating invisible discussion activity, but at times triggered emotionally-charged responses.},

Learning Analytics (LA) is a new assessment technology and should engage with this literature since it has implications for when and why different LA tools might be deployed. This paper discusses these issues, relating them to an example construct, epistemic beliefs -- beliefs about the nature of knowledge -- for which analytics grounded in pragmatic, sociocultural theory might be well placed to explore. This example is particularly interesting given the role of epistemic beliefs in the everyday knowledge judgements students make in their information processing. Traditional psychological approaches to measuring epistemic beliefs have parallels with high stakes testing regimes; this paper outlines an alternative LA for epistemic beliefs which might be readily applied to other areas of interest. Such sociocultural approaches afford opportunity for engaging LA directly in high quality pedagogy.},

One of the most important tools employed during this process is language. In this paper we take exploratory dialogue, a joint form of co-reasoning, to be an external indicator that learning is taking place. Using techniques developed within the field of computational linguistics, we build on previous work using cue phrases to identify exploratory dialogue within online discussion. Automatic detection of this type of dialogue is framed as a binary classification task that labels each contribution to an online discussion as exploratory or non-exploratory. We describe the development of a self-training framework that employs discourse features and topical features for classification by integrating both cue-phrase matching and k-nearest neighbour classification. Experiments with a corpus constructed from the archive of a two-day online conference show that our proposed framework outperforms other approaches. A classifier developed using the self-training framework is able to make useful distinctions between the learning dialogue taking place at different times within an online conference as well as between the contributions of individual participants.},

In the treatment group, they could see the gaze of their partner displayed on the screen in real-time. In the control group, they could not. Dyads in the treatment group achieved a higher quality of collaboration and a higher learning gain. In this paper, we describe how network analysis techniques can further illuminate these results, and contribute to the development of 'collaboration sensing'. More specifically, we describe two contributions: first, one can use networks to visualize and explore eye-tracking data. Second, network metrics can be computed to interpret the properties of the graph. We conclude with comments on implementing this approach for formal learning environments.},

The relationships between affect and learning outcomes have been previously studied, but not in a manner that is both longitudinal and finer-grained. Affect detectors are used to estimate student affective states based on post-hoc analysis of tutor log-data. For every student action in the tutor the detectors give us an estimated probability that the student is in a state of boredom, engaged concentration, confusion, and frustration, and estimates of the probability that they are exhibiting off-task or gaming behaviors. We ran the detectors on two years of log-data from 8th grade student use of the ASSISTments math tutoring system and collected corresponding end of year, high stakes, state math test scores for the 1,393 students in our cohort. By correlating these data sources, we find that boredom during problem solving is negatively correlated with performance, as expected; however, boredom is positively correlated with performance when exhibited during scaffolded tutoring. A similar pattern is unexpectedly seen for confusion. Engaged concentration and frustration are both associated with positive learning outcomes, surprisingly in the case of frustration.},

However, there have been few attempts to use analytics to understand the new media literacy skills that may be embedded in an individual's participation in social media. In this paper, I collect raw activity data that was shared by an exploratory sample of Facebook users. I then utilize factor analysis and regression models to show how (a) Facebook members' online activity coalesce into distinct categories of social media behavior and (b) how these participatory behaviors correlate with and predict measures of new media literacy skills. The study demonstrates the use of analytics to understand the literacies embedded in people's social media activity.

The Open University is one of the worlds largest distance learning institutions. Since tutors do not interact face to face with students, it can be difficult for tutors to identify and respond to students who are struggling in time to try to resolve the difficulty. Predictive models have been developed and tested using historic Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) activity data combined with other data sources, for three OU modules. This has revealed that it is possible to predict student failure by looking for changes in user's activity in the VLE, when compared against their own previous behaviour, or that of students who can be categorised as having similar learning behaviour. More focused analysis of these modules applying the GUHA (General Unary Hypothesis Automaton) method of data analysis has also yielded some early promising results for creating accurate hypothesis about students who fail.},

In this paper, we look at a specific data mining method, namely sequential pattern extraction, and we demonstrate an approach that exploits available linked open data for this interpretation task. Indeed, we show through a case study relying on data about students' enrolment in course modules how linked data can be used to provide a variety of additional dimensions through which the results of the data mining method can be explored, providing, at interpretation time, new input into the analytics process.},

abstract = {As MOOCs grow in popularity, the relatively low completion rates of learners has been a central criticism. This focus on completion rates, however, reflects a monolithic view of disengagement that does not allow MOOC designers to target interventions or develop adaptive course features for particular subpopulations of learners. To address this, we present a simple, scalable, and informative classification method that identifies a small number of longitudinal engagement trajectories in MOOCs. Learners are classified based on their patterns of interaction with video lectures and assessments, the primary features of most MOOCs to date.
In an analysis of three computer science MOOCs, the classifier consistently identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement. The most notable of these is the learners who stay engaged through the course without taking assessments. These trajectories are also a useful framework for the comparison of learner engagement between different course structures or instructional approaches. We compare learners in each trajectory and course across demographics, forum participation, video access, and reports of overall experience. These results inform a discussion of future interventions, research, and design directions for MOOCs. Potential improvements to the classification mechanism are also discussed, including the introduction of more fine-grained analytics.

abstract = {Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are growing substantially in numbers, and also in interest from the educational community. MOOCs offer particular challenges for what is becoming accepted as mainstream practice in learning analytics.
Partly for this reason, and partly because of the relative newness of MOOCs as a widespread phenomenon, there is not yet a substantial body of literature on the learning analytics of MOOCs. However, one clear finding is that drop-out/non-completion rates are substantially higher than in more traditional education.
This paper explores these issues, and introduces the metaphor of a 'funnel of participation' to reconceptualise the steep drop-off in activity, and the pattern of steeply unequal participation, which appear to be characteristic of MOOCs and similar learning environments. Empirical data to support this funnel of participation are presented from three online learning sites: iSpot (observations of nature), Cloudworks ('a place to share, find and discuss learning and teaching ideas and experiences'), and openED 2.0, a MOOC on business and management that ran between 2010--2012. Implications of the funnel for MOOCs, formal education, and learning analytics practice are discussed.

We explore this here by testing if scientific inquiry skill models built and validated for one science topic can predict skill demonstration for new students and a new science topic. Test cases were chosen using two methods: student-level stratification, and stratification based on the amount of trials ran during students' experimentation. We found that predictive performance of the models was different on each test set, revealing limitations that would have been missed from student-level validation alone.},

This paper presents the initial development of a systematic approach for interpreting and evaluating learner behaviors in OELEs called model-driven assessments, which uses a model of the cognitive and metacognitive processes important for completing the open-ended learning task. The model provides a means for both classifying and assessing students' learning behaviors while using the system. An evaluation of the analysis technique is presented in the context of Betty's Brain, an OELE designed to help middle school students learn about science.},

We examine, which questions are not yet supported and propose concepts of indicators that have a high potential of positively influencing teachers' didactical considerations. Our investigation shows that many questions of teachers cannot be answered with currently available research tools. Furthermore, few learning analytics studies report about measuring impact. We describe which effects learning analytics should have on teaching and discuss how this could be evaluated.}.

We focus our studies on the initial hypothesis that 3D immersive environments are highly engaging and offer an experience that goes beyond the 'traditional' online education. We want to combine different analysis methods to be able to get empirical evidence showing the students' engagement with the 3D space in ways that can help us in the design of the learning experience accompanying the learners in their journey.

Generally though the policies setting out institutional use of student data have not kept pace with this change.
Institutional policy frameworks should provide not only an enabling environment for the optimal and ethical harvesting and use of data, but also clarify: who benefits and under what conditions, establish conditions for consent and the de-identification of data, and address issues of vulnerability and harm. A directed content analysis of the policy frameworks of two large distance education institutions shows that current policy frameworks do not facilitate the provision of an enabling environment for learning analytics to fulfil its promise.

More specifically, we combine social data that has been collected from the users of three learning portals and reflect on how they should be handled. We start by studying the data types and formats that these portals use to represent and store social and usage data. Then we develop crosswalks between the different schemas, so that merged versions of the source datasets may be created. The results of this bottom-up, hands-on investigation reveal several interesting issues that need to be overcome before aggregated sets of social and usage data can be actually used to support learning analytics research or services.},

We designed a learning management system, GradeCraft, to foreground the affordances of these grading systems, and to enhance the "game-like" experience for students. Along with serving as a translation layer for the grading systems of these courses, GradeCraft is also designed with an eye towards learning analytics, and captures information that can be described as student "process" data. Currently this data includes what types of assignments students choose to complete; how students assign percentage weights to their chosen assignments; how often and how accurately students check or model their course grades; and how successfully assignments are completed by students individually and the class as a whole across a structured grading rubric.

abstract = {Personalized learning environments and learning analytics hold the promise to transform learning experiences, enhance and accelerate student success, and "open up" student learning to resources and experiences from outside individual institutions. To achieve their potential, personalized learning projects must move beyond individual, stand-alone projects or innovations to reshaping the institutional experience.
Learning science must connect with learning pedagogy and design. Learners and institutions must have access to tools and resources that assist in customizing student progress and supplemental learning needs. Teachers and faculty must be empowered to provide teaching and learning environments that allow individual students to thrive. All this will require unique partnerships and collaborations within and across institutions, incorporating the best learning science findings and bridging with public and private entities developing the learning and analytic tools to support personalized learning.
Crafting a strategy to embrace and sustain the transformative power of personalized learning systems will require strong leadership and clear planning models to align with institutional planning and future investments.

Moreover, the ability to write in a scholarly manner is a core competence, often taking the form of discourse with oneself and the literature. Computational linguistics research has developed a rich array of tools for machine interpretation of human discourse, but work to develop these tools in the context of learning is at a relatively early stage. Moreover, there is a significant difference between designing tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis, and their deployment on platforms to provide meaningful analytics for the learners and educators who are conducting that discourse. This workshop aims to catalyse ideas and build community connections among those who want to shape this field.

Also, OpenCourseware and other OER initiatives have contributed to making this ecosystem of resources richer. Very interesting insights can be extracted when studying the usage and social data that are produced within the learning collections, repositories and federations. At the same time, concerns for the quality and sustainability of these collections have been raised, which has lead to research on quality measurement and metrics. The Workshop attempts to bring studies and demonstrations for any kind of analysis done on learning resource collections, from an interdisciplinary perspective. We consider digital collections not as merely IT deployments but as social systems with contributors, owners, evaluators and users forming patterns of interactions on top of portals or through search systems embedded in other learning technology components. This is in coherence of considering these social systems under a Web Science approach (http://webscience.org/).

Then, we propose a method for formatively assessing the situation of real-world learning. The method enables us to recognize the sequence of characteristic stay behavior and the associated body posture of a learner, and to estimate the 3D location of his/her interest. The method enables the estimation of not only the learning topic that a learner is currently examining in a field but also the prospective topics that he/she should learn. Our assessment method is the basis for context-aware support to promote the emergence of new knowledge from intellectual collaboration in the world.},

Then, we propose to use data from Moodle's logs about each cluster/group of students separately in order to be able to obtain more specific and accurate models of students' behaviour. The results show that the fitness of the specific models is greater than the general model obtained using all the data, and the comprehensibility of the models can be also improved in some cases.},

The overall goal of the Customized Course Advising project is to determine the optimal term-by-term course selections for all engineering students based on their incoming characteristics and previous course history and performance, paying particular attention to concurrent enrollment. We found that ACT Math, SAT Math, and Advanced Placement exam can be effective measures to measure the students' academic preparation level.

We also explore the correlation between the time-spent factor (as defined here) and goal-expectancy. We present a case study and investigate the value of using this parameter as a learning analytics factor for improving prediction of performance during computer-based testing.

Classroom visual design has been previously studied, but not in terms of the systematic patterns adopted by teachers in selecting what materials to place on classroom walls, or in terms of the actual semantic content of what is placed on walls. This is potentially important, as classroom walls are continuously seen by students, and form a continual off-task behavior option, available to students at all times. Using the k-means clustering algorithm, we find four types of visual classroom environments (one of them an outlier within our data set), representing teachers' strategies in classroom decoration. Our results indicate that the degree to which teachers place content-related decorations on the walls, is a feature of particular importance for distinguishing which approach teachers are using. Similarly, the type of school (e.g. whether private or charter) appeared to be another significant factor in determining teachers' design choices for classroom walls. The present findings begin the groundwork to better understand the impact of teacher decisions and choices in classroom design that lead to better outcomes in terms of engagement and learning, and finally towards developing classroom designs that are more effective and engaging for learners.

Previous work in the literature has emphasised the need for and value of human meaning-making in the process of interpretation of data to transform it in to actionable intelligence.
This paper describes a programme of human Data Wranglers deployed at the Open University, UK, charged with making sense of a range of data sources related to learning, analysing that data in the light of their understanding of practice in individual faculties/departments, and producing reports that summarise the key points and make actionable recommendations.
The evaluation of and experience in this programme of work strongly supports the value of human meaning-makers in the learning analytics process, and suggests that barriers to organisational change in this area can be mitigated by embedding learning analytics work within strategic contexts, and working at an appropriate level and granularity of analysis.

Next we try to identify influential structures in the history of learners' answers considering the Markov chain of different orders.

Our analysis of MATHia's relatively coarse-grained personalization contrasts with more finegrained analysis in previous research on word problems in the Cognitive Tutor (e.g., finding effects on performance in parts of problems that depend on more difficult skills), and we explore associations of aggregate preference "honoring" with learner performance. To do so, we define a notion of "strong" learner interest area preferences and find that honoring such preferences has a small negative association with performance. However, learners that both merely express preferences (either interest area preferences or setting names of friends/classmates), and those that express strong preferences, tend to perform in ways that are associated with better learning compared to learners that do not express such preferences. We consider several explanations of these findings and suggest important topics for future research.

These qualitative interviews provided us with considerable information that helped us improve the interactions students have with the virtual manipulatives and produce more sophisticated and informative analytics. We emphasize the importance of using mixed-methods during the iterative cycles of development that define design research.

A consistent message from universities participating in MOOC delivery is their eagerness to understand students' online learning processes. This paper reports on an exploratory investigation of students' learning processes in two MOOCs which have different curriculum and assessment designs. When viewed through the lens of common MOOC learning analytics, the high level of initial student interest and, ultimately, the high level of attrition, makes these two courses appear very similar to each other, and to MOOCs in general. With the goal of developing a greater understanding of students' patterns of learning behavior in these courses, we investigated alternative learning analytic approaches and visual representations of the output of these analyses. Using these approaches we were able to meaningfully classify student types and visualize patterns of student engagement which were previously unclear. The findings from this research contribute to the educational community's understanding of students' engagement and performance in MOOCs, and also provide the broader learning analytics community with suggestions of new ways to approach learning analytic data analysis and visualization.

We conclude that the MOOC activity drops not only due to the drop-outs. When students skips around 10% of the proposed activities, the percentage of passing the course decrease in a 25%.

The ability to pinpoint students who might soon decide to drop out of a given academic program allows those in charge to not only understand the causes for this undesired outcome, but it also provides room for the development of early intervention systems. While making such inferences based on academic performance data alone is certainly possible, we claim that in many cases there is no substantial correlation between how well a student performs and his or her decision to withdraw. This is specially true when the overall set of students has a relatively similar academic performance. To address this issue, we derive measurements of engagement from students' electronic portfolios and show how these features can be effectively used to augment the quality of predictions.

Our results indicate that advisors predominantly used the EWS during their meetings with students---despite it being designed as a tool to provide information to prepare for meetings and identify students who are struggling academically. This introduction of an unintended audience brings significant design implications to bear that are relevant for learning analytics innovations.

The broader purpose is to explore the plausibility of a flexible method that is conducive to adoption and diffusion. In this respect this paper fits within the ambit of the modest computing agenda, and suggests the possibility of a modest analytics. We built both regression and index method models on 2011 student data and applied these to 2012 student data. The index method was comparable in terms of predictive accuracy of student risk. We suggest that the context specificity of learning environments makes the index method a promising tool for educators who want a situated risk algorithm that is flexible and adaptable.},

Advances in text and video analytics provide the capability of investigating students' use of the tool and the psychometrics and linguistic processes evident in their written annotations. This paper reports on a study exploring students' use of a video annotation tool when two different instructional approaches were deployed -- graded and non-graded self-reflection annotations within two courses in the performing arts. In addition to counts and temporal locations of self-reflections, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC) framework was used for the extraction of variables indicative of the linguistic and psychological processes associated with self-reflection annotations of videos. The results indicate that students in the course with graded self-reflections adopted more linguistic and psychological related processes in comparison to the course with non-graded self-reflections. In general, the effect size of the graded reflections was lower for students who took both courses in parallel. Consistent with prior research, the study identified that students tend to make the majority of their self-reflection annotations early in the video time line. The paper also provides several suggestions for future research to better understand the application of video annotations in facilitating student learning.

In this paper, in order to tackle some of these issues, we present as a proof-of-concept of a novel extension of Graasp, a social media platform, to setup a peer assessment activity. We then report a case study of peer assessment using Graasp in a Social Media course with 60 master's level university students and analyze the level of agreement between students and instructors in the evaluation of short individual reports. Finally, to see if both instructor and student evaluations were based on appearance of project reports rather than on content, we conducted a study with 40 kids who rated reports solely on their look. Our results convey the fact that unlike the kid evaluation, which shows a low level of agreement with instructors, student assessment is reliable since the level of agreement between instructors and students was high.},

We have developed and implemented a classifcation algorithm based on learners' interactions with the artifacts they create. This new form of semi-automated concept classification, coined Collaborative Spatial Classification, leverages the spatial arrangement of artifacts to provide a visualization that generates summary level data about about idea distribution. This approach has two benefits. First, students learn to identify and articulate patterns and connections among classmates ideas. Second, the teacher receives a high-level view of the distribution of ideas, enabling them to decide how to shift their instructional practices in real-time.},

Students' textual responses to short answer questions offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, automatically analyzing textual constructed responses poses significant computational challenges, and the difficulty of generating accurate assessments is exacerbated by the disfluencies that occur prominently in elementary students' writing. With robust text analytics, there is the potential to accurately analyze students' text responses and predict students' future success. In this paper, we present WriteEval, a hybrid text analytics method for analyzing student-composed text written in response to constructed response questions. Based on a model integrating a text similarity technique with a semantic analysis technique, WriteEval performs well on responses written by fourth graders in response to short-text science questions. Further, it was found that WriteEval's assessments correlate with summative analyses of student performance.

abstract = {Early Warning Systems (EWSs) are being developed and used more frequently to aggregate multiple sources of data and provide timely information to stakeholders about students in need of academic support. As these systems grow more complex, there is an increasing need to incorporate relevant and real-time course-related information that could be predictors of a student's success or failure. This paper presents an investigation of how to incorporate students' use of course resources from a Learning Management System (LMS) into an existing EWS. Specifically, we focus our efforts on understanding the relationship between course resource use and a student's final course grade. Using ten semesters of LMS data from a requisite Chemistry course, we categorized course resources into four categories. We used a multinomial logistic regression model with semester fixed-effects to estimate the relationship between course resource use and the likelihood that a student receives an "A" or "B" in the course versus a "C." Results suggest that students who use Exam Preparation or Lecture resources to a greater degree than their peers are more likely to receive an "A" or "B" as a final grade. We discuss the implications of our results for the further development of this EWS and EWSs in general.},

While our approach is substantially informed by both higher education and K-12 settings, this framework is developed to apply across all educational contexts where digital data are used to inform learners and the management of learning. Although we can identify movements that are relatively independent of each other today, we believe they will in all cases expand from their current margins to encompass larger domains and increasingly overlap. The growth in these analytic activities leads to the need to find ways to synthesize understandings, find common language, and develop frames of reference to help these movements develop into a field.},

A learning analytics intervention is defined as the surrounding frame of activity through which analytic tools, data, and reports are taken up and used. It is a soft technology that involves the orchestration of the human process of engaging with the analytics as part of the larger teaching and learning activity. This paper first makes the case for the overall importance of intervention design, situating it within the larger landscape of the learning analytics field, and then considers the specific issues of intervention design for student use of learning analytics. Four principles of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design that can be used by teachers and course developers to support the productive use of learning analytics by students are introduced: Integration, Agency, Reference Frame and Dialogue. In addition three core processes in which to engage students are described: Grounding, Goal-Setting and Reflection. These principles and processes are united in a preliminary model of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design for students, presented as a starting point for further inquiry.},

Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) addresses all of these issues, as shown in an analysis of 1,330 asynchronous messages written and self-coded by 17 students during a 13-week online educational technology course. The results showed how attributes at multiple levels (individual and message) affected knowledge creation processes. Men were more likely than women to theorize. Asynchronous messages created a micro-sequence context; opinions and asking about purpose preceded new information; anecdotes, opinions, different opinions, elaborating ideas, and asking about purpose or information preceded theorizing. These results show how informal thinking precedes formal thinking and how social metacognition affects knowledge creation.},

Using a rich knowledge building discourse dataset, in which notes' contribution types and threads' productivity have been coded, a secondary temporal analysis was conducted. In particular, Lag-sequential Analysis was conducted to identify transitional patterns among different contribution types that distinguish productive threads from "improvable" ones. Results indicated that productive inquiry threads involved significantly more transitions among questioning, theorizing, obtaining information, and working with information; in contrast, responding to questions and theories by merely giving opinions was not sufficient to achieve knowledge progress. This study highlights the importance of investigating temporality in collaborative learning and calls for attention to developing and testing temporal analysis methods in learning analytics research.

The emerging field of learning analytics is at the intersection of numerous academic disciplines, and therefore draws on a diversity of methodologies, theories and underpinning scientific assumptions. Through citation analysis and structured mapping we aimed to identify the emergence of trends and disciplinary hierarchies that are influencing the development of the field to date. The results suggest that there is some fragmentation in the major disciplines (computer science and education) regarding conference and journal representation. The analyses also indicate that the commonly cited papers are of a more conceptual nature than empirical research reflecting the need for authors to define the learning analytics space. An evaluation of the current state of learning analytics provides numerous benefits for the development of the field, such as a guide for under-represented areas of research and to identify the disciplines that may require more strategic and targeted support and funding opportunities.},

Appealing to thinkers of the Italian Renaissance, it is argued that ingenium, eloquence, and self-knowledge constitute the what, how, and why of humane education. Lastly, looking to several examples from recent learning analytics literature, it is demonstrated that learning analytics is not only helpful as set of aids for ensuring success in scientific and technical disciplines, but in the humanities as well. In order to function effectively as an aid to humane education, however, learning analytics must be embedded within a context that encourages continuous reflection, responsiveness, and personal responsibility for learning.},

This includes the different groups of people involved -- learners, educators, administrators and support staff -- the practices of those groups, their understandings of how teaching and learning take place, the technologies they use and the specific environments within which they operate. Each element of the TEL Complex requires explicit and careful consideration during the process of implementation, in order to avoid failure and maximise the chances of success. In order for learning analytics to be implemented successfully at scale, it is crucial to provide not only the analytics and their associated tools but also appropriate forms of support, training and community building.},

abstract = {This poster presents an early experimentation of applying topic modeling and visualization techniques to analyze online discourse. In particular, Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to convert discourse into a high-dimensional semantic space. To explore meaningful visualizations of the space, Locally Linear Embedding was performed reducing it to two-dimensional. Further, Time Series Analysis was applied to track evolution of topics in the space. This work will lead to new analytic tools for collaborative learning.},

In particular there is no systematic workflow for producing learning analytics tools that are both technologically feasible and truly underpin the learning experience. In this paper, we present the LATUX workflow, a five-stage workflow to design, deploy and validate awareness tools in technology-enabled learning environments. LATUX is grounded on a well-established design process for creating, testing and re-designing user interfaces. We extend this process by integrating the pedagogical requirements to generate visual analytics to inform instructors' pedagogical decisions or intervention strategies.

They found four distinct patterns of engagement that emerged from MOOCs based on videos and assessments. However, not all platforms take this approach to learning design. Courses on the FutureLearn platform are underpinned by a social-constructivist pedagogy, which includes discussion as an important element. In this paper, we analyse engagement patterns on four FutureLearn MOOCs and find that only two clusters identified previously apply in this case. Instead, we see seven distinct patterns of engagement: Samplers, Strong Starters, Returners, Mid-way Dropouts, Nearly There, Late Completers and Keen Completers. This suggests that patterns of engagement in these massive learning environments are influenced by decisions about pedagogy.

We applied linear mixed effects modeling to investigate whether the social capital accumulation interpreted through learners' centrality to course interaction networks, is influenced by the language learners use to express and communicate in two connectivist MOOCs. Interactions were distributed across the three social media, namely Twitter, blog and Facebook. Results showed that learners in a cMOOC connect easier with the individuals who use a more informal, narrative style, but still maintain a deeper cohesive structure to their communication.},}

Within higher education, our assumptions and understanding of issues surrounding student attitudes to privacy are influenced both by the apparent ease with which the public appear to share the detail of their lives and our paternalistic institutional cultures. As such, it can be easy to allow our enthusiasm for the possibilities offered by learning analytics to outweigh consideration of issues of privacy.
This paper explores issues around consent and the seemingly simple choice to allow students to opt-in or opt-out of having their data tracked. We consider how 3 providers of massive open online courses (MOOCs) inform users of how their data is used, and discuss how higher education institutions can work toward an approach which engages and more fully informs students of the implications of learning analytics on their personal data.},}

In this work we present a class of collaborative multi-regression models that are personalized to each student and also take into account features related to student's past performance, engagement and course characteristics.

Our experimental evaluation on a large set of students, courses, and activities shows that these models are capable of improving the performance prediction accuracy by over 20%.

The allowance of unlimited multiple attempts sets up a range of observed score and latent-variable approaches to scoring the constructed response homework.

Using grade distribution compared to grade point average provides better estimates as to the effect particular grades have on enrollment outcomes.

Rather, it is hypothesised that there is a skill involved in using forums to learn; that theory-informed descriptions of this skill illustrate how MOOC participants use forums differently as they progress from novice to expert; that the skill progression can be validated through the use of forum log file data; and that log file data can also be used to assess an individual MOOC participant's position in relation to this progression -- that is, to measure an individual's skill in learning through forums and similar educational settings.

This study combines different methods to develop a scalable analytic approach for a comprehensive analysis of learners' discourse in a connectivist massive open online course (cMOOC). By linking techniques for semantic annotation and graph analysis with a qualitative analysis of learner-generated discourse, we examined how social media platforms (blogs, Twitter, and Facebook) and course recommendations influence content creation and topics discussed within a cMOOC. Our findings indicate that learners tend to focus on several prominent topics that emerge very quickly in the course. They maintain that focus, with some exceptions, throughout the course, regardless of readings suggested by the instructor. Moreover, the topics discussed across different social media differ, which can likely be attributed to the affordances of different media. Finally, our results indicate a relatively low level of cohesion in the topics discussed which might be an indicator of a diversity of the conceptual coverage discussed by the course participants.},}

In addition, an advanced Hidden Nave Bayes (HNB) algorithm is coded for off-task behavior detection and to show the best performance compared with traditional modeling techniques. Implications of the study are then discussed.},}

abstract = {All forms of learning take time. There is a large body of research suggesting that the amount of time spent on learning can improve the quality of learning, as represented by academic performance. The wide-spread adoption of learning technologies such as learning management systems (LMSs), has resulted in large amounts of data about student learning being readily accessible to educational researchers. One common use of this data is to measure time that students have spent on different learning tasks (i.e., time-on-task). Given that LMS systems typically only capture times when students executed various actions, time-on-task measures are estimated based on the recorded trace data. LMS trace data has been extensively used in many studies in the field of learning analytics, yet the problem of time-on-task estimation is rarely described in detail and the consequences that it entails are not fully examined.
This paper presents the results of a study that examined the effects of different time-on-task estimation methods on the results of commonly adopted analytical models. The primary goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the issue of accuracy and appropriateness surrounding time-estimation within the broader learning analytics community, and to initiate a debate about the challenges of this process. Furthermore, the paper provides an overview of time-on-task estimation methods in educational and related research fields.},}

This study investigates this hypothesis by examining how students vary in their use of linguistic features across 16 prompt-based essays. Forty-five high school students wrote 16 essays across 8 sessions within an Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) system. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Entropy analyses were used to calculate how rigid or flexible students were in their use of narrative linguistic features over time and how this trait related to individual differences in literacy ability and essay quality. Additional analyses indicated that NLP and Entropy reliably detected narrative flexibility (or rigidity) after session 2 and was related to students' prior literacy skills. These exploratory methodologies are important for researchers and educators, as they indicate that writing flexibility is indeed a trait of strong writers and can be detected rather quickly using the combination of textual features and dynamic analyses.},}

She would first scan her students' homework and/or exams into the Ignite system via a range of multifunctional input devices. Xerox Ignite reads, interprets, and analyzes the students' work in minutes. Then the teacher can select how to view the data by choosing from numerous reports. Examples are; an "at a glance" class summary that shows who needs extra help in what areas and who is ready to move on; a "context" report showing how each skill for each student is progressing over time; a grade-level performance report that helps third-grade teachers share best practices and cluster students into learning groups; and a student feedback report that tells each student what he/she needs to improve upon. Ignite intent is also to make it easier for districts to administer, score and evaluate content based on academic goals set for schools and students. The scanning and 'mark lifting' technology embedded into Ignite reduces the time needed to correct papers and frees time for the teacher to apply detailed insights to their day-to-day instruction tasks. Critical to this function is the automated reading of student marks, including handwriting, to enable the digitization of student performance at a detailed level.

Critical realism is advanced as a philosophy of science that can help reconcile the apparent contradictions between the constructivist aims and the empirical practices of learning analytics and simultaneously can justify learning analytics' current methodological tolerance. The paper concludes that learning analytics, arrayed in realist terms, is essentially longitudinal and multimethodological, concerned with the socio-technical systems of learning and the problems of implementation, and has the potential to be emancipatory. Some methodological implications for learning analytics practice are discussed.},}

Many adaptive learning environments model students' natural language input, and there is growing recognition that these systems can be improved by leveraging multimodal cues to understand learners better. This paper investigates multimodal features related to posture and gesture for the task of classifying students' dialogue acts within tutorial dialogue. In order to accelerate the modeling process by eliminating the manual annotation bottleneck, a fully unsupervised machine learning approach is utilized for this task. The results indicate that these unsupervised models are significantly improved with the addition of automatically extracted posture and gesture information. Further, even in the absence of any linguistic features, a model that utilizes posture and gesture features alone performed significantly better than a majority class baseline. This work represents a step toward achieving better understanding of student utterances by incorporating multimodal features within adaptive learning environments. Additionally, the technique presented here is scalable to very large student datasets.},

 abstract = {Among the most important tasks of the teacher in a classroom using the Reasoning Mind blended learning system is proactive remediation: dynamically planned interventions conducted by the teacher with one or more students. While there are several examples of detectors of student behavior within an online learning environment, most have focused on behaviors occurring fully within the context of the system, and on student behaviors. In contrast, proactive remediation is a teacher-driven activity that occurs outside of the system, and its occurrence is not necessarily related to the student's current task within the Reasoning Mind system. We present a sensor-free detector of proactive remediation, which is able to distinguish these activities from other behaviors involving idle time, such as on-task conversation related to immediate learning activities and off-task behavior.},

Is this going to happen in the area of learning analytics In this paper we postulate that if changes are driven solely by a digital footprint, there is a risk of focusing only on factors that are directly connected to numeric methods. However, if the changes are complemented with an understanding about how students approach their learning, the quality of the evidence used in the redesign is significantly increased. This reasoning is illustrated with a case study in which an initial set of activities for a first year engineering course were shaped based only on the student's digital footprint. These activities were significantly modified after collecting qualitative data about the students approach to learning. We conclude the paper arguing that the interpretation of the meaning of learning analytics is improved when combined with qualitative data which reveals how and why students engaged with the learning tasks in qualitatively different ways, which together provide a more informed basis for designing learning activities.},

This yielded much higher levels of engagement and learning than are typical of open or conventional online courses. The course was further refined and offered a second time in 2014, where it was started by 76 students and completed by 22, with a much lower level of support. Comparable levels of engagement and learning were obtained, suggesting that this participatory approach to learning and assessment can indeed be managed with more typical instructor support. Nonetheless, additional automation and streamlining is called for if the model is to eventually be used in massive online courses with thousands of students or as an autonomous self-paced open course.},

Learning design establishes the objectives and pedagogical plans which can be evaluated against the outcomes captured through learning analytics. However, no empirical study is available linking learning designs of a substantial number of courses with usage of Learning Management Systems (LMS) and learning performance. Using cluster- and correlation analyses, in this study we compared how 87 modules were designed, and how this impacted (static and dynamic) LMS behavior and learning performance. Our findings indicate that academics seem to design modules with an "invisible" blueprint in their mind. Our cluster analyses yielded four distinctive learning design patterns: constructivist, assessment-driven, balanced-variety and social constructivist modules. More importantly, learning design activities strongly influenced how students were engaging online. Finally, learning design activities seem to have an impact on learning performance, in particular when modules rely on assimilative activities. Our findings indicate that learning analytics researchers need to be aware of the impact of learning design on LMS data over time, and subsequent academic performance.},

We conclude that students who use hints too early do worse than students who use hints later. However, students who use hints, at times, may perform as well as students who do not use hints. This paper makes a novel contribution showing for the first time that paying attention to the precise sequence of hints and attempts allows better prediction of students' performance, as well as to definitively show that, when we control for the number of attempts and hints, students that attempt problems before asking for hints show higher performance on the next question. This analysis shows that the pattern of hints and attempts, not just their numbers, is important.},

Few have explored the advantages of using personalized expanding intervals and scheduling systems to adapt to the knowledge levels and learning patterns of individual students. In this work, we are concerned with estimating the effects of personalized expanding intervals on improving students' long-term mastery level of skills. We developed a Personalized Adaptive Scheduling System (PASS) in ASSISTments' retention and relearning workflow. After implementing the PASS, we conducted a study to investigate the impact of personalized scheduling on long-term retention by comparing results from 97 classes in the summer of 2013 and 2014. We observed that students in PASS outperformed students in traditional scheduling systems on long-term retention performance (p = 0.0002), and that in particular, students with medium level of knowledge demonstrated reliable improvement (p = 0.0209) with an effect size of 0.27. In addition, the data we gathered from this study also helped to expose a few issues we have with the new system. These results suggest personalized knowledge retrieval schedules are more effective than fixed schedules and we should continue our future work on examining approaches to optimize PASS.},

Some universities emphasized human factors, while others attached greater importance to theoretical ones. We also found that some CS departments offered not only a CS curriculum but also an electrical engineering one, and those departments showed a tendency to have more "Architecture and Organization (AR)" related curricula. Furthermore, we found that even though "Information Assurance and Security (IAS)" has not yet become a very popular field, some universities are already offering IAS related courses.},

The experimental conditions have already been shown to be associated with differences in learning gains and design quality. Hence, one objective of this paper is to identify the behavioral practices that differed between the two experimental conditions, as this may help us better understand how the learning interventions work.

Ubiquitous Learning Log (ULL) is defined as a digital record of what learners have learned in the daily life using ubiquitous technologies. It allows learners to log their learning experiences with photos, audios, videos, location, RFID tag and sensor data, and to share and reuse ULL with others. By constructing real-world corpora which comprise of accumulated ULLs with information such as what, when, where, and how learners have learned in the real world and by analyzing them, we can support learners to learn more effectively. The proposed system will predict their future learning opportunities including their learning patterns and trends by analyzing their past ULLs. The prediction is made possible both by network analysis based on ULL information such as learners, knowledge, place and time and by learners' self-analysis using time-map. By predicting what they tend to learn next in their learning paths, it provides them with more learning opportunities. Accumulated data are so big and the relationships among the data are so complicated that it is difficult to grasp how closely the ULLs are related each other. Therefore, this paper proposes a system to help learners to grasp relationships among learners, knowledge, place and time, using network graphs and network analysis.},

By applying network analysis on the constructed transition networks, we find general transition patterns between areas of interest (AOIs) for all students, and we also compare patterns for high- and low-performing students. Our results show that even though students share general transition patterns during problem solving, high-performing students made more strategic transitions among AOI triples than low-performing students.},

 abstract = {Interest in analyses that probe the temporal aspects of learning continues to grow. The study of common and consequential sequences of events (such as learners accessing resources, interacting with other learners and engaging in self-regulatory activities) and how these are associated with learning outcomes, as well as the ways in which knowledge and skills grow or evolve over time are both core areas of interest. Learning analytics datasets are replete with fine-grained temporal data: click streams; chat logs; document edit histories (e.g. wikis, etherpads); motion tracking (e.g. eye-tracking, Microsoft Kinect), and so on. However, the emerging area of temporal analysis presents both technical and theoretical challenges in appropriating suitable techniques and interpreting results in the context of learning. The learning analytics community offers a productive focal ground for exploring and furthering efforts to address these challenges. This workshop, the fourth in a series on temporal analysis of learning, provides a focal point for analytics researchers to consider issues around and approaches to temporality in learning analytics.},

This could have substantial implications for recommending and exposing students to a variety of curricular and co-curricular pathways utilizing data sources far more nuanced than grades and achievement tests. Therefore, this workshop was aimed at: i) examining the potentials of Open Badges (including the associated data and resources) to provide new and potentially unprecedented data for analysis; ii) examining the kinds of Learning Analytics methods and techniques that could be suitable for gaining valuable insights from and/or making predictions based on the evidence (data and resources) associated with badges, and iii) connecting Open Badges communities, aiming to allow for the exchange of experiences and learning from different cultures and communities.},

Only two variables were associated with the dependent variable: Knowledge post-test duration and satisfaction with content. Building a prediction model of the dependent variable, another feature was highlighted: Total number of actions in the course website along the course.

An experimental design was used with half of the students randomly assigned to receive these interventions via email and the other half being analyzed for at-risk triggers but receiving no intervention. Pre-course surveys on student motivation [4] and prior subject matter knowledge were conducted, and students were asked to maintain weekly logs of their activity online and offline connected to the courses. Regression analyses, incorporating feature selection methods to account for student demographic data, were used to compare the impact of the interventions between the control and experimental groups. Results showed that the interventions were associated with a higher final grade in one course, but only for a particular demographic group.},

We implemented the FTLS as an iOS application and confirmed that the software can be utilized to monitor learners' attitudes.

Gestures play an important role in teacher-student classroom interactions. In the domain of education, many research projects have focused on the study of such gestures either in real classrooms or in tutorial settings with experienced teachers. Novice teachers especially need to understand the messages they are sending through nonverbal communication as this can have a major effect on their ability to manage behaviors and deliver content. Such learning should optimally occur before experiencing the real classroom. To assist in this process, we have developed a virtual classroom environment- TeachLivE- and used it for teacher practice, reflection and assessment. This paper investigates the way teachers use gestures in the virtual classroom settings of TeachLivE. Biology and algebra teachers were evaluated in our study. Analysis of video recordings from real and virtual environment seems to indicate that algebra teachers gesture significantly more often than biology teachers. These results have implications for providing useful feedback to participant teachers.

 abstract = {Cognitive disequilibrium has received significant attention for its role in fostering student learning in intelligent tutoring systems and in complex learning environments. In this paper, we both add to and extend this discussion by analyzing the emergence of four affective states associated with disequilibrium: joy, surprise, neutrality and confusion; in a collaborative hands-on, engineering design task. Specifically, we conduct a comparison between two learning strategies to make salient how the strategies are associated with different affective states. This comparison is grounded in the construction of a probabilistic model of student affective state as defined by the frequency of each state, and the rate of transition between affective states. Through this comparison we confirm prior research that highlights the importance of confusion as a marker of knowledge construction, but put to question the notion that surprise is a significant mediator of cognitive disequilibrium. Overall, we show how modeling learner affect is useful for understanding and improving learning in complex, hands-on learning environments.},

In this poster we present an investigation of how students interpret feedback delivered via learning analytics dashboards. The findings indicated that most students were able to articulate an interpretation of the feedback presented through the dashboard to identify gaps between their expected and actual performance to inform changes to their study strategies. However, there was also evidence of uncertain interpretation both in terms of the format of the visualization of the feedback and their inability to understand the connection between the feedback and their current strategies. The findings have been used to inform recommendations for ways to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of feedback through dashboards to provide value to students in developing effective learning strategies to meet their educational goals.},

Automatic analysis of students' reflective writing holds great promise for providing adaptive real time support for students. This paper proposes a method based on topic modeling techniques for the task of themes exploration and reflection grade prediction. We evaluated this method on a sample of journal writings from pre-service teachers. The topic modeling method was able to discover the important themes and patterns emerged in students' reflection journals. Weekly topic relevance and word count were identified as important indicators of their journal grades. Based on the patterns discovered by topic modeling, prediction models were developed to automate the assessing and grading of reflection journals. The findings indicate the potential of topic modeling in serving as an analytic tool for teachers to explore and assess students' reflective thoughts in written journals.},

Identifying student patterns related to course completion may help to develop interventions that can improve retention and learning outcomes in MOOCs. Previous research predicting MOOC completion has focused on click-stream data, student demographics, and natural language processing (NLP) analyses. However, most of these analyses have not taken full advantage of the multiple types of data available. This study combines click-stream data and NLP approaches to examine if students' on-line activity and the language they produce in the online discussion forum is predictive of successful class completion. We study this analysis in the context of a subsample of 320 students who completed at least one graded assignment and produced at least 50 words in discussion forums, in a MOOC on educational data mining. The findings indicate that a mix of click-stream data and NLP indices can predict with substantial accuracy (78%) whether students complete the MOOC. This predictive power suggests that student interaction data and language data within a MOOC can help us both to understand student retention in MOOCs and to develop automated signals of student success.},

We looked at the problem of coding discussion transcripts for the levels of cognitive presence, one of the three main constructs in the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model of distance education. Using Coh-Metrix and LIWC features, together with a set of custom features developed to capture discussion context, we developed a random forest classification system that achieved 70.3% classification accuracy and 0.63 Cohen's kappa, which is significantly higher than values reported in the previous studies. Besides improvement in classification accuracy, the developed system is also less sensitive to overfitting as it uses only 205 classification features, which is around 100 times less features than in similar systems based on bag-of-words features. We also provide an overview of the classification features most indicative of the different phases of cognitive presence that gives an additional insights into the nature of cognitive presence learning cycle. Overall, our results show great potential of the proposed approach, with an added benefit of providing further characterization of the cognitive presence coding scheme.},

In an effort towards delivering personalized learning experience to the learners, this study aims to discover potentially useful knowledge from learners' reading and question answering records in the Reading Battle system, by applying association rule mining and clustering analysis. The results show that learners could be grouped into three clusters based on their self-reported reading habits. The rules mined from different learner clusters can be used to develop personalized recommendations to the learners. Implications of the results on evaluating and further improving the Reading Battle system are also discussed.},

This aims to help improve the accuracy of the learner model by taking into account student viewpoints on their learning, while also promoting learner reflection on their learning as part of a discussion of the content of their learner model. This aligns well with recent calls for learning analytics for learners. Building on previous research showing that learners will use open learner models, we here investigate their initial reactions to open learner model features to identify the likelihood of uptake in contexts where an open learner model is offered on an optional basis. We focus on university students' perceptions of a range of visualisations and their stated preferences for a facility to view evidence for the learner model data and to propose changes to the values.},

Particularly, educational research shows that individual differences play a significant role in explaining students' learning process. However, limited empirical research in learning analytics has investigated the role of theoretical constructs, such as motivational factors, that are underlying the observed differences between individuals. In this work, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effect of three designed learning analytics visualizations on students' participation in online discussions in authentic course settings. Using hierarchical linear mixed models, our results revealed that effects of visualizations on the quantity and quality of messages posted by students with differences in achievement goal orientations could either be positive or negative.

Much is known about its contribution to learning, but still investigating a process of collaboration remains a challenge. This paper approaches the investigation on collaborative learning from a psychophysiological perspective. An experiment was set up to explore whether biosensors can play a role in analysing collaborative learning. On the one hand, we identified five physiological coupling indices (PCIs) found in the literature: 1) Signal Matching (SM), 2) Instantaneous Derivative Matching (IDM), 3) Directional Agreement (DA), 4) Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and the 5) Fisher's z-transform (FZT) of the PCC. On the other hand, three collaborative learning measurements were used: 1) collaborative will (CW), 2) collaborative learning product (CLP) and 3) dual learning gain (DLG). Regression analyses showed that out of the five PCIs, IDM related the most to CW and was the best predictor of the CLP. Meanwhile, DA predicted DLG the best. These results play a role in determining informative collaboration measures for designing a learning analytics, biofeedback dashboard.},

While this allows flexibility of use, this could also result in misaligned practice, and there are calls for more explicit pedagogical models in learning analytics. This paper presents an explicit pedagogical model, the Team and Self Diagnostic Learning (TSDL) framework, in the context of collaborative inquiry tasks. Key informing theories include experiential learning, collaborative learning, and the learning analytics process model. The framework was trialed through a teamwork competency awareness program for 14 year old students. A total of 272 students participated in the program. This paper foregrounds students' and teachers' evaluative accounts of the program. Findings reveal positive perceptions of the stages of the TSDL framework, despite identified challenges, which points to its potential usefulness for teaching and learning. The TSDL framework aims to provide theoretical clarity of the learning process, and foster alignment between learning analytics and the learning design. The current work provides trial outcomes of a teamwork competency awareness program that used dispositional analytics, and further efforts are underway to develop the discourse layer of the analytic engine. Future work will also be dedicated to application and refinement of the framework for other contexts and participants, both learners and teachers alike.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM) has somewhat stagnated recently, and in some prominent cases even been reversed following concerns by governments, stakeholders and civil rights groups about privacy and ethics applied to the handling of personal data. In this ongoing discussion, fears and realities are often indistinguishably mixed up, leading to an atmosphere of uncertainty among potential beneficiaries of Learning Analytics, as well as hesitations among institutional managers who aim to innovate their institution's learning support by implementing data and analytics with a view on improving student success. In this paper, we try to get to the heart of the matter, by analysing the most common views and the propositions made by the LA community to solve them. We conclude the paper with an eight-point checklist named DELICATE that can be applied by researchers, policy makers and institutional managers to facilitate a trusted implementation of Learning Analytics.},

Learning analytics enable us to identify and understand such discrepancies and, in future, could be used to focus interventions to improve retention of disabled students. An agenda for onward research, focused on Critical Learning Paths, is outlined. This paper is intended to stimulate a wider interest in the potential benefits of learning analytics for institutions as they try to assure the accessibility of their e-learning and provision of support for disabled students.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development and evaluation of an affect-aware intelligent support component that is part of a learning environment known as iTalk2Learn. The intelligent support component is able to tailor feedback according to a student's affective state, which is deduced both from speech and interaction. The affect prediction is used to determine which type of feedback is provided and how that feedback is presented (interruptive or non-interruptive). The system includes two Bayesian networks that were trained with data gathered in a series of ecologically-valid Wizard-of-Oz studies, where the effect of the type of feedback and the presentation of feedback on students' affective states was investigated. This paper reports results from an experiment that compared a version that provided affect-aware feedback (affect condition) with one that provided feedback based on performance only (non-affect condition). Results show that students who were in the affect condition were less bored and less off-task, with the latter being statically significant. Importantly, students in both conditions made learning gains that were statistically significant, while students in the affect condition had higher learning gains than those in the non-affect condition, although this result was not statistically significant in this study's sample. Taken all together, the results point to the potential and positive impact of affect-aware intelligent support.},

Although generally successful in providing accurate scores, a common criticism of these systems is their lack of personalization and adaptive instruction. In particular, these systems tend to place the strongest emphasis on delivering accurate scores, and therefore, tend to overlook additional indices that may contribute to students' success, such as their affective states during writing practice. This study takes an initial step toward addressing this gap by building a predictive model of students' affect using information that can potentially be collected by computer systems. We used individual difference measures, text indices, and keystroke analyses to predict engagement and boredom in 132 writing sessions. The results suggest that these three categories of indices were successful in modeling students' affective states during writing. Taken together, indices related to students' academic abilities, text properties, and keystroke logs were able classify high and low engagement and boredom in writing sessions with accuracies between 76.5% and 77.3%. These results suggest that information readily available in writing training systems can inform affect detectors and ultimately improve student models within intelligent tutoring systems.},

This paper presents an analysis of current research exploring learning analytics associated with the use of surface devices. We use a framework to analyse our first-hand experiences, and the small number of related deployments according to four dimensions: the orchestration aspects involved; the phases of the pedagogical practice that are supported; the target actors; and the levels of iteration of the LA process. The contribution of the paper is twofold: 1) a synthesis of conclusions that identify the degree of maturity, challenges and pedagogical opportunities of the existing applications of learning analytics and interactive surfaces; and 2) an analysis framework that can be used to characterise the design space of similar areas and LA applications.},

To facilitate evaluation of learning, we propose to use randomized reference questions. We illustrate application of survival analysis and learning curves for declarative knowledge.

However, in the case of (often, half-improvised) teaching in face-to-face classrooms, such interventions would require first an understanding of what the teacher actually did, as the starting point for teacher reflection and inquiry. Currently, such teacher enactment characterization requires costly manual coding by researchers. This paper presents a case study exploring the potential of machine learning techniques to automatically extract teaching actions during classroom enactment, from five data sources collected using wearable sensors (eye-tracking, EEG, accelerometer, audio and video). Our results highlight the feasibility of this approach, with high levels of accuracy in determining the social plane of interaction (90%, ?=0.8). The reliable detection of concrete teaching activity (e.g., explanation vs. questioning) accurately still remains challenging (67%, ?=0.56), a fact that will prompt further research on multimodal features and models for teaching activity extraction, as well as the collection of a larger multimodal dataset to improve the accuracy and generalizability of these methods.},

Although learning analytics itself is an interdisciplinary field, it tends to take a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to the collection, measurement, and reporting of data, overlooking disciplinary knowledge practices. In line with a recent trend in higher education research, this paper considers the contribution of a realist sociology of education to the field of learning analytics, drawing on findings from recent student focus groups at an Australian university. It examines what learners say about their data needs with reference to organizing principles underlying knowledge practices within their disciplines. The key contribution of this paper is a framework that could be used as the basis for aligning the provision and/or use of data in relation to curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment with disciplinary knowledge practices. The framework extends recent research in Legitimation Code Theory, which understands disciplinary differences in terms of the principles that underpin knowledge-building. The preliminary analysis presented here both provides a tool for ensuring a fit between learning analytics practices and disciplinary practices and standards for achievement, and signals disciplinarity as an important consideration in learning analytics practices.},

Five distinct factors were identified from a factor analysis of the results: Culture; Data Management Expertise; Data Analysis Expertise; Communication and Policy Application; and, Training. Data were analyzed using both the role of those completing the survey and the Carnegie classification of the institutions as lenses. Generally, information technology professionals and institutions classified as Research Universities--Very High research activity had significantly different scores on the identified factors. Working within a framework of organizational learning, this paper details the concept of readiness as a reflective process, as well as how the implementation and application of analytics should be done so with ethical considerations in mind.

The number of views and votes threads received were tested to see if they helped classification. Results showed that content-related posts in the statistics MOOC had distinct linguistic features which appeared to be unrelated to the subject-matter domain; the linguistic model demonstrated good cross-course reliability (all recall and precision > .77) and was useful across all time segments of the courses; number of views and votes were not helpful for classification.},

To that end, we analyse a network of forum users based on information-giving relations extracted from the forum data. Connection patterns that appear in the information exchange network of forum users are used to define specific user roles in a social context. Semantic roles are derived by identifying thematic areas in which an actor seeks for information (problem areas) and the areas of interest in which an actor provides information to others (expertise). The interplay of social and semantic roles is analysed using a socio-semantic blockmodelling approach. The results show that social and semantic roles are not strongly interdependent. This indicates that communication patterns and interests of users develop simultaneously only to a moderate extent. In addition to the case study, the methodological contribution is in combining traditional blockmodelling with semantic information to characterise participant roles.},

This paper examined a MOOC for its potential to develop social processes. As it is exceedingly difficult to establish a relationship with somebody who seldom accesses a MOOC discussion, we singled out a cohort defined by its participants' regularity of forum presence. The study, analysed this 'cohort' and its development, in comparison to the entire MOOC learner network. Mixed methods of social network analysis (SNA), content analysis and statistical network modelling, revealed the potential for unfolding social processes among a more persistent group of learners in the MOOC setting.},

As such, reflecting writing is attracting substantial interest from universities concerned with experiential learning, reflective practice, and developing a holistic conception of the learner. However, reflective writing is for many students a novel genre to compose in, and tutors may be inexperienced in its assessment. While these conditions set a challenging context for automated solutions, natural language processing may also help address the challenge of providing real time, formative feedback on draft writing. This paper reports progress in designing a writing analytics application, detailing the methodology by which informally expressed rubrics are modelled as formal rhetorical patterns, a capability delivered by a novel web application. This has been through iterative evaluation on an independently human-annotated corpus, showing improvements from the first to second version.

abstract = {This paper explores a longitudinal approach to combining engagement, performance and social connectivity data from a MOOC using the framework of exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The idea is to model the social network in the discussion forum in a given week not only using performance (assignment scores) and overall engagement (lecture and discussion views) covariates within that week, but also on the same person-level covariates from adjacent previous and subsequent weeks. We find that over all eight weekly sessions, the social networks constructed from the forum interactions are relatively sparse and lack the tendency for preferential attachment. By analyzing data from the second week, we also find that individuals with higher performance scores from current, previous, and future weeks tend to be more connected in the social network. Engagement with lectures had significant but sometimes puzzling effects on social connectivity. However, the relationships between social connectivity, performance, and engagement weakened over time, and results were not stable across weeks.},

This study used the experience sampling methodology to capture the information that is needed to detail the communication and affective experiences of advanced English language learners. The collected data reveals differences in how English language learners perceived their communication success based on their learning context, with higher levels of communicative success experienced in formal learning settings. No such differences were found for learners', highly negative, affect. The data suggest a need for additional emotional support within formal and informal learning environments as well as a need for oral communication support within informal contexts.},

These systems are designed to assist with targeted student support in order to improve student retention. They also require considerable human and capital resources to implement, with significant costs involved. It is therefore an imperative that the systems can demonstrate quantifiable financial benefits to the institution. The purpose of this paper is to report on the financial implications of implementing an EAS at an Australian university as a case study. The case study institution implemented an EAS in 2011 using data generated from a data warehouse. The data set is comprised of 16,124 students enrolled between 2011 and 2013. Using a treatment effects approach, the study found that the cost of a student discontinuing was on average $4,687. Students identified by the EAS remained enrolled for longer, with the institution benefiting with approximately an additional $4,004 in revenue per student over the length of enrolment. All schools had a significant positive effect associated with the EAS and the EAS showed significant value to the institution regardless of the timing when the student was identified. The results indicate that EAS had significant financial benefits to this institution and that the benefits extended to the entire institution beyond the first year of enrolment.},

We have compiled the principal classroom related emotions and developed a two-phase inquiry process to: verify the possibility to measure students' emotions in classroom; discover how emotions can be displayed to promote self-reflection; and confirm the impact of emotions on learning performance. Our results suggest that students' emotions in class are related to evaluation marks.

Recently, the concept of open learning analytics (OLA) has received a great deal of attention from LA community, due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. A key challenge in OLA is to follow a personalized and goal-oriented LA model that tailors the LA task to the needs and goals of multiple stakeholders. Current implementations of LA rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators. There is, however, a need to adopt a personalized LA approach that engages end users in the indicator definition process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining the indicators that help them achieve their goals. In this paper, we address the challenge of personalized LA and present the conceptual, design, and implementation details of a rule-based indicator definition tool to support flexible definition and dynamic generation of indicators to meet the needs of different stakeholders with diverse goals and questions in the LA exercise.},

In this paper, we report on the results from an alternative approach for dynamic student behavioral modeling based on the analysis of time-based student-generated trace data. The goal was to unobtrusively classify students according to their time-spent behavior. We applied 5 different supervised learning classification algorithms on these data, using as target values (class labels) the students' performance score classes during a Computer-Based Assessment (CBA) process, and compared the obtained results. The proposed approach has been explored in a study with 259 undergraduate university participant students. The analysis of the findings revealed that a) the low misclassification rates are indicative of the accuracy of the applied method and b) the ensemble learning (treeBagger) method provides better classification results compared to the others. These preliminary results are encouraging, indicating that a time-spent driven description of the students' behavior could have an added value towards dynamically reshaping the respective models.},

The paper at hand proposes the usage of an A/B testing framework that is able to be used within an micro-service architecture to validate hypotheses about how learners use the platform and to enable data-driven decisions about new features and settings. To evaluate this framework three new features (Onboarding Tour, Reminder Mails and a Pinboard Digest) have been identified based on a user survey. They have been implemented and introduced on two large MOOC platforms and their influence on the learners behavior have been measured. Finally this paper proposes a data driven decision workflow for the introduction of new features and settings on e-learning platforms.},

In this regard social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as one of the cornerstones of learning analytics methodologies. However, despite the noted importance of social networks for facilitating the learning process, it remains unclear how and to what extent such network measures are associated with specific learning outcomes. Motivated by Simmel's theory of social interactions and building on the argument that social centrality does not always imply benefits, this study aimed to further contribute to the understanding of the association between students' social centrality and their academic performance. The study reveals that learning analytics research drawing on SNA should incorporate both - descriptive and statistical methods to provide a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of a students' network position. In so doing researchers can undertake more nuanced and contextually salient inferences about learning in network settings. Specifically, we show how differences in the factors framing students' interactions within two instances of a MOOC affect the association between the three social network centrality measures (i.e., degree, closeness, and betweenness) and the final course outcome.},

The proposed framework incorporates various types of analytics, with the teacher playing a key role in bringing context to the analysis and making decisions on the feedback provided to students as well as the scaffolding and adaptation of the learning design. The framework consists of five dimensions: temporal analytics, tool-specific analytics, cohort dynamics, comparative analytics and contingency. Specific metrics and visualisations are defined for each dimension of the conceptual framework. Finally the development of a tool that partially implements the conceptual framework is discussed.},

In order to do so, we need to understand what successful patterns look like when reflected in data and subsequently adjust the course design to avoid unsuccessful patterns and facilitate successful patterns.
However, when establishing these successful patterns, it is important to account for individual differences among students since previous research has shown that not all students engage with learning resources to the same extent. Regulation strategies seem to play an important role in explaining the different usage patterns students' display when using digital learning recourses. When learning analytics research incorporates contextualized data about student regulation strategies we are able to differentiate between students at a more granular level.
The current study examined if regulation strategies could account for differences in the use of various learning resources. It examines how students regulated their learning process and subsequently used the different learning resources throughout the course and established how this use contributes to course performance.
The results show that students with different regulation strategies use the learning resources to the same extent. However, the use of learning resources influences course performance differently for different groups of students. This paper recognizes the importance of contextualization of learning data resources with a broader set of indicators to understand the learning process. With our focus on differences between students, we strive for a shift within learning analytics from identifying at risk students towards a contribution of learning analytics in the educational design process and enhance the quality of learning; for all students.},

abstract = {Despite the prevalence of e-learning systems in schools, most of today's systems do not personalize educational data to the individual needs of each student. This paper proposes a new algorithm for sequencing questions to students that is empirically shown to lead to better performance and engagement in real schools when compared to a baseline approach. It is based on using knowledge tracing to model students' skill acquisition over time, and to select questions that advance the student's learning within the range of the student's capabilities, as determined by the model. The algorithm is based on a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model that incorporates partial credit scores, reasoning about multiple attempts to solve problems, and integrating item difficulty. This model is shown to outperform other BKT models that do not reason about (or reason about some but not all) of these features. The model was incorporated into a sequencing algorithm and deployed in two classes in different schools where it was compared to a baseline sequencing algorithm that was designed by pedagogical experts. In both classes, students using the BKT sequencing approach solved more difficult questions and attributed higher performance than did students who used the expert-based approach. Students were also more engaged using the BKT approach, as determined by their interaction time and number of log-ins to the system, as well as their reported opinion. We expect our approach to inform the design of better methods for sequencing and personalizing educational content to students that will meet their individual learning needs.},

Using four different datasets we study the relationship between the error coming from fitting the parameters and the difficulty index of the skills and the effect of the size of the dataset in this relationship. The relationship between the fitting error and the difficulty index can be very easy modeled and might be indicating some problems with BKTs performance. However, large datasets are required to clearly see this connection as there is an important sample size effect.},

The student models that drive the "outer loop" of Intelligent Tutoring Systems typically do not represent or track misconceptions. Here, we present a method of representing misconceptions in the Knowledge Component models, or Q-Matrices, that are used by student models to estimate latent knowledge. We show, in a case study on a fraction arithmetic dataset, that incorporating a misconception into the Knowledge Component model dramatically improves the overall model's fit to data. We also derive qualitative insights from comparing predicted learning curves across models that incorporate varying misconception-related parameters. Finally, we show that the inclusion of a misconception in the Knowledge Component model can yield individual student estimates of misconception strength that are significantly correlated with out-of-tutor measures of student errors.},

The Experience API (xAPI) alongside the development of user specific record stores has been touted as a means to address this challenge, but a number of subtle considerations must be made when using xAPI in Learning Analytics. This paper provides a general overview to the complexities and challenges of using xAPI in a general systemic analytics solution - called the Connected Learning Analytics (CLA) toolkit. The importance of design is emphasised, as is the notion of common vocabularies and xAPI Recipes. Early decisions about vocabularies and structural relationships between statements can serve to either facilitate or handicap later analytics solutions. The CLA toolkit case study provides us with a way of examining both the strengths and the weaknesses of the current xAPI specification, and we conclude with a proposal for how xAPI might be improved by using JSON-LD to formalise Recipes in a machine readable form.},

Compared to simple benchmarks based on demographics, we find that a machine learning prediction model can learn from unstructured text to predict which students will complete an online course. We show that the model performs well out-of-sample, compared to a standard array of demographics.

Such an association suggests a causal interpretation--more doing yields better learning--which requires randomized experimentation to most rigorously confirm. But such experiments are expensive, and any single experiment in a particular course context does not provide rigorous evidence that the causal link will generalize to other course content. We suggest that analytics of increasingly available online learning data sets can complement experimental efforts by facilitating more widespread evaluation of the generalizability of claims about what learning methods produce better student learning outcomes. We illustrate with analytics that narrow in on a causal interpretation of the doer effect by showing that doing within a course unit predicts learning of that unit content more than doing in units before or after. We also provide generalizability evidence across four different courses involving over 12,500 students that the learning effect of doing is about six times greater than that of reading.},

In order to evaluate whether to attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus persistent characteristics of the students, we adopted two approaches. First, we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit a similar level of involvement in other course activities. Second, we explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking behaviors across weeks. The results of both analyses support the attribution of the effect to the behavioral interpretation. A further analysis using LDA applied to course materials suggests that more social oriented topics triggered richer discussion than more biopsychology oriented topics.},

We conclude that this method of studying eye fixation patterns can identify different types of learners with respect to cognitive activities and academic potentials, allowing educators to understand how their instructional design using online learning environments can stimulate higher-order cognitive activities.},

In our previous works, we employed eye-tracking methods to quantify learners' With-me-ness and showed that it is positively correlated with their learning gains. In this contribution, we describe a tool that is designed to improve With-me-ness by providing a visual-aid superimposed on the video. The position of the visual-aid is suggested by the teachers' dialogue and deixis, and it is displayed when the learner's With-me-ness is under the average value, which is computed from the other students' gaze behavior. We report on a user-study that examines the effectiveness of the proposed tool. The results show that it significantly improves the learning gain and it significantly increases the extent to which the students follow the teacher. Finally, we demonstrate how With-me-ness can create a complete theoretical framework for conducting gaze-based learning analytics in the context of MOOCs.},

However, the potential impact from these techniques is increased when properly contextualized within a learning environment. More studies are needed to explore the connection between student interactions, approaches to learning, and academic performance. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is defined as the extent to which a student is able to motivationally, metacognitively, and cognitively engage in a learning experience. SRL has been the focus of research in traditional classroom learning and is also argued to play a vital role in the online or blended learning contexts. In this paper, we study how SRL affects students' online interactions with various learning activities and its influence in academic performance. The results derived from a naturalistic experiment among a cohort of first year engineering students showed that positive self-regulated strategies (PSRS) and negative self-regulated strategies (NSRS) affected both the interaction with online activities and academic performance. NSRS directly predicted academic outcomes, whereas PSRS only contributed indirectly to academic performance via the interactions with online activities. These results point to concrete avenues to promote self-regulation among students in this type of learning contexts.},

When controlled randomization is present in the learning platform, such as randomized ordering of problems within a problem set, natural quasi-randomized controlled studies can be conducted, post-hoc. Difficulty and learning gain attribution are among factors of interest that can be studied with secondary analyses under these conditions. However, much of the content that we might like to evaluate for learning value is not administered as a random stimulus to students but instead is being self-selected, such as a student choosing to seek help in the discussion forums, wiki pages, or other pedagogically relevant material in online courseware. Help seekers, by virtue of their motivation to seek help, tend to be the ones who have the least knowledge. When presented with a cohort of students with a bi-modal or uniform knowledge distribution, this can present problems with model interpretability when a single point estimation is used to represent cohort prior knowledge. Since resource access is indicative of a low knowledge student, a model can tend towards attributing the resources with low or negative learning gain in order to better explain performance given the higher average prior point estimate. In this paper we present several individualized prior strategies and demonstrate how learning efficacy attribution validity and prediction accuracy improve as a result. Level of education attained, relative past assessment performance, and the prior per student cold start heuristic were employed and compared as prior knowledge individualization strategies.},

Using this prior analysis, alongside Survival Analysis techniques for analyzing time-series data and drop-out rates, we explored players' gameplay patterns to help us understand player dropout in Quantum Spectre.

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the results of a study of students' academic performance in first year general education courses. Using data from 566 students who received intensive academic advising as part of their enrollment in the institution's pre-major/general education program, we investigate individual student, organizational, and disciplinary factors that might predict a students' potential classification in an Early Warning System as well as factors that predict improvement and decline in their academic performance. Disciplinary course type (based on Biglan's [7] typology) was significantly related to a student's likelihood to enter below average performance classifications. Students were the most likely to enter a classification in fields like the natural science, mathematics, and engineering in comparison to humanities courses. We attribute these disparities in academic performance to disciplinary norms around teaching and assessment. In particular, the timing of assessments played a major role in students' ability to exit a classification. Implications for the design of Early Warning analytics systems as well as academic course planning in higher education are offered.},

While many of these proposed methods have yielded success, defining and refining hierarchies of skill relationships are often difficult tasks. The relationship between skills in a graph could either be causal, therefore, a prerequisite relationship (skill A must be learned before skill B). The relationship may be non-causal, in which case the ordering of skills does not matter and may indicate that both skills are prerequisites of another skill. In this study, we propose a simple, effective method of determining the strength of pre-to-post-requisite skill relationships. We then compare our results with a teacher-level survey about the strength of the relationships of the observed skills and find that the survey results largely confirm our findings in the data-driven approach.},

abstract = {The pervasive collection of data has opened the possibility for educational institutions to use analytics methods to improve the quality of the student experience. However, the adoption of these methods faces multiple challenges particularly at the course level where instructors and students would derive the most benefit from the use of analytics and predictive models. The challenge lies in the knowledge gap between how the data is captured, processed and used to derive models of student behavior, and the subsequent interpretation and the decision to deploy pedagogical actions and interventions by instructors. Simply put, the provision of learning analytics alone has not necessarily led to changing teaching practices. In order to support pedagogical change and aid interpretation, this paper proposes a model that can enable instructors to readily identify subpopulations of students to provide specific support actions. The approach was applied to a first year course with a large number of students. The resulting model classifies students according to their predicted exam scores, based on indicators directly derived from the learning design.},

Yet an ecosystem rich in services but lacking a common approach to measuring learning activity will find data collection, aggregation and analysis time-consuming and costly. The IMS Caliper Analytics specification addresses the need for data and semantic interoperability by providing an extensible information model, controlled vocabularies and an API for instrumenting learning applications and systems that log learning events. However, many learning activities have yet to be modeled by the Caliper working group. Engaging the SoLAR community directly in this effort will help ensure that the needs of researchers and other consumers of learning analytics data will inform future versions of the specification. The LAK16 Caliper workshop is being offered with this goal in mind. The half-day session, facilitated by members of Team Caliper, will provide LAK16 participants with an opportunity to extend the Caliper specification by modeling new learning activity profiles. New profiles, new connections and new friendships are expected outcomes.},

abstract = {Despite the mounting evidence supporting the role that goal setting has on the learning process, there seems to be only a handful of studies that directly investigate goal setting in the context of Learning Analytics (LA). Although investigations have incorporated elements of goal setting, the attention afforded to theory and operationalization have been modest. In this workshop we plan to position goal setting at the forefront of LA research. The workshop will serve as a venue to bring together researchers interested in advancing Goal Setting (GS) research in the LA field. Topics include: (1) GS theory and measurement; (2) analysis and visualization of GS data; (3) strategies for integrating GS in the learning experience; and (4) implementation of GS technologies. Participants who need tools to execute their GS ideas and those who already have tools and are exploring better ways to integrate a goal setting feature can gain a lot from this workshop. Moreover, participants will have the opportunity to contribute to the conceptualization and staging of GS ideas in LA research.},

The goal of the analysis is to make student thinking visible in order to (a) better understand how students learn multiplication and division, and (b) provide feedback to teachers, e.g., about strategies students use to solve problems. Student work from a five-week trial in a third grade class provides a corpus for development and evaluation of the machine analysis routines.

We found that the most common reported MOOC emotion was Hope followed by Enjoyment and Contentment. There were substantial shifts in affective states over the course, notably with Anxiety and Pride. The most valuable result of our study is a preliminary description of the methods for collecting self-reported student affect at scale in a MOOC setting.},

The query was run in five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dashboard design options.},

Building on a new conceptual model developed by the Open University UK (OU), we will analyse three case-studies of evidence-based interventions. By working with 90+ large-scale modules for a period of two years across the five faculties and disciplines within the OU, Analytics4Action provides a bottom-up-approach for working together with key stakeholders within their respective contexts. Using principles of embedded case-study approaches by Yin [1], by comparing the learning behavior, satisfaction and performance of 11079 learners the findings indicated that each of the three learning designs led to satisfied students and average to good student retention. In the second part we highlighted that the three module teams made in-presentation interventions based upon real-time analytics, whereby initial user data indicated VLE behaviour in line with expectations. In 2-5 years, we hope that a rich, robust evidence-base will be presented to show how learning analytics can help teachers to make informed, timely and successful interventions that will help learners to achieve their learning outcomes.},

While students make exercises on the tablet this technology displays real-time data of learner performance in a teacher dashboard (extracted analytics). At the same time, learner performance is used to adaptively adjust exercises to students' progress (embedded analytics). This quasiexperimental study compares the development of students' arithmetic skills over one schoolyear (grade 2 and 4) in a traditional paper based setting to learning with the adaptive educational technology Snappet. The results indicate that students in the Snappet condition make significantly more progress on arithmetic skills in grade 4. Moreover, in this grade students with a high ability level, benefit the most from working with this adaptive educational technology. Overall the development pattern of students with different abilities was more divergent in the AET condition compared to the control condition. These results indicate that adaptive educational technologies combining extracted and embedded learning analytics are indeed creating new education scenarios that contribute to personalized learning in primary education.},

 Abstract = {In 2011, the phenomenon of MOOCs had swept the world of education and put online education in the focus of the public discourse around the world. Although researchers were excited with the vast amounts of MOOC data being collected, the benefits of this data did not stand to the expectations due to several challenges. The analyses of MOOC data are very time-consuming and labor-intensive, and require and require a highly advanced set of technical skills, often not available to the education researchers. Because of this MOOC data analyses are rarely done before the courses end, limiting the potential of data to impact the student learning outcomes and experience.

In this paper we introduce MOOCito (MOOC intervention tool), a user-friendly software platform for the analysis of MOOC data, that focuses on conducting data-informed instructional interventions and course experimentations. We cover important design principles behind MOOCito and provide an overview of the trends in MOOC research leading to its development. Although a work-in-progress, in this paper, we outline the prototype of MOOCito and the results of a user evaluation study that focused on system's perceived usability and ease-of-use. The results of the study are discussed, as well as their practical implications.}

The presented method proposes a solution in the absence of data from previous courses, which are usually used for training machine learning models. This situation typically occurs in new courses. We present the concept of a "self-learner" that builds the machine learning models from the data generated during the current course. The approach utilises information about already submitted assessments, which introduces the problem of imbalanced data for training and testing the classification models.

There are three main contributions of this paper: (1) the concept of training the models for identifying at-risk students using data from the current course, (2) specifying the problem as a classification task, and (3) tackling the challenge of imbalanced data, which appears both in training and testing data.

The results show the comparison with the traditional approach of learning the models from the legacy course data, validating the proposed concept.}

 Abstract = {It is difficult for a student to succeed in a course without access to course materials and assignments; and yet, some students delay up to a month in obtaining access to these essential materials. Students delay buying material required for their course due to multiple reasons. Out of a concern for students with limited financial resources, some publishers offer a period of free courtesy access. But this may lead to students having access later in the course but then having a lapsed period until they pay for the materials after the courtesy access period ends. Not having key course materials early on probably hurts learning, but how much? In this paper, we investigate the question, "Does lack of access to instructional material impact student performance in blended learning courses?" Specifically, we analyze students who purchased and obtained access to online content at different points in the course. We determine that both types of failure to obtain access to course materials (delaying in signing up for the product, or signing up for a free trial and letting the trial period lapse without purchasing the materials) are associated with substantially worse student outcomes. Students who purchased the product within the first few days of class had the best scores (median 77). Those who waited two weeks before accessing the product did the worst (median 56, effect size Cliff's Delta=0.31 1). We conclude with a discussion of possible interventions and actions that can be taken to ameliorate the situation.}

In this paper, we utilize statistical change detection techniques to investigate students' online behaviors. Using clickstream data from two large university courses, one face-to-face and one online, we illustrate how this methodology can be used to detect when students change their previewing and reviewing behavior, and how these changes can be related to other aspects of students' activity and performance.}

Existing techniques are mostly based on students' performance and on timing features. However, research in education, psychology and educational data mining has demonstrated that students' choices and strategies substantially influence learning. In this paper, we investigate the impact of students' exploration strategies on learning and propose the use of a probabilistic model jointly representing student knowledge and strategies. Our analyses are based on data collected from an interactive computer-based game. Our results show that exploration strategies are a significant predictor of the learning outcome. Furthermore, the joint models of performance and knowledge significantly improve the prediction accuracy within the game as well as on external post-test data, indicating that this combined representation provides a better proxy for learning.}

It has implications for both efforts to automate personalized instruction and to probabilistically model educational context. By modelling students as Bayesian learners, individuals who weigh their prior belief against current circumstantial data to reach conclusions, it becomes possible to both generate estimates of performance and the impact of the educational environment in probabilistic terms. This framework is tested through a Bayesian algorithm that can be used to characterize student prior knowledge in course material and predict student performance. This is demonstrated using both simulated data. The algorithm generates estimates that behave qualitatively as expected on simulated data and predict student performance substantially better than chance. A discussion of the results and the conceptual benefits of the framework follow.}

 Abstract = {As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success.

In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning.

The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them.

In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders - those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys - the tutors or adjunct faculty.}

Currently, there are vigorous debates about the quality of research evidence in medicine and psychology, with particular issues around statistical good practice, the 'file drawer effect', and ways in which incentives for stakeholders in the research process reward the quantity of research produced rather than the quality. In this paper, we present the Learning Analytics Community Exchange (LACE) project's Evidence Hub, an effort to relate research evidence in learning analytics to four propositions about learning analytics: whether they support learning, support teaching, are deployed widely, and are used ethically. Surprisingly little evidence in this strong, specific sense was found, and very little was negative (7%, N=123), suggesting that learning analytics is not immune from the pressures in other areas. We explore the evidence in one particular area in detail (whether learning analytics improve teaching and learners support in the university sector), and set out some of the weaknesses of the evidence available. We conclude that there is considerable scope for improving the evidence base for learning analytics, and set out some suggestions of ways for various stakeholders to achieve this.}

We represent student motion patterns from fine-grained logs of hands and gaze data, and then map these observed motion patterns against levels of student performance to make inferences about how embodiment plays a role in the learning process. Results show five distinct motion sequences in students' embodied interactions, and these motion patterns are statistically associated with initial and post-tutorial levels of students' understanding of feedback loops. Analysis of student gaze also shows distinctive patterns as to how low- and high-performing students attended to information presented in the simulation. Using MMLA, we show how students' explanations of feedback loops look differently according to cluster membership, which provides evidence that embodiment interacts with conceptual understanding.}

To address this challenge, we propose the use of EEG-based cognitive load detectors during learning. Despite its potential, EEG has not yet been utilized as a way to optimize instructional strategies. We take an initial step towards this goal by assessing how experimentally manipulated (easy and difficult) sections of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) influenced EEG-based estimates of students' cognitive load. We found a main effect of task difficulty on EEG-based cognitive load estimates, which were also correlated with learning performance. Our results show that EEG can be a viable source of data to model learners' mental states across a 90-minute session.}

 Abstract = {Healthcare simulations are hands-on learning experiences aimed at allowing students to practice essential skills that they may need when working with real patients in clinical workplaces. Some clinical classrooms are equipped with patient manikins that can respond to actions or that can be programmed to deteriorate over time. Students can perform assessments and interventions, and enhance their critical thinking and communication skills. There is an opportunity to exploit the students' digital traces that these manikins can pervasively capture to make key aspects of the learning process visible. The setting can be augmented with sensors to capture traces of group interaction. These multimodal data can be used to generate visualisations or feedback for students or teachers. This paper reports on an authentic classroom study using analytics to integrate multimodal data of students' interactions with the manikins and their peers in simulation scenarios. We report on the challenges encountered in deploying such analytics 'in the wild', using an analysis framework that considers the social, epistemic and physical dimensions of collocated group activity.}

Multilevel analyses of 208,057 fourth grade students in 40 countries showed that clustering students in schools by past achievement was linked to higher reading achievement, consistent with the benefits of customized, targeted instruction. Meanwhile, students had higher reading achievement with greater differences (variances) among classmates' past achievement, reading attitudes, or family SES; these results are consistent with the view that greater student differences yield more help opportunities (higher achievers help lower achievers, so that both learn), and foster learning from their different resources, attitudes and behaviors. Also, a student had higher reading achievement when classmates had more resources (SES, home educational resources, reading attitude, past achievement), suggesting that classmates shared their resources and helped one another. Modeling of non-linear relations and achievement subsamples of students supported the above interpretations. Principals can use these results and a simpler version of this methodology to re-allocate students and resources into different course sections at little cost to improve students' reading achievement.}

 Abstract = {Crowdsourcing has become an increasingly popular means to acquire human input on demand. Microtask crowdsourcing market-places facilitate the access to millions of people (called workers) who are willing to participate in tasks in return for monetary rewards or other forms of compensation. This paradigm presents a unique learning context where workers have to learn to complete tasks on-the-fly by applying their learning immediately through the course of tasks. However, most workers typically dropout early in large batches of tasks, depriving themselves of the opportunity to learn on-the-fly through the course of batch completion. By doing so workers squander a potential chance at improving their performance and completing tasks effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel method to engage and retain workers, to improve their learning in crowdsourced information finding tasks by using achievement priming. Through rigorous experimental findings, we show that it is possible to retain workers in long batches of tasks by triggering their inherent motivation to achieve and excel. As a consequence of increased worker retention, we find that workers learn to perform more effectively, depicting relatively more stable accuracy and lower task completion times in comparison to workers who drop out early.}

 Abstract = {People in general and students in particular have a tendency to misinterpret their own abilities. Some tend to underestimate their skills, while others tend to overestimate them. This paper investigates the degree to which metacognition is asymmetric in real-world learning and examines the change of a students' confidence over the course of a semester and its impact on the students' academic performance.

Our findings, conducted using 129,644 students learning in eight courses within the LearnSmart platform, indicate that poor or unrealistic metacognition is asymmetric. These students are biased in one direction: they are more likely to be overconfident than underconfident. Additionally, while the examination of the temporal aspects of confidence reveals no significant change throughout the semester, changes are more apparent in the first and the last few weeks of the course. More specifically, there is a sharp increase in underconfidence and a simultaneous decrease in realistic evaluation toward the end of the semester. Finally, both overconfidence and underconfidence seem to be correlated with students' overall course performance. An increase in overconfidence is related to higher overall performance, while an increase in underconfidence is associated with lower overall performance.}

 Abstract = {This paper presents a study of temporal analytics and discourse analysis of an online discussion, through investigation of a group of 13 in-service teachers and 2 instructors. A discussion forum consisting of 281 posts on an online collaborative learning environment was investigated. A text-mining tool was used to discover keywords from the discourse, and through social network analysis based on these keywords, a significant presence of relevant and promising ideas within discourse was revealed. However, uncovering the key ideas alone is insufficient to clearly explain students' level of understanding regarding the discussed topics. A more thorough analysis was thus performed by using temporal analytics with step-wise discourse analysis to trace the ideas and determine their impact on communal discourse. The results indicated that most ideas within the discourse could be traced to the origin of a set of improvable ideas, which impacted and also increased the community's level of interest in sharing and discussing ideas through discourse.}

 Abstract = {In this integrated study of dynamics in MOOCs discussion forums, we analyze the interplay of temporal patterns, discussion content, and the social structure emerging from the communication using mixed methods. A special focus is on the yet under-explored aspect of time dynamics and influence of the course structure on forum participation. Our analyses show dependencies between the course structure (video opening time and assignment deadlines) and the over-all forum activity whereas such a clear link could only be partially observed considering the discussion content. For analyzing the social dimension we apply role modeling techniques from social network analysis. While the types of user roles based on connection patterns are relatively stable over time, the high fluctuation of active contributors lead to frequent changes from active to passive roles during the course. However, while most users do not create many social connections they can play an important role in the content dimension triggering discussions on the course subject. Finally, we show that forum activity level can be predicted one week in advance based on the course structure, forum activity history and attributes of the communication network which enables identification of periods when increased tutor supports in the forum is necessary.}

 Abstract = {Science epistemology, or beliefs about what it means to do science and how science knowledge is generated, is an integral part of authentic science inquiry. Although the development of a sophisticated science epistemology is critical for attaining science literacy, epistemology remains an elusive construct to precisely and quantitatively evaluate. Previous work has suggested that analysis of student practices in science inquiry, such as their use of language, may be reflective of their underlying epistemologies. Here we describe the usage of a learning analytics tool, TAALES, and keyness analysis to analyze the concluding statements made by students at the end of a computer-based authentic science inquiry experience. Preliminary results indicate that linguistic analysis reveals differences in domain-general lexical sophistication and in domain-specific verb usage that are consistent with the expertise level of the participant. For example, experts tend to use more hedging language such as "may" and "support" during conclusions whereas novices use stronger language such as "cause." Using these differences, a simple, rule-based prediction algorithm with LOOCV achieved prediction accuracies of greater than 80%. These data underscore the potential for the use of learning analytics in simulated authentic inquiry to provide a novel and valuable method of assessing inquiry practices and related epistemologies.}

 Abstract = {Despite their importance for educational practice, reflective writings are still manually analysed and assessed, posing a constraint on the use of this educational technique. Recently, research started to investigate automated approaches for analysing reflective writing. Foundational to many automated approaches is the knowledge of words that are important for the genre. This research presents keywords that are specific to several categories of a reflective writing model. These keywords have been derived from eight datasets, which contain several thousand instances using the log-likelihood method. Both performance measures, the accuracy and the Cohen's , for these keywords were estimated with ten-fold cross validation. The results reached an accuracy of 0.78 on average for all eight categories and a fair to good interrater reliability for most categories even though it did not make use of any sophisticated rule-based mechanisms or machine learning approaches. This research contributes to the development of automated reflective writing analytics that are based on data-driven empirical foundations.Substantial progress has been made in understanding how teachers design for learning. However, there remains a paucity of evidence of the actual students' response towards leaning designs. Learning analytics has the power to provide just-in-time support, especially when predictive analytics is married with the way teachers have designed their course, or so-called a learning design. This study investigates how learning designs are configured over time and their impact on student activities by analyzing longitudinal data of 38 modules with a total of 43,099 registered students over 30 weeks at the Open University UK, using social network analysis and panel data analysis. Our analysis unpacked dynamic configurations of learning designs between modules over time, which allows teachers to reflect on their practice in order to anticipate problems and make informed interventions. Furthermore, by controlling for the heterogeneity between modules, our results indicated that learning designs were able to explain up to 60% of the variability in student online activities, which reinforced the importance of pedagogical context in learning analytics.}

Current research findings suggest a positive relationship between choice and varied outcome measures, but little has been reported to indicate whether these findings hold in the context of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). In this paper, we report the results of a randomized controlled experiment in which we investigate the effect of student choice on assignment completion and future achievement in an ITS. The experimental design uses three conditions to observe the effect of choice. In the first condition, students are able to choose the order in which to complete assignments, while in the second condition, students are prescribed an intuitive order in which to complete assignments. Those in the third condition were prescribed a counter-intuitive order in which to complete assignments. Results indicate that allowing students to choose the order in which to work on assignments leads to higher completion rates and better achievement at posttest. A post-hoc analysis also revealed that even considering students with similar completion rates, those given choice had higher posttest scores than those observed in any other condition. These results seem to support the many theories of the positive effect of choice on student achievement.}

Creating an IA-OER with these characteristics is not a straightforward task, especially when teachers do not have enough information/feedback to make decisions on how to improve the learning contents. In this paper we introduce ATCE - an Analytics Tool to Trace the Creation and Evaluation of IA-OERs. This tool focuses in particular on the accessibility and quality of the IA-OERs. ATCE was developed as a module within the ATutor Learning Management System (LMS). An analytics dashboard with visualizations related to the teachers' competences in the creation and evaluation of IA-OERs was included as part of the tool. This paper also presents a use case of the visualizations obtained from the creation and evaluation of one IA-OER after using our analytics tool.}

A software infrastructure for collecting multimodal learning experiences was implemented. As part of this infrastructure a Data Processing Application was developed to pre-process, analyse and generate predictions to provide feedback to the users about their learning performance. Data from different sources were stored using the xAPI standard into a cloud-based Learning Record Store. The participants of the experiment were asked to rate their learning experience through an Activity Rating Tool indicating their perceived level of productivity, stress, challenge and abilities. These self-reported performance indicators were used as markers to train a Linear Mixed Effect Model to generate learner-specific predictions of the learning performance.

The development of wearable computing through fitness trackers, watches, heart rate monitors, and clinical grade devices such as Empatica's E4 wristband now provides researchers with access to biometric data as students interact with learning content or software systems. This level of data collection promises to provide valuable insight into cognitive and affective experiences of individuals, especially when combined with traditional learning analytics data sources. Our study details the use of wearable technologies to assess the relationship between heart rate variability and the self-regulatory abilities of an individual. This is relevant for the field of learning analytics as methods become more complex and the assessment of learner performance becomes more nuanced and attentive to the affective factors that contribute to learner success}

 Abstract = {The facilitation of interpersonal relationships within a respectful learning climate is an important aspect of teaching practice. However, in large-scale online contexts, such as MOOCs, the number of learners and highly asynchronous nature militates against the development of a sense of belonging and dyadic trust. Given these challenges, instead of conventional instruments that reflect learners' affective perceptions, we suggest a set of indicators that can be used to evaluate social activity in relation to the participation structure. These group-level indicators can then help teachers to gain insights into the evolution of social activity shaped by their facilitation choices. For this study, group-level indicators were derived from measuring information exchange activity between the returning MOOC posters. By conceptualizing this group as an identity-based community, we can apply exponential random graph modelling to explain the network's structure through the configurations of direct reciprocity, triadic-level exchange, and the effect of participants demonstrating super-posting behavior. The findings provide novel insights into network amplification, and highlight the differences between the courses with different facilitation strategies. Direct reciprocation was characteristic of non-facilitated groups. Exchange at the level of triads was more prominent in highly facilitated online communities with instructor's involvement. Super-posting activity was less pronounced in networks with higher triadic exchange, and more pronounced in networks with higher direct reciprocity.We investigate automatic detection of teacher questions from audio recordings collected in live classrooms with the goal of providing automated feedback to teachers. Using a dataset of audio recordings from 11 teachers across 37 class sessions, we automatically segment the audio into individual teacher utterances and code each as containing a question or not. We train supervised machine learning models to detect the human-coded questions using high-level linguistic features extracted from automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, acoustic and prosodic features from the audio recordings, as well as context features, such as timing and turn-taking dynamics. Models are trained and validated independently of the teacher to ensure generalization to new teachers. We are able to distinguish questions and non-questions with a weighted F1 score of 0.69. A comparison of the three feature sets indicates that a model using linguistic features outperforms those using acoustic-prosodic and context features for question detection, but the combination of features yields a 5% improvement in overall accuracy compared to linguistic features alone. We discuss applications for pedagogical research, teacher formative assessment, and teacher professional development.}

 Abstract = {We investigate automatic detection of teacher questions from audio recordings collected in live classrooms with the goal of providing automated feedback to teachers. Using a dataset of audio recordings from 11 teachers across 37 class sessions, we automatically segment the audio into individual teacher utterances and code each as containing a question or not. We train supervised machine learning models to detect the human-coded questions using high-level linguistic features extracted from automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, acoustic and prosodic features from the audio recordings, as well as context features, such as timing and turn-taking dynamics. Models are trained and validated independently of the teacher to ensure generalization to new teachers. We are able to distinguish questions and non-questions with a weighted F1 score of 0.69. A comparison of the three feature sets indicates that a model using linguistic features outperforms those using acoustic-prosodic and context features for question detection, but the combination of features yields a 5% improvement in overall accuracy compared to linguistic features alone. We discuss applications for pedagogical research, teacher formative assessment, and teacher professional development.}

 Abstract = {There is an increasing interest in the analysis of both student's writing and the temporal aspects of learning data. The analysis of higher-level learning features in writing contexts requires analyses of data that could be characterised in terms of the sequences and processes of textual features present. This paper (1) discusses the extant literature on sequential and process analyses of writing; and, based on this and our own first-hand experience on sequential analysis, (2) proposes a number of approaches to both pre-process and analyse sequences in whole-texts. We illustrate how the approaches could be applied to examples drawn from our own datasets of 'rhetorical moves' in written texts, and the potential each approach holds for providing insight into that data. Work is in progress to apply this model to provide empirical insights. Although, similar sequence or process mining techniques have not yet been applied to student writing, techniques applied to event data could readily be operationalised to undercover patterns in texts.}

The results show that more considerations need to be given to establishing communication channels among stakeholders and adopting pedagogy-based approaches to learning analytics. It also reveals the shortage of guidance for developing data literacy among end-users and evaluating the progress and impact of learning analytics. Moreover, the review highlights the need to establish formalised guidelines to monitor the soundness, effectiveness, and legitimacy of learning analytics. As interest in learning analytics among higher education institutions continues to grow, this review will provide insights into policy and strategic planning for the adoption of learning analytics}

 Abstract = {Learning analytics open up a complex landscape of privacy and policy issues, which, in turn, influence how learning analytics systems and practices are designed. Research and development is governed by regulations for data storage and management, and by research ethics. Consequently, when moving solutions out the research labs implementers meet constraints defined in national laws and justified in privacy frameworks. This paper explores how the OECD, APEC and EU privacy frameworks seek to regulate data privacy, with significant implications for the discourse of learning, and ultimately, an impact on the design of tools, architectures and practices that now are on the drawing board. A detailed list of requirements for learning analytics systems is developed, based on the new legal requirements defined in the European General Data Protection Regulation, which from 2018 will be enforced as European law. The paper also gives an initial account of how the privacy discourse in Europe, Japan, South-Korea and China is developing and reflects upon the possible impact of the different privacy frameworks on the design of LA privacy solutions in these countries. This research contributes to knowledge of how concerns about privacy and data protection related to educational data can drive a discourse on new approaches to privacy engineering based on the principles of Privacy by Design. For the LAK community, this study represents the first attempt to conceptualise the issues of privacy and learning analytics in a cross-cultural context. The paper concludes with a plan to follow up this research on privacy policies and learning analytics systems development with a new international study.}

Drawing on principles from information policy both informs learning analytics and brings learning analytics into the information policy domain.

 Abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are commonly designed to enhance student learning. However, they are not typically designed to meet the needs of teachers who use them in their classrooms. ITSs generate a wealth of analytics about student learning and behavior, opening a rich design space for real-time teacher support tools such as dashboards. Whereas real-time dashboards for teachers have become popular with many learning technologies, we are not aware of projects that have designed dashboards for ITSs based on a broad investigation of teachers' needs. We conducted design interviews with ten middle school math teachers to explore their needs for on-the-spot support during blended class sessions, as a first step in a user-centered design process of a real-time dashboard. Based on multi-methods analyses of this interview data, we identify several opportunities for ITSs to better support teachers' needs, noting that the analytics commonly generated by existing teacher support tools do not strongly align with the analytics teachers expect to be most useful. We highlight key tensions and tradeoffs in the design of such real-time supports for teachers, as revealed by "Speed Dating" possible futures with teachers. This paper has implications for our ongoing co-design of a real-time dashboard for ITSs, as well as broader implications for the design of ITSs that can effectively collaborate with teachers in classroom settings.}

The aim of the study was to illuminate teachers' uses and practices of predictive data, in particular identify how predictive data was used to support students at risk of not completing or failing a module. Data were collected from statistical analysis of 17,033 students' performance by the end of the intervention, teacher usage statistics, and five individual semi-structured interviews with teachers. Findings revealed that teachers endorse the use of predictive data to support their practice yet in diverse ways and raised the need for devising appropriate intervention strategies to support students at risk.Many introductory programming environments generate a large amount of log data, but making insights from these data accessible to instructors remains a challenge. This research demonstrates that student outcomes can be accurately predicted from student program states at various time points throughout the course, and integrates the resulting predictive models into an instructor dashboard. The effectiveness of the dashboard is evaluated by measuring how well the dashboard analytics correctly suggest that the instructor help students classified as most in need. Finally, we describe a method of matching low-performing students with high-performing peer tutors, and show that the inclusion of peer tutors not only increases the amount of help given, but the consistency of help availability as well.}

 Abstract = {Many universities choose the C programming language (C) as the first one they teach their students, early on in their program. However, students often consider programming courses difficult, and these courses often have among the highest dropout rates of computer science courses offered. It is therefore critical to provide more effective instruction to help students understand the syntax of C and prevent them losing interest in programming. In addition, homework and paper-based exams are still the main assessment methods in the majority of classrooms. It is difficult for teachers to grasp students' learning situation due to the large amount of evaluation work. To facilitate teaching and learning of C, in this article we propose a system---LAPLE (Learning Analytics in Programming Language Education)---that provides a learning dashboard to capture the behavior of students in the classroom and identify the different difficulties faced by different students looking at different knowledge. With LAPLE, teachers may better grasp students' learning situation in real time and better improve educational materials using analysis results. For their part, novice undergraduate programmers may use LAPLE to locate syntax errors in C and get recommendations from educational materials on how to fix them.}

 Abstract = {The collaborative learning processes of students in online learning environments can be supported by providing learning analytics-based visualisations that foster awareness and reflection about an individual's as well as the team's behaviour and their learning and collaboration processes. For this empirical study we implemented an activity widget into the online learning environment of a live five-months Master course and investigated the predictive power of the widget indicators towards the students' grades and compared the results to those from an exploratory study with data collected in previous runs of the same course where the widget had not been in use. Together with information gathered from a quantitative as well as a qualitative evaluation of the activity widget during the course, the findings of this current study show that there are indeed predictive relations between the widget indicators and the grades, especially those regarding responsiveness, and indicate that some of the observed differences in the last run could be attributed to the implemented activity widget.The pathways and learning outcomes of university students are the culmination of numerous experiences inside and outside of the classroom, with faculty and with other students, in both formal and casual settings. These interactions are guided by the general education requirements of the university and by the learning goals of the student. The only official record and representation of each student's education is captured by their academic transcript: typically a list of courses described by name and number, grades recorded on an A-F scale and summarized by GPA, degrees awarded, and honors received. This limited approach reflects the technological affordances of a 20th century industrial age. In recent years, scholars have begun to imagine a transcript of the future, perhaps combining a richer record of the student experience along with a portfolio of authentic products of student work. In this paper, we concentrate on first, and develop analytic methods for improving measures of both classroom performance and intellectual breadth. In each case, this is done by placing elements of individual transcripts in context using information about their peers. We frame the study by addressing basic questions. Were the courses taken by the student difficult on average? Did the individual stand out from their peers? Were the courses representative of a broad intellectual experience, or did the student delve into detail in the chosen field of study? And with whom did they take courses?}

We designed a classroom study and collected data from a lower-division blended-instruction computer science class. We tracked and modeled students' reviewing and reflecting behaviors from WPGA. The results show that students demonstrated an effort and desire to review assessments regardless of if they were graded for academic performance or for attendance. Hardworking students achieved higher exam scores on average and were found to review their exams and the correct questions frequently. Additionally, student cohorts exhibited similar initial reviewing patterns, but different in-depth reviewing and reflecting strategies. Ultimately, this work contributes to the aggregation of multidimensional learning analytics across the physical and cybersphere.}

 Abstract = {Modeling has a strong focus in current science learning frameworks as a critical skill for students to learn. However, understanding students' scientific models and their modeling practices at scale is a difficult task that has not been taken up by the research literature. The complex variables involved in classroom learning, such as teacher differences, increase the difficulty of understanding this problem. This work begins with an exploration of the methods used to explore students' scientific modeling in the learning sciences space and the frameworks developed to characterize student modeling practices. Learning analytics can be used to leverage these frameworks of scientific modeling practices to explore questions around students' scientific models and their modeling practices. These analyses are focused around the use of EcoSurvey, a collaborative, digital tool used in high-school biology classrooms to model the local ecosystem. This tool was deployed in ten biology classrooms and used with varying degrees of success. There are significant teacher-level differences found in the activity sequences of students using the EcoSurvey tool. The theoretical metrics around scientific modeling practices and automatically extracted feature sequences were also used in a classification task to automatically determine a particular student's teacher. These results underline the power of learning analytics methods to give insight into how modeling practices are realized in the classroom. This work also informs changes to modeling tools, associated curricula, and supporting professional development around scientific modeling.}

Studies examining these links in first language speakers of English have traditionally relied on correlational analyses between linguistic knowledge tests and standardized math tests. For second language (L2) speakers, the majority of studies have compared math performance between proficient and non-proficient speakers of English. In this study, we take a novel approach and examine the linguistic features of student language while they are engaged in collaborative problem solving within an on-line math tutoring system. We transcribe the students' speech and use natural language processing tools to extract linguistic information related to text cohesion, lexical sophistication, and sentiment. Our criterion variables are individuals' pretest and posttest math performance scores. In addition to examining relations between linguistic features of student language production and math scores, we also control for a number of non-linguistic factors including gender, age, grade, school, and content focus (procedural versus conceptual). Linear mixed effect modeling indicates that non-linguistic factors are not predictive of math scores. However, linguistic features related to cohesion affect and lexical proficiency explained approximately 30% of the variance (R2 = .303) in the math scores.}

 Abstract = {This paper describes seamless learning analytics methods of VASCORLL (Visualization and Analysis System for COnnecting Relationships of Learning Logs). VASCORLL is a system for visualizing and analyzing the learning logs collected by the seamless learning system, which supports language learning in the real-world. As far, several studies have been made in the seamless learning environments in order to bridge formal learning over informal learning. However, their focus was the implementation of the seamless learning environment in education. This study focuses on visualizing and analyzing learning logs collected in the seamless learning environment. This paper describes how our analytics could contribute to bridging the gap between formal and informal learning. An experiment was conducted to evaluate 1) whether our developed VASCORLL is effective in connecting the words learned in formal learning to the ones learned in informal learning, 2) which social network algorithm is effective to enhance learning in the seamless learning environment. Twenty international students participated in the evaluation experiment, and they were able to increase their learning opportunities by using VASCORLL. In addition, it was found that the betweenness centrality is useful in finding central words bridging formal and informal learning.1}

 Abstract = {	Classroom experiments that evaluate the effectiveness of educational technologies do not typically examine the effects of classroom contextual variables (e.g., out-of-software help-giving and external distractions). Yet these variables may influence students' instructional outcomes. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial Classroom Log Explorer (SPACLE): a prototype tool that facilitates the rapid discovery of relationships between within-software and out-of-software events. Unlike previous tools for retrospective analysis, SPACLE replays moment-by-moment analytics about student and teacher behaviors in their original spatial context. We present a data analysis workflow using SPACLE and demonstrate how this workflow can support causal discovery. We share the results of our initial replay analyses using SPACLE, which highlight the importance of considering spatial factors in the classroom when analyzing ITS log data. We also present the results of an investigation into the effects of student-teacher interactions on student learning in K-12 blended classrooms, using our workflow, which combines replay analysis with SPACLE and causal modeling. Our findings suggest that students' awareness of being monitored by their teachers may promote learning, and that "gaming the system" behaviors may extend outside of educational software use.}

The learning analytic community, however, has rarely addressed the concept of service quality. A potential outcome of this is the provision of a learning analytics service that only meets the expectations of certain stakeholders (e.g., managers), whilst overlooking those who are most important (e.g., students). In order to resolve this issue, we outline a framework and our current progress towards developing a scale to assess student expectations and perceptions of learning analytics as a service.}

 Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the degree to which the cognitive processes in which students engage during reading comprehension could be examined through dynamical analyses of their natural language responses to texts. High school students (n = 142) generated typed self-explanations while reading a science text. They then completed a comprehension test that measured their comprehension at both surface and deep levels. The recurrent patterns of the words in students' self-explanations were first visualized in recurrence plots. These visualizations allowed us to qualitatively analyze the different self-explanation processes of skilled and less skilled readers. These recurrence plots then allowed us to calculate recurrence indices, which represented the properties of these temporal word patterns. Results of correlation and regression analyses revealed that these recurrence indices were significantly related to the students' comprehension scores at both surface- and deep levels. Additionally, when combined with summative metrics of word use, these indices were able to account for 32% of the variance in students' overall text comprehension scores. Overall, our results suggest that recurrence quantification analysis can be utilized to guide both qualitative and quantitative assessments of students' comprehension.}

Content-related, non-content, and unpartitioned interaction networks were constructed based on five different tie definitions: Direct Reply, Star, Direct Reply+Star, Limited Copresence, and Total Copresence. Results showed content-related and non-content networks to have distinct characteristics at the network, community, and individual node levels, validating the usefulness of the content/non-content distinction as an analytic tool. Network properties were less sensitive to differences in tie definition with the exception of Total Copresence, which showed distinct characteristics presenting dangers for general use, but usefulness for detecting inflated social status due to "superthread" initiation}

 Abstract = {Student knowledge modeling is an important part of modern personalized learning systems, but typically relies upon valid models of the structure of the content and skill in a domain. These models are often developed through expert tagging of skills to items. However, content creators in crowdsourced personalized learning systems often lack the time (and sometimes the domain knowledge) to tag skills themselves. Fully automated approaches that rely on the covariance of correctness on items can lead to effective skill-item mappings, but the resultant mappings are often difficult to interpret. In this paper we propose an alternate approach to automatically labeling skills in a crowdsourced personalized learning system using correlated topic modeling, a natural language processing approach, to analyze the linguistic content of mathematics problems. We find a range of potentially meaningful and useful topics within the context of the ASSISTments system for mathematics problem-solving.}

By combining this technology with biological sensors, a student in a virtual educational environment can be monitored for physiological markers of engagement or more cognitive states of learning. With this information, the virtual reality environment can be adaptively altered to reflect the student's state, essentially creating a closed-loop feedback system. This paper explores these concepts, and presents preliminary data on a combined EEG-VR working memory experiment as a first step toward a broader implementation of an intelligent adaptive learning system. This first-pass neural time-series and oscillatory data suggest that while an EEG-based neurofeedback system is feasible, more work on removing artifacts and identifying relevant and important features will lead to higher prediction accuracy.}

We use records from the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and analyse the activity of previous students. We assume that the activity of past students represents patterns, which can be used as a basis for recommendations to current students.

The measures we define are Relevance, for description of a supposed VLE activity derived from previous students of the course, and Effort, that represents the actual effort of individual current students. Based on these measures, we propose a composite measure, which we call Importance.

We use data from the previous course presentations to evaluate of the consistency of students' behaviour. We use correlation of the defined measures Relevance and Average Effort to evaluate the behaviour of two different student cohorts and the Root Mean Square Error to measure the deviation of Average Effort and individual student Effort.}

 Abstract = {In online social learning environments, tagging has demonstrated its potential to facilitate search, to improve recommendations and to foster reflection and learning.Studies have shown that shared understanding needs to be established in the group as a prerequisite for learning. We hypothesise that this can be fostered through tag recommendation strategies that contribute to semantic stabilization. In this study, we investigate the application of two tag recommenders that are inspired by models of human memory: (i) the base-level learning equation BLL and (ii) Minerva. BLL models the frequency and recency of tag use while Minerva is based on frequency of tag use and semantic context. We test the impact of both tag recommenders on semantic stabilization in an online study with 56 students completing a group-based inquiry learning project in school. We find that displaying tags from other group members contributes significantly to semantic stabilization in the group, as compared to a strategy where tags from the students' individual vocabularies are used. Testing for the accuracy of the different recommenders revealed that algorithms using frequency counts such as BLL performed better when individual tags were recommended. When group tags were recommended, the Minerva algorithm performed better. We conclude that tag recommenders, exposing learners to each other's tag choices by simulating search processes on learners' semantic memory structures, show potential to support semantic stabilization and thus, inquiry-based learning in groups.}

We then explore the possibility for automatically classifying help seeking behaviour using machine learning models. A preliminary model provides good initial results, suggesting that it may indeed be possible to construct student support systems that build off of an accurate classifier.}

In scaled online learning environments, like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), there are differences in the ability of learners to access teachers and peers to get help with their study than in more traditional educational environments. This exploratory study examines the help-seeking behaviour of learners across several MOOCs with different audiences and designs. Learning analytics techniques (e.g., dimension reduction with t-sne and clustering with affinity propagation) were applied to identify clusters and determine profiles of learners on the basis of their help-seeking behaviours. Five help-seeking learner profiles were identified which provide an insight into how learners' help-seeking behaviour relates to performance. The development of a more in-depth understanding of how learners seek help in large online learning environments is important to inform the way support for learners can be incorporated into the design and facilitation of online courses delivered at scale.}

However, few dashboards offer emotional information on the learning activity. The current study focuses on synchronous interactions via a videoconferencing tool dedicated to foreign language training. We collected data on learners' emotions in real conditions during ten sessions (five sessions for two learners). We propose to adopt and combine different models of emotions (discrete and dimensional) and to use heterogeneous APIs for measuring learners' emotions from different data sources (audio, video, self-reporting and interaction traces). Based on a thorough data analysis, we propose an approach to combine different cues to infer information on learners' emotional states. We finally present the EMODA dashboard, an affective multimodal and contextual visual analytics dashboard, which allows the tutor to monitor learners' emotions and better understand their evolution during the synchronous learning activity.}

This paper used a person-centered approach to explore students' (N = 65) facial behavior, emotions, learner traits and learning. An automatic facial expression recognition system was used to detect both middle school and university students' real-time facial movements while they learned scientific tasks in a 3D narrative video game.

The results indicated a strong statistical relationship between three specific facial movements (i.e., outer brow raising, lip tightening and lip pressing), student self-regulatory learning strategy and learning performance. Outer brow raising (AU2) had strong predictive power when a student is confronted with obstacles and does not know how to proceed. Both lip tightening and pressing (AU23 and AU24) were predictive when a student engaged in a task that requires a deep level of incoming information processing and short memory activation. The findings also suggested a correlational relationship between student self-regulatory learning strategy use and neutral state. It is hoped that this study will provide empirical evidence for helping us develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between facial behavior and complex learning especially in educational games.}

Despite their importance, relatively few attempts have been made to understand learners' emotional monitoring and regulation by using data visualizations of their own (and others') cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) self-regulated learning (SRL) processes to potentially foster their emotion regulation (ER). We present a theoretically based and empirically driven conceptual framework that addresses ER by proposing the use of visualizations of one's own and others' CAMM SRL multichannel data to facilitate learners' monitoring and regulation of emotions during learning with ALTs. We use an example with eye-tracking data to illustrate the mapping between theoretical assumptions, ER strategies, and the types of data visualizations that can enhance learners' ER, including key processes such as emotion flexibility, emotion adaptivity, and emotion efficacy. We conclude with future directions leading to a systematic interdisciplinary research agenda that addresses outstanding ER-related issues by integrating models, theories, methods, and analytical techniques for the cognitive, learning, and affective sciences; human- computer interaction (HCI); data visualization; big data; data mining; and SRL.}

This initiative is focused on exploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 degrees profile will be built including information characterizing the user's online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies.}

By contrast, online learning environments afford fewer social cues to facilitate social comparison. Can increased availability of such cues promote effective self-regulatory behavior and achievement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)? We developed a personalized feedback system that facilitates social comparison with previously successful learners based on an interactive visualization of multiple behavioral indicators. Across four randomized controlled trials in MOOCs (overall N = 33, 726), we find: (1) the availability of social comparison cues significantly increases completion rates, (2) this type of feedback benefits highly educated learners, and (3) learners' cultural context plays a significant role in their course engagement and achievement.}

 Abstract = {Among all of the learners in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) who intend to complete a course, the majority fail to do so. This intention-action gap is found in many domains of human experience, and research in similar goal pursuit domains suggests that plan-making is a cheap and effective nudge to encourage follow-through. In a natural field experiment in three HarvardX courses, some students received open-ended planning prompts at the beginning of a course. These prompts increased course completion by 29%, and payment for certificates by 40%. This effect was largest for students enrolled in traditional schools. Furthermore, the contents of students' plans could predict which students were least likely to succeed - in particular, students whose plans focused on specific times were unlikely to complete the course. Our results suggest that planning prompts can help learners adopted productive frames of mind at the outset of a learning goal that encourage and forecast student success.}

 Abstract = {Learning analytics research has often been touted as a means to address concerns regarding student retention outcomes. However, few research studies to date, have examined the impact of the implemented intervention strategies designed to address such retention challenges. Moreover, the methodological rigor of some of the existing studies has been challenged. This study evaluates the impact of a pilot retention program. The study contrasts the findings obtained by the use of different methods for analysis of the effect of the intervention. The pilot study was undertaken between 2012 and 2014 resulting in a combined enrolment of 11,160 students. A model to predict attrition was developed, drawing on data from student information system, learning management system interactions, and assessment. The predictive model identified some 1868 students as academically at-risk. Early interventions were implemented involving learning and remediation support. Common statistical methods demonstrated a positive association between the intervention and student retention. However, the effect size was low. The use of more advanced statistical methods, specifically mixed-effect methods explained higher variability in the data (over 99%), yet found the intervention had no effect on the retention outcomes. The study demonstrates that more data about individual differences is required to not only explain retention but to also develop more effective intervention approaches.

 Abstract = {Advances in the learning analytics community have created opportunities to deliver early warnings that alert teachers and instructors when a student is at risk of not meeting academic goals [6], [71]. Alert systems have also been developed for school district leaders [33] and for academic advisors in higher education [39], but other professionals in the K-12 system, namely guidance counselors, have not been widely served by these systems. In this study, we use college enrollment models created for the ASSISTments learning system [55] to develop reports that target the needs of these professionals, who often work directly with students, but usually not in classroom settings. These reports are designed to facilitate guidance counselors' efforts to help students to set long term academic and career goals. As such, they provide the calculated likelihood that a student will attend college (the ASSISTments College Prediction Model or ACPM), alongside student engagement and learning measures. Using design principles from risk communication research and student feedback theories to inform a co-design process, we developed reports that can inform guidance counselor efforts to support student achievement.}

In this study, we report the result of a hazard analysis based on students' behavioral engagement with different digital instructional technologies over the course of a semester. We observe substantially different adoption and use behavior between students who did and did not experience academic difficulty in the course. Students who experienced moderate academic difficulty benefited the most from using tools that helped them plan their study behaviors. Students who experienced more severe academic difficulty benefited from tools that helped them prepare for exams. We observed that students adopted most tools and system features before they experienced academic difficulty, and students who adopted early were more likely to recover.}

 Abstract = {This workshop aims to promote strategic planning for learning analytics in higher education through developing institutional policies. While adoption of learning analytics is predominantly seen in small-scale and bottom-up patterns, it is believed that a systemic implementation can bring the widest impact to the education system and lasting benefits to learners. However, the success of it highly depends on the adopted strategy that meets the needs of various stakeholders and systematically pushes the institution towards achieving its targets. It is imperative to develop a learning analytics policy that ensures a practice that is valid, effective and ethical.

The workshop involves two components. The first component includes a set of presentations about the state of learning analytics in higher education, drawing on results from an Australian and a European project examining institutional learning analytics policy and adoption processes. The second component is an interactive session where participants are encouraged to share their motivations for adopting learning analytics and the diversity of challenges they perceive impede analytics adoption in their institution. Using the RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach (ROMA), participants will create a draft policy that articulates how the various challenges can be addressed. This workshop aims to further develop our understanding of how learning analytics operates in an organizational system and promote a cultural change in how such analytics are adopted in higher education.}

 Abstract = {Educational practitioners and policy makers require evidence supporting claims about educational efficacy. Evidence is often found using causal relationships between education inputs and student learning outcomes. Causal inference covers a wide range of topics in education research, including efficacy studies to prove if a new policy, software, curriculum or intervention is effective in improving student learning outcomes. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered a gold standard method to demonstrate causality. However, these studies are expensive, timely and costly, as well as not being ethical to conduct in many educational contexts. Causality can also be deducted purely from observational data. In this tutorial, we will review methodologies for estimating the causal effects of education inputs on student learning outcomes using observational data. This is an inherently complex task due to many hidden variables and their interrelationships in educational research. In this tutorial, we discuss causal inference in the context of educational research with big data. This is the first tutorial of its kind at Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK) that provides a hands-on experience with Python and Apache Spark as a practical tool for educational researchers to conduct causal inference. As a prerequisite, attendees are required to have familiarity with Python.}

 Abstract = {The 2nd LAK Failathon will build on the successful event in 2016 and extend the workshop beyond discussing individual experiences of failure to exploring how the field can improve, particularly regarding the creation and use of evidence.

Failure in research is an increasingly hot topic, with high-profile crises of confidence in the published research literature in medicine and psychology. Among the major factors in this research crisis are the many incentives to report and publish only positive findings. These incentives prevent the field in general from learning from negative findings, and almost entirely preclude the publication of mistakes and errors. Thus providing an alternative forum for practitioners and researchers to learn from each other's failures can be very productive. The first LAK Failathon, held in 2016, provided just such an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures and negative findings in a lower-stakes environment, to help participants learn from each other's mistakes. It was very successful, and there was strong support for running it as an annual event. This workshop will build on that success, with twin objectives to provide an environment for individuals to learn from each other's failures, and also to co-develop plans for how we as a field can better build and deploy our evidence base.}

The underlying concern is how to integrate and coordinate learning analytics seeking to understand the particular pedagogical needs and context constraints to provide learning analytics support across digital and physical spaces. The goals of the workshop are to consolidate the Cross-LAK sub-community and provide a forum for idea generation that can build up further collaborations.

We will present LearnSphere, an NSF funded system that supports collaborating on and sharing a wide variety of educational data, learning analytics methods, and visualizations while maintaining confidentiality. We will then have hands-on sessions in which attendees have the opportunity to apply existing learning analytics workflows to their choice of educational datasets in the repository (using a simple drag-and-drop interface), add their own learning analytics workflows (requires very basic coding experience), or both. Leaders and attendees will then jointly discuss the unique benefits as well as the limitations of these solutions.

To support assessment of student learning in BBPEs, we propose a learning analytics framework that combines hypothesis- and data-driven approaches to discern students' programming strategies from BBPE log data. We use a principled approach to design assessment tasks to elicit evidence of specific CT skills. Piloting these tasks in high school classrooms enabled us to analyze student programs and video recordings of students as they built their programs. We discuss a priori patterns derived from this analysis to support data-driven analysis of log data in order to better assess understanding and use of CT in BBPEs.}

The previous findings showed that (1) students who attained consistently good achievement more frequently browsed different e-books and their pages than low achievers and that (2) this difference was found only for logs of preparation for course sessions (preview), not for reviewing material (review). Preliminarily, we analyzed e-book logs from four courses. The results were reproduced in only one course and only partially, that is, (1) high achievers more frequently changed e-books than low achievers (2) for preview. This finding suggests that to allow effective usage of learning and teaching analyses, we need to carefully construct an educational environment to ensure reproducibility.}

 Abstract = {For students, in particular freshmen, the degree pathway from semester to semester is not that transparent, although students have a reasonable idea what courses are expected to be taken each semester. An often-pondered question by students is: "what can I expect in the next semester?" More precisely, given the commitment and engagement I presented in this particular course and the respective performance I achieved, can I expect a similar outcome in the next semester in the particular course I selected? Are the demands and expectations in this course much higher so that I need to adjust my commitment and engagement and overall workload if I expect a similar outcome? Is it better to drop a course to manage expectations rather than to (predictably) fail, and perhaps have to leave the degree altogether? Degree and course advisors and student support units find it challenging to provide evidence based advise to students. This paper presents research into educational process mining and student data analytics in a whole university scale approach with the aim of providing insight into the degree pathway questions raised above. The beta-version of our course level degree pathway tool has been used to shed light for university staff and students alike into our university's 1,300 degrees and associated 6 million course enrolments over the past 20 years.}

 Abstract = {This poster will be a chance for a wider LAK audience to engage with the 2nd LAK Failathon workshop. Both of these will build on the successful Failathon event in 2016 and extend beyond discussing individual experiences of failure to exploring how the field can improve, particularly regarding the creation and use of evidence.

Failure in research is an increasingly hot topic, with high-profile crises of confidence in the published research literature in medicine and psychology. Among the major factors in this research crisis are the many incentives to report and publish only positive findings. These incentives prevent the field in general from learning from negative findings, and almost entirely preclude the publication of mistakes and errors. Thus providing an alternative forum for practitioners and researchers to learn from each other's failures can be very productive. The first LAK Failathon, held in 2016, provided just such an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures and negative findings in a lower-stakes environment, to help participants learn from each other's mistakes. It was very successful, and there was strong support for running it as an annual event. The 2nd LAK Failathon workshop will build on that success, with twin objectives to provide an environment for individuals to learn from each other's failures, and also to co-develop plans for how we as a field can better build and deploy our evidence base.

This poster is an opportunity for wider feedback on the plans developed in the workshop, with interactive use of sticky notes to add new ideas and coloured dots to illustrate prioritisation. This broadens the participant base in this important work, which should improve the quality of the plans and the commitment of the community to delivering them.}

Data analysis identified more than 15% of all registrants as returning learners. Findings from click log analysis identified possible motivations of re-enrollment including improving grades, refreshing theoretical understanding, and solving practical problems. Further analysis uncovered evidence of self-regulated learning strategies among returning learners. Taken together, this study contributes to ongoing inquiry into MOOCs learning pathways, informs future MOOC design, and sheds light on the exploration of MOOCs as a viable option for teacher professional development.}

First, it informs the instructors and students of the important topics in the course; without learning them properly students will not be successful. Second, it highlights any inconsistencies in defining the learning objective, how they are being assessed, and design of the course. Thus, this approach can be used as a course design diagnostic tool.}

To improve students' meaningful learning of conceptual knowledge in WTL activities, the project proposes to develop the Write-and-Learn system to generate automated formative feedback by taking advantage of the concept maps constructed from instructors' lecture notes and individual students' writing assignments. The proposed research aims to provide insights into how to apply concept maps into WTL activities to generate effective formative feedback on the acquisition and development of conceptual knowledge, and explore how and to what extent concept map-based formative feedback can be utilized to scaffold and promote meaningful learning in WTL activities.}

In this study, we investigating the efficacy of a model of behavioural and agentic engagement to predict student performance (low, middle, high) at four timepoints in a semester. The model was significant at all four timepoints. Measures of behavioural and agentic engagement predicted membership across the three groups differently. With a few exceptions, these differences were consistent across timepoints. Looking at variations in student engagement across time can be used to target interventions to support student success at the undergraduate level.}

Thus we need to know the status of teachers' usage earlier before we decide to give them some technical supports.

The first step in doing so is to identify what Knowledge Components (KCs) exist in the content; while the content is tagged by experts, these tags need to be re-calibrated periodically.

LearnSmart courses are organized into chapters corresponding to those found in a textbook; each chapter can have anywhere from about a hundred to a few thousand questions. The KC extraction algorithms proposed by Barnes [1] and Desmarais et al [3] are applied on a chapter-by-chapter basis. To assess the ability of each mined q matrix to describe the observed learning, the PFA model of Pavlik et al [4] is fitted to it and a cross-validated AUC is calculated. The models are assessed based on whether PFA's predictions of student correctness are accurate.

Early results show that both algorithms do a reasonable job of describing student progress, but q matrices with very different numbers of KCs fit observed data similarly well. Consequently, further consideration is required before automated extraction is practical in this context.}

The aim is to develop our understanding of multimodal data that unobtrusively capture cognitive, meta-cognitive, affective and motivational states of learners over time. This demands for a concerted interdisciplinary dialogue combining findings from psychology and educational sciences with advances in computer sciences and artificial intelligence. The participants in this E-CIR are leading international researchers who have articulated different emerging perspectives and methodologies to measure cognition, metacognition, motivation, and emotions during learning. The participants recognize the need for intensive collaboration to accelerate progress with new interdisciplinary methods including learning analytics to develop more powerful adaptive educational technologies.}

 Abstract = {As is the case for many undergraduate STEM degree programs, computing degree programs are plagued by high attrition rates. This is especially true in early computing courses, in which failure and drop-out rates in the 35 to 50 percent range are common. By collecting learning process data as students engage in computer programming assignments, computing educators can place themselves in a position not only to better understand students' struggles, but also to better tailor instructional interventions to students' needs. We have developed OSBLE+, a learning management and analytics environment that interfaces with a computer programming environment to support the automatic collection of learners' programming process and social data as they work on programming assignments, while also providing an interactive environment for the analysis and visualization of those data. In ongoing work, we are using OSBLE+ to explore two possibilities: (a) leveraging learning and social data to strategically deliver automated learning interventions, and (b) presenting learners with visual representations of their learning data in order to prompt them to reflect on and discuss their learning processes.}

 Abstract = {In this paper, we pose the question, can the tracking and analysis of the physical movements of students and teachers within a Practice-Based Learning (PBL) environment reveal information about the learning process that is relevant and informative to Learning Analytics (LA) implementations? Using the example of trials conducted in the design of a LA system, we aim to show how the analysis of physical movement from a macro level can help to enrich our understanding of what is happening in the classroom. The results suggest that Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) could be used to generate valuable information about the human factors of the collaborative learning process and we propose how this information could assist in the provision of relevant supports for small group work. More research is needed to confirm the initial findings with larger sample sizes and refine the data capture and analysis methodology to allow automation.}

 Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss Colorado State University Online's progress toward designing automated survey reports for student feedback data collected through our newly designed LTI survey tool. Using multiple R packages, including 'rmarkdown' and 'likert', the reporting tool imports student survey response data and generates reports for faculty and instructional designers. These reports focus on student perceptions of communication, course design, academic challenge, general satisfaction, and more. These reports display visual representations of the Likert-type response frequencies, basic descriptive statistics, and free-response comments. Surveys are administered just before half-way through the semester to provide formative feedback and just before the end of the semester to provide summative feedback. In this way, faculty and instructional designers can obtain a quick and easily digestible report to make changes and improvements to their classes with minimal effort in the back end production.}

In this paper, we introduce MORPH, a platform that facilitates the integration of learning analytics modules and tools into institutional learning systems. MORPH provides a robust distributed architecture which combines batch, stream and real-time data processing using a parallel processing model to enable and support efficient processing of large amounts of data. Furthermore, it provides common management and administration features that enable the seamless integration of learning analytics research modules and tools into existing institutional learning systems.}

Aided by big data coming from learning content management and massive open online course systems, these researchers have an unparalleled opportunity for insight into the teaching and learning process. In this paper we summarize some of the challenges and opportunities arising out of three workshops on Educational Discourse. These workshops convened both expert and emerging scholars to discuss the (i) ethical, (ii) technical, and (iii) infrastructure barriers to building a research community focused on computer-mediated educational discourse. Of particular note is that while computational infrastructure exists for storing and manipulating educational discourse, there is a need for a sociotechnical infrastructure upon which community members can come together to engage in joint work.}

The educational technology combined teacher dashboards (extracted analytics) and class and individually paced assignments (embedded analytics). The results indicated that children in the LA-ET condition made significantly more progress on arithmetic skills in one schoolyear compared to children in the paper & pencil condition.}
