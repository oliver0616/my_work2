abstract = {Real-world learning in a field is an important educational area for experience-based activities. Formative assessment by constant monitoring of the intellectual achievement of real-world learners is essential for adaptive learning support, but no assessment methodology has yet been developed. We consider a method to systematically integrate heterogeneous factors of real-world learning: learners' internal situations, their external situations, and their learning field. Then, we propose a method for formatively assessing the situation of real-world learning. The method enables us to recognize the sequence of characteristic stay behavior and the associated body posture of a learner, and to estimate the 3D location of his/her interest. The method enables the estimation of not only the learning topic that a learner is currently examining in a field but also the prospective topics that he/she should learn. Our assessment method is the basis for context-aware support to promote the emergence of new knowledge from intellectual collaboration in the world.},

Then, we propose to use data from Moodle's logs about each cluster/group of students separately in order to be able to obtain more specific and accurate models of students' behaviour. The results show that the fitness of the specific models is greater than the general model obtained using all the data, and the comprehensibility of the models can be also improved in some cases.},

The overall goal of the Customized Course Advising project is to determine the optimal term-by-term course selections for all engineering students based on their incoming characteristics and previous course history and performance, paying particular attention to concurrent enrollment. We found that ACT Math, SAT Math, and Advanced Placement exam can be effective measures to measure the students' academic preparation level.

Classroom visual design has been previously studied, but not in terms of the systematic patterns adopted by teachers in selecting what materials to place on classroom walls, or in terms of the actual semantic content of what is placed on walls. This is potentially important, as classroom walls are continuously seen by students, and form a continual off-task behavior option, available to students at all times. Using the k-means clustering algorithm, we find four types of visual classroom environments (one of them an outlier within our data set), representing teachers' strategies in classroom decoration. Our results indicate that the degree to which teachers place content-related decorations on the walls, is a feature of particular importance for distinguishing which approach teachers are using. Similarly, the type of school (e.g. whether private or charter) appeared to be another significant factor in determining teachers' design choices for classroom walls. The present findings begin the groundwork to better understand the impact of teacher decisions and choices in classroom design that lead to better outcomes in terms of engagement and learning, and finally towards developing classroom designs that are more effective and engaging for learners.

However, the quantity of data, and the range of different data sources, can make it difficult to take systematic action on that data. Previous work in the literature has emphasised the need for and value of human meaning-making in the process of interpretation of data to transform it in to actionable intelligence.
This paper describes a programme of human Data Wranglers deployed at the Open University, UK, charged with making sense of a range of data sources related to learning, analysing that data in the light of their understanding of practice in individual faculties/departments, and producing reports that summarise the key points and make actionable recommendations.
The evaluation of and experience in this programme of work strongly supports the value of human meaning-makers in the learning analytics process, and suggests that barriers to organisational change in this area can be mitigated by embedding learning analytics work within strategic contexts, and working at an appropriate level and granularity of analysis.

We want to understand whether the learners' answers to the already asked questions can affect the way they will answer the subsequent asked questions and if so, to what extent. Through our analysis we first identify the most difficult and easiest multiplications for the target learners by observing the probabilities of the different answer types. Next we try to identify influential structures in the history of learners' answers considering the Markov chain of different orders. The results are used to identify pupils who have difficulties with multiplications very soon (after couple of steps) and to optimize the way questions are asked for each pupil individually.},

Carnegie Learning's MATHia™ software for middle school mathematics asks learners to specify domains of their interest (e.g., sports & fitness, arts & music), as well as names of friends/classmates, and uses this information to both choose and personalize word problems for individual learners. Our analysis of MATHia's relatively coarse-grained personalization contrasts with more finegrained analysis in previous research on word problems in the Cognitive Tutor (e.g., finding effects on performance in parts of problems that depend on more difficult skills), and we explore associations of aggregate preference "honoring" with learner performance. To do so, we define a notion of "strong" learner interest area preferences and find that honoring such preferences has a small negative association with performance. However, learners that both merely express preferences (either interest area preferences or setting names of friends/classmates), and those that express strong preferences, tend to perform in ways that are associated with better learning compared to learners that do not express such preferences. We consider several explanations of these findings and suggest important topics for future research.

A consistent message from universities participating in MOOC delivery is their eagerness to understand students' online learning processes. This paper reports on an exploratory investigation of students' learning processes in two MOOCs which have different curriculum and assessment designs. When viewed through the lens of common MOOC learning analytics, the high level of initial student interest and, ultimately, the high level of attrition, makes these two courses appear very similar to each other, and to MOOCs in general. With the goal of developing a greater understanding of students' patterns of learning behavior in these courses, we investigated alternative learning analytic approaches and visual representations of the output of these analyses. Using these approaches we were able to meaningfully classify student types and visualize patterns of student engagement which were previously unclear. The findings from this research contribute to the educational community's understanding of students' engagement and performance in MOOCs, and also provide the broader learning analytics community with suggestions of new ways to approach learning analytic data analysis and visualization.

We conclude that the MOOC activity drops not only due to the drop-outs. When students skips around 10% of the proposed activities, the percentage of passing the course decrease in a 25%.

The ability to pinpoint students who might soon decide to drop out of a given academic program allows those in charge to not only understand the causes for this undesired outcome, but it also provides room for the development of early intervention systems. While making such inferences based on academic performance data alone is certainly possible, we claim that in many cases there is no substantial correlation between how well a student performs and his or her decision to withdraw. This is specially true when the overall set of students has a relatively similar academic performance. To address this issue, we derive measurements of engagement from students' electronic portfolios and show how these features can be effectively used to augment the quality of predictions.

abstract = {This paper reports findings from the implementation of a learning analytics-powered Early Warning System (EWS) by academic advisors who were novice users of data-driven learning analytics tools. The information collected from these users sheds new light on how student analytic data might be incorporated into the work practices of advisors working with university students. Our results indicate that advisors predominantly used the EWS during their meetings with students---despite it being designed as a tool to provide information to prepare for meetings and identify students who are struggling academically. This introduction of an unintended audience brings significant design implications to bear that are relevant for learning analytics innovations.

However, the forecasting literature has demonstrated the predictive equivalence of much simpler methods. We directly compare one simple tabulation technique, the index method, to a linear multiple regression approach for identifying students at risk. The broader purpose is to explore the plausibility of a flexible method that is conducive to adoption and diffusion. In this respect this paper fits within the ambit of the modest computing agenda, and suggests the possibility of a modest analytics. We built both regression and index method models on 2011 student data and applied these to 2012 student data. The index method was comparable in terms of predictive accuracy of student risk. We suggest that the context specificity of learning environments makes the index method a promising tool for educators who want a situated risk algorithm that is flexible and adaptable.},

Advances in text and video analytics provide the capability of investigating students' use of the tool and the psychometrics and linguistic processes evident in their written annotations. This paper reports on a study exploring students' use of a video annotation tool when two different instructional approaches were deployed -- graded and non-graded self-reflection annotations within two courses in the performing arts. In addition to counts and temporal locations of self-reflections, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC) framework was used for the extraction of variables indicative of the linguistic and psychological processes associated with self-reflection annotations of videos. The results indicate that students in the course with graded self-reflections adopted more linguistic and psychological related processes in comparison to the course with non-graded self-reflections. In general, the effect size of the graded reflections was lower for students who took both courses in parallel. Consistent with prior research, the study identified that students tend to make the majority of their self-reflection annotations early in the video time line. The paper also provides several suggestions for future research to better understand the application of video annotations in facilitating student learning.

However, the adoption of peer assessment is slow due in part to the lack of ready-to-use systems. Furthermore, the validity of peer assessment is still under discussion. In this paper, in order to tackle some of these issues, we present as a proof-of-concept of a novel extension of Graasp, a social media platform, to setup a peer assessment activity. We then report a case study of peer assessment using Graasp in a Social Media course with 60 master's level university students and analyze the level of agreement between students and instructors in the evaluation of short individual reports. Finally, to see if both instructor and student evaluations were based on appearance of project reports rather than on content, we conducted a study with 40 kids who rated reports solely on their look. Our results convey the fact that unlike the kid evaluation, which shows a low level of agreement with instructors, student assessment is reliable since the level of agreement between instructors and students was high.},

Current computationally driven methods (e.g., latent semantic analysis or learning based image classifiers) for classifying student contributions don't include the ability to function on multimodal artifacts (e.g., sketches, videos, or annotated images) that new technologies enable. We have developed and implemented a classifcation algorithm based on learners' interactions with the artifacts they create. This new form of semi-automated concept classification, coined Collaborative Spatial Classification, leverages the spatial arrangement of artifacts to provide a visualization that generates summary level data about about idea distribution. This approach has two benefits. First, students learn to identify and articulate patterns and connections among classmates ideas. Second, the teacher receives a high-level view of the distribution of ideas, enabling them to decide how to shift their instructional practices in real-time.},

Students' textual responses to short answer questions offer a rich source of data for formative assessment. However, automatically analyzing textual constructed responses poses significant computational challenges, and the difficulty of generating accurate assessments is exacerbated by the disfluencies that occur prominently in elementary students' writing. With robust text analytics, there is the potential to accurately analyze students' text responses and predict students' future success. In this paper, we present WriteEval, a hybrid text analytics method for analyzing student-composed text written in response to constructed response questions. Based on a model integrating a text similarity technique with a semantic analysis technique, WriteEval performs well on responses written by fourth graders in response to short-text science questions. Further, it was found that WriteEval's assessments correlate with summative analyses of student performance.

To that end, the authors developed and piloted a survey, the Learning Analytics Readiness Instrument (LARI), in an attempt to help institutions successfully prepare themselves for a successfully analytics implementation. The LARI is comprised of 90 items encompassing five factors related to a learning analytics implementation: (1) Ability, (2) Data, (3) Culture and Process, (4) Governance and Infrastructure, and, (5) Overall Readiness Perception. Each of the five factors has a high internal consistency, as does the overall tool.

As indicated in previous research, regularity of learning is a strong indicator to explain learners' consistent endeavors.

Implications for the learning analytics field seeking a pedagogical theory-driven approach are discussed.

As these systems grow more complex, there is an increasing need to incorporate relevant and real-time course-related information that could be predictors of a student's success or failure. This paper presents an investigation of how to incorporate students' use of course resources from a Learning Management System (LMS) into an existing EWS. Specifically, we focus our efforts on understanding the relationship between course resource use and a student's final course grade. Using ten semesters of LMS data from a requisite Chemistry course, we categorized course resources into four categories. We used a multinomial logistic regression model with semester fixed-effects to estimate the relationship between course resource use and the likelihood that a student receives an "A" or "B" in the course versus a "C." Results suggest that students who use Exam Preparation or Lecture resources to a greater degree than their peers are more likely to receive an "A" or "B" as a final grade. We discuss the implications of our results for the further development of this EWS and EWSs in general.},

This paper first makes the case for the overall importance of intervention design, situating it within the larger landscape of the learning analytics field, and then considers the specific issues of intervention design for student use of learning analytics. Four principles of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design that can be used by teachers and course developers to support the productive use of learning analytics by students are introduced: Integration, Agency, Reference Frame and Dialogue. In addition three core processes in which to engage students are described: Grounding, Goal-Setting and Reflection. These principles and processes are united in a preliminary model of pedagogical learning analytics intervention design for students, presented as a starting point for further inquiry.},

Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) addresses all of these issues, as shown in an analysis of 1,330 asynchronous messages written and self-coded by 17 students during a 13-week online educational technology course. The results showed how attributes at multiple levels (individual and message) affected knowledge creation processes. Men were more likely than women to theorize. Asynchronous messages created a micro-sequence context; opinions and asking about purpose preceded new information; anecdotes, opinions, different opinions, elaborating ideas, and asking about purpose or information preceded theorizing.

abstract = {Temporality matters for analysis of collaborative learning. The present study attempts to uncover temporal patterns that distinguish "productive" threads of knowledge building inquiry. Using a rich knowledge building discourse dataset, in which notes' contribution types and threads' productivity have been coded, a secondary temporal analysis was conducted. In particular, Lag-sequential Analysis was conducted to identify transitional patterns among different contribution types that distinguish productive threads from "improvable" ones. Results indicated that productive inquiry threads involved significantly more transitions among questioning, theorizing, obtaining information, and working with information; in contrast, responding to questions and theories by merely giving opinions was not sufficient to achieve knowledge progress. This study highlights the importance of investigating temporality in collaborative learning and calls for attention to developing and testing temporal analysis methods in learning analytics research.

The emerging field of learning analytics is at the intersection of numerous academic disciplines, and therefore draws on a diversity of methodologies, theories and underpinning scientific assumptions. Through citation analysis and structured mapping we aimed to identify the emergence of trends and disciplinary hierarchies that are influencing the development of the field to date. The results suggest that there is some fragmentation in the major disciplines (computer science and education) regarding conference and journal representation. The analyses also indicate that the commonly cited papers are of a more conceptual nature than empirical research reflecting the need for authors to define the learning analytics space. An evaluation of the current state of learning analytics provides numerous benefits for the development of the field, such as a guide for under-represented areas of research and to identify the disciplines that may require more strategic and targeted support and funding opportunities.},

After distinguishing humane education from training on the basis of the Aristotelian model of intellectual capabilities, and arguing that humane education is distinct by virtue of its interest in cultivating prudence, which is unteachable, an account of three key characteristics of humane education is provided. Appealing to thinkers of the Italian Renaissance, it is argued that ingenium, eloquence, and self-knowledge constitute the what, how, and why of humane education. Lastly, looking to several examples from recent learning analytics literature, it is demonstrated that learning analytics is not only helpful as set of aids for ensuring success in scientific and technical disciplines, but in the humanities as well. In order to function effectively as an aid to humane education, however, learning analytics must be embedded within a context that encourages continuous reflection, responsiveness, and personal responsibility for learning.},

This introduces a new set of challenges, because education is a stable system, resistant to change. Implementing learning analytics at scale involves working with the entire technological complex that exists around technology-enhanced learning (TEL). This includes the different groups of people involved -- learners, educators, administrators and support staff -- the practices of those groups, their understandings of how teaching and learning take place, the technologies they use and the specific environments within which they operate. Each element of the TEL Complex requires explicit and careful consideration during the process of implementation, in order to avoid failure and maximise the chances of success. In order for learning analytics to be implemented successfully at scale, it is crucial to provide not only the analytics and their associated tools but also appropriate forms of support, training and community building.},

abstract = {The focus of this workshop is on the potential benefits and challenges of using specific computational methods to analyze interactions in networked learning environments, particularly with respect to integrating multiple analytic approaches towards understanding learning at multiple levels of agency, from individual to collective. The workshop is designed for researchers interested in analytical studies of collaborative and networked learning in socio-technical networks, using data-intensive computational methods of analysis (including social-network analysis, log-file analysis, information extraction and data mining). The workshop may also be of interest to pedagogical professionals and educational decision makers who want to evaluate the potential of learning analytics techniques to better inform their decisions regarding learning in technology-rich environments.},

abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) as a field remains in its infancy. Many of the techniques now prominent from practitioners have been drawn from various fields, including HCI, statistics, computer science, and learning sciences. In order for LA to grow and advance as a discipline, two significant challenges must be met: 1) development of analytics methods and techniques that are native to the LA discipline, and 2) practitioners in LA to develop algorithms and models that reflect the social and computational dimensions of analytics. This workshop introduces researchers in learning analytics to machine learning (ML) and the opportunities that ML can provide in building next generation analysis models.},
