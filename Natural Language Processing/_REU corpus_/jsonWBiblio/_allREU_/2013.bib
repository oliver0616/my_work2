abstract = {Learning Analytics, an emerging field concerned with analyzing the vast data "given off" by learners in technology supported settings to inform educational theory and practice, has from its inception taken a multidisciplinary approach that integrates studies of learning with technological capabilities. In this introduction to the Proceedings of the Third International Learning Analytics & Knowledge Conference, we discuss how Learning Analytics must function in the "middle space" where learning and analytic concerns meet. Dialogue in this middle space involves diverse stakeholders from multiple disciplines with various conceptions of the agency and nature of learning. We hold that a singularly unified field is not possible nor even desirable if we are to leverage the potential of this diversity, but progress is possible if we support "productive multivocality" between the diverse voices involved, facilitated by appropriate use of boundary objects. We summarize the submitted papers and contents of these Proceedings to characterize the voices and topics involved in the multivocal discourse of Learning Analytics.},

In this paper, we present the results of an evaluation study of our dashboard, called StepUp!, and the extent to which it addresses issues and needs of our students. Through brainstorming sessions with our students, we identified and prioritized learning issues and needs. In a second step, we deployed StepUp! during one month and we evaluated to which extent our dashboard addresses the issues and needs identified earlier in different courses. The results show that our tool has potentially higher impact for students working in groups and sharing a topic than students working individually on different topics.},

Reliable feedback from the audience could improve personal skills and work performance. To address this shortcoming we have developed the Live Interest Meter App (LIM App) that supports the gathering, aggregation and visualization of feedback. This application allows audience members to easily provide and quantify their feedback through a simple meter. We conducted several experimental tests to investigate the acceptance and perceived usefulness of the LIM App and a user study in an academic setting to inform its further development. The results of the study illustriate the potential of the LIM App to be used in such scenarios. Main findings show the need for motivating students to use the application, the readiness of presenters to learn retrospectively, and distraction as the main concern of end users.},

We propose that SLA based on these perspectives needs to devise models and visualizations capable of showing not only the usual SNA metrics, but the types of social tie forged between actors, and topic-specific subnetworks. We describe a technical implementation demonstrating this approach, which extends the Network Awareness Tool by automatically populating it with data from a social learning platform SocialLearn. The result is the ability to visualize relationships between people who interact around the same topics.},

This data can be exploited to gain insights on how learners' collaborative activities, ideas and concepts are developed during the process of writing. Ultimately, it can also be used to provide support to improve the quality of the written documents and the writing skills of learners involved. In this paper, we propose three visualisation approaches and their underlying techniques for analysing writing processes used in a document written by a group of authors: (1) the revision map, which summarises the text edits made at the paragraph level, over the time of writing. (2) the topic evolution chart, which uses probabilistic topic models, especially Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its extension, DiffLDA, to extract topics and follow their evolution during the writing process. (3) the topic-based collaboration network, which allows a deeper analysis of topics in relation to author contribution and collaboration, using our novel algorithm DiffATM in conjunction with a DiffLDA-related technique. These models are evaluated to examine whether these automatically discovered topics accurately describe the evolution of writing processes. We illustrate how these visualisations are used with real documents written by groups of graduate students.},

A pedagogical model that translates the concepts and findings of the research program into guidelines for practice and analytics with which students and instructors can assess their discussion participation are presented. The analytics are both embedded in the learning environment and extracted from it, allowing for integrated and reflective metacognitive activity. The pedagogical intervention is based on the principles of (1) Integration (2) Diversity (of Metrics) (3) Agency (4) Reflection (5) Parity and (6) Dialogue. Details of an initial implementation of this approach and preliminary findings are described. Initial results strongly support the value of student-teacher dialogue around the analytics. In contrast, instructor parity in analytics use did not seem as important to students as was expected. Analytics were reported as useful in validating invisible discussion activity, but at times triggered emotionally-charged responses.},

This paper discusses these issues, relating them to an example construct, epistemic beliefs -- beliefs about the nature of knowledge -- for which analytics grounded in pragmatic, sociocultural theory might be well placed to explore. This example is particularly interesting given the role of epistemic beliefs in the everyday knowledge judgements students make in their information processing. Traditional psychological approaches to measuring epistemic beliefs have parallels with high stakes testing regimes; this paper outlines an alternative LA for epistemic beliefs which might be readily applied to other areas of interest. Such sociocultural approaches afford opportunity for engaging LA directly in high quality pedagogy.},

One of the most important tools employed during this process is language. In this paper we take exploratory dialogue, a joint form of co-reasoning, to be an external indicator that learning is taking place. Using techniques developed within the field of computational linguistics, we build on previous work using cue phrases to identify exploratory dialogue within online discussion. Automatic detection of this type of dialogue is framed as a binary classification task that labels each contribution to an online discussion as exploratory or non-exploratory. We describe the development of a self-training framework that employs discourse features and topical features for classification by integrating both cue-phrase matching and k-nearest neighbour classification. Experiments with a corpus constructed from the archive of a two-day online conference show that our proposed framework outperforms other approaches. A classifier developed using the self-training framework is able to make useful distinctions between the learning dialogue taking place at different times within an online conference as well as between the contributions of individual participants.},

Dyads in the treatment group achieved a higher quality of collaboration and a higher learning gain. In this paper, we describe how network analysis techniques can further illuminate these results, and contribute to the development of 'collaboration sensing'. More specifically, we describe two contributions: first, one can use networks to visualize and explore eye-tracking data. Second, network metrics can be computed to interpret the properties of the graph. We conclude with comments on implementing this approach for formal learning environments.},

The relationships between affect and learning outcomes have been previously studied, but not in a manner that is both longitudinal and finer-grained. Affect detectors are used to estimate student affective states based on post-hoc analysis of tutor log-data. For every student action in the tutor the detectors give us an estimated probability that the student is in a state of boredom, engaged concentration, confusion, and frustration, and estimates of the probability that they are exhibiting off-task or gaming behaviors. We ran the detectors on two years of log-data from 8th grade student use of the ASSISTments math tutoring system and collected corresponding end of year, high stakes, state math test scores for the 1,393 students in our cohort. By correlating these data sources, we find that boredom during problem solving is negatively correlated with performance, as expected; however, boredom is positively correlated with performance when exhibited during scaffolded tutoring. A similar pattern is unexpectedly seen for confusion. Engaged concentration and frustration are both associated with positive learning outcomes, surprisingly in the case of frustration.},

abstract = {This paper presents an eye-tracking study of notational, informational, and emotional aspects of nine different notational systems (Skill Meters, Smilies, Traffic Lights, Topic Boxes, Collective Histograms, Word Clouds, Textual Descriptors, Table, and Matrix) and three different information states (Weak, Average, & Strong) used to represent student's learning. Findings from the eye-tracking study show that higher emotional activation was observed for the metaphorical notations of traffic lights and smilies and collective representations. Mean view time was higher for representations of the "average" informational learning state. Qualitative data analysis of the think-aloud comments and post-study interview show that student participants reflected on the meaning-making opportunities and action-taking possibilities afforded by the representations. Implications for the design and evaluation of learning analytics representations and discourse environments are discussed.},

New media scholars posit that the participatory culture encouraged by social media gives rise to new forms of literacy skills that are vital to learning. However, there have been few attempts to use analytics to understand the new media literacy skills that may be embedded in an individual's participation in social media. In this paper, I collect raw activity data that was shared by an exploratory sample of Facebook users. I then utilize factor analysis and regression models to show how (a) Facebook members' online activity coalesce into distinct categories of social media behavior and (b) how these participatory behaviors correlate with and predict measures of new media literacy skills. The study demonstrates the use of analytics to understand the literacies embedded in people's social media activity. The implications speak to the potential of social learning analytics to identify and predict new media literacy skills from data streams in social media platforms.},

This paper focuses on work conducted at the Open University (OU) into predicting students who are at risk of failing their module. The Open University is one of the worlds largest distance learning institutions. Since tutors do not interact face to face with students, it can be difficult for tutors to identify and respond to students who are struggling in time to try to resolve the difficulty. Predictive models have been developed and tested using historic Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) activity data combined with other data sources, for three OU modules. This has revealed that it is possible to predict student failure by looking for changes in user's activity in the VLE, when compared against their own previous behaviour, or that of students who can be categorised as having similar learning behaviour. More focused analysis of these modules applying the GUHA (General Unary Hypothesis Automaton) method of data analysis has also yielded some early promising results for creating accurate hypothesis about students who fail.},

In this paper, we look at a specific data mining method, namely sequential pattern extraction, and we demonstrate an approach that exploits available linked open data for this interpretation task. Indeed, we show through a case study relying on data about students' enrolment in course modules how linked data can be used to provide a variety of additional dimensions through which the results of the data mining method can be explored, providing, at interpretation time, new input into the analytics process.},

This focus on completion rates, however, reflects a monolithic view of disengagement that does not allow MOOC designers to target interventions or develop adaptive course features for particular subpopulations of learners. To address this, we present a simple, scalable, and informative classification method that identifies a small number of longitudinal engagement trajectories in MOOCs. Learners are classified based on their patterns of interaction with video lectures and assessments, the primary features of most MOOCs to date.
In an analysis of three computer science MOOCs, the classifier consistently identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement. The most notable of these is the learners who stay engaged through the course without taking assessments. These trajectories are also a useful framework for the comparison of learner engagement between different course structures or instructional approaches. We compare learners in each trajectory and course across demographics, forum participation, video access, and reports of overall experience. These results inform a discussion of future interventions, research, and design directions for MOOCs. Potential improvements to the classification mechanism are also discussed, including the introduction of more fine-grained analytics.

Partly for this reason, and partly because of the relative newness of MOOCs as a widespread phenomenon, there is not yet a substantial body of literature on the learning analytics of MOOCs. However, one clear finding is that drop-out/non-completion rates are substantially higher than in more traditional education.
This paper explores these issues, and introduces the metaphor of a 'funnel of participation' to reconceptualise the steep drop-off in activity, and the pattern of steeply unequal participation, which appear to be characteristic of MOOCs and similar learning environments. Empirical data to support this funnel of participation are presented from three online learning sites: iSpot (observations of nature), Cloudworks ('a place to share, find and discuss learning and teaching ideas and experiences'), and openED 2.0, a MOOC on business and management that ran between 2010--2012. Implications of the funnel for MOOCs, formal education, and learning analytics practice are discussed.

Test cases were chosen using two methods: student-level stratification, and stratification based on the amount of trials ran during students' experimentation. We found that predictive performance of the models was different on each test set, revealing limitations that would have been missed from student-level validation alone.},

This paper presents the initial development of a systematic approach for interpreting and evaluating learner behaviors in OELEs called model-driven assessments, which uses a model of the cognitive and metacognitive processes important for completing the open-ended learning task. The model provides a means for both classifying and assessing students' learning behaviors while using the system. An evaluation of the analysis technique is presented in the context of Betty's Brain, an OELE designed to help middle school students learn about science.},

abstract = {Higher education institutions have collected and analysed student data for years, with their focus largely on reporting and management needs. A range of institutional policies exist which broadly set out the purposes for which data will be used and how data will be protected. The growing advent of learning analytics has seen the uses to which student data is put expanding rapidly. Generally though the policies setting out institutional use of student data have not kept pace with this change.
Institutional policy frameworks should provide not only an enabling environment for the optimal and ethical harvesting and use of data, but also clarify: who benefits and under what conditions, establish conditions for consent and the de-identification of data, and address issues of vulnerability and harm. A directed content analysis of the policy frameworks of two large distance education institutions shows that current policy frameworks do not facilitate the provision of an enabling environment for learning analytics to fulfil its promise.

It is expected that being able to put together different datasets from various applications will make it possible to support learning analytics of a much larger scale and across different contexts. We examine how this can be achieved from a practical perspective by carrying out a study that focuses on three real datasets. More specifically, we combine social data that has been collected from the users of three learning portals and reflect on how they should be handled. We start by studying the data types and formats that these portals use to represent and store social and usage data. Then we develop crosswalks between the different schemas, so that merged versions of the source datasets may be created. The results of this bottom-up, hands-on investigation reveal several interesting issues that need to be overcome before aggregated sets of social and usage data can be actually used to support learning analytics research or services.},

As by-product of service operation, Web logs capture and contextualize user interactions in a generic manner, in high detail, and on a massive scale. At the same time, we face inventions of data standards for capturing and encoding learner interactions tailored to learning analytics purposes. However, such standards are often focused on institutional and management perspectives or biased by their intended use. In this paper, we argue for Web logs as valuable data sources for learning analytics on all levels of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological System Theory and introduce a simple framework for Web log data enrichment, processing and further analysis. Based on an example data set from a management service for widget-based Personal Learning Environments, we illustrate our approach and discuss the applicability of different analysis techniques along with their particular benefits for learners.}.

Two game-inspired courses were developed at a high-enrollment public university in an effort to increase student engagement, and to provide students with more personalized learning experiences. We designed a learning management system, GradeCraft, to foreground the affordances of these grading systems, and to enhance the "game-like" experience for students. Along with serving as a translation layer for the grading systems of these courses, GradeCraft is also designed with an eye towards learning analytics, and captures information that can be described as student "process" data. Currently this data includes what types of assignments students choose to complete; how students assign percentage weights to their chosen assignments; how often and how accurately students check or model their course grades; and how successfully assignments are completed by students individually and the class as a whole across a structured grading rubric. We hope GradeCraft will give instructors new insight into student engagement, and provide data-driven ideas about how to tailor courses to student needs.},

To achieve their potential, personalized learning projects must move beyond individual, stand-alone projects or innovations to reshaping the institutional experience.
Learning science must connect with learning pedagogy and design. Learners and institutions must have access to tools and resources that assist in customizing student progress and supplemental learning needs. Teachers and faculty must be empowered to provide teaching and learning environments that allow individual students to thrive. All this will require unique partnerships and collaborations within and across institutions, incorporating the best learning science findings and bridging with public and private entities developing the learning and analytic tools to support personalized learning.
Crafting a strategy to embrace and sustain the transformative power of personalized learning systems will require strong leadership and clear planning models to align with institutional planning and future investments.

Written discourse is arguably the primary class of data that can give us insights into deeper learning and higher order qualities such as critical thinking, argumentation, mastery of complex ideas, empathy, collaboration and interpersonal skills. Moreover, the ability to write in a scholarly manner is a core competence, often taking the form of discourse with oneself and the literature. Computational linguistics research has developed a rich array of tools for machine interpretation of human discourse, but work to develop these tools in the context of learning is at a relatively early stage. Moreover, there is a significant difference between designing tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis, and their deployment on platforms to provide meaningful analytics for the learners and educators who are conducting that discourse. This workshop aims to catalyse ideas and build community connections among those who want to shape this field.

Also, OpenCourseware and other OER initiatives have contributed to making this ecosystem of resources richer. Very interesting insights can be extracted when studying the usage and social data that are produced within the learning collections, repositories and federations. At the same time, concerns for the quality and sustainability of these collections have been raised, which has lead to research on quality measurement and metrics. The Workshop attempts to bring studies and demonstrations for any kind of analysis done on learning resource collections, from an interdisciplinary perspective. We consider digital collections not as merely IT deployments but as social systems with contributors, owners, evaluators and users forming patterns of interactions on top of portals or through search systems embedded in other learning technology components. This is in coherence of considering these social systems under a Web Science approach (http://webscience.org/).
