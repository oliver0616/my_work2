As by-product of service operation, Web logs capture and contextualize user interactions in a generic manner, in high detail, and on a massive scale. At the same time, we face inventions of data standards for capturing and encoding learner interactions tailored to learning analytics purposes. However, such standards are often focused on institutional and management perspectives or biased by their intended use. In this paper, we argue for Web logs as valuable data sources for learning analytics on all levels of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological System Theory and introduce a simple framework for Web log data enrichment, processing and further analysis. Based on an example data set from a management service for widget-based Personal Learning Environments, we illustrate our approach and discuss the applicability of different analysis techniques along with their particular benefits for learners.."}

Our specific interest in analysis is the nature of collaborative planning behaviour and aspects of learning to learn together (L2L2). For that end we will describe the architecture supporting diverse analytic components across all the tools used in Metafora, the data formats, storage and access methods, and the analytic principles we designed and implemented. We will also describe our first insights using these methods on real Metafora data collected during practical experimentation in schools."}

These include referatories containing descriptions for resources in the Web (as MERLOT), aggregated collections (as Organic.Edunet), concrete initiatives as Khan Academy, repositories hosting and versioning modular content (as Connexions) and meta-aggregators (as Globe and Learning Registry). Also, OpenCourseware and other OER initiatives have contributed to making this ecosystem of resources richer. Very interesting insights can be extracted when studying the usage and social data that are produced within the learning collections, repositories and federations. At the same time, concerns for the quality and sustainability of these collections have been raised, which has lead to research on quality measurement and metrics. The Workshop attempts to bring studies and demonstrations for any kind of analysis done on learning resource collections, from an interdisciplinary perspective. We consider digital collections not as merely IT deployments but as social systems with contributors, owners, evaluators and users forming patterns of interactions on top of portals or through search systems embedded in other learning technology components. This is in coherence of considering these social systems under a Web Science approach (http://webscience.org/). "}
