Analytics is perceived as the potential decoder for institutional transformation. Given the mandates for improved assessment, accountability and performance, analytical tools are in high demand. A critical goal is to optimize student success by managing the student pipeline to success, eliminating structural and programmatic impediments to retention and success and by utilizing dynamic query, reporting, intervention and embedded predictive analytics to respond to at-risk behavior. Additional optimization practices are emerging as well: Expanded data mining, early-stage learner relationship management practices, and consideration of employability success. This panel presentation will describe the tools leading-edge institutions are using and what tools vendors are offering. The gap between supply and demand will be the main focus of the session."}

While these models explain how individuals learn in varying social dimensions, very few studies provide empirical validation of such models and extend them to include group learning and performance. In this exploratory study, we develop a theoretical model based on social learning and social network theories to understand how knowledge professionals engage in learning and performance, both as individuals and as groups. We investigate the association between egocentric network properties (structure, position and tie), 'content richness' in the social learning process and performance. Analysis from data collected using an online eLearning environment shows that rather than performance; social learning is influenced by properties of social network structure (density, inter-group and intra-network communication), relations (tie strength) and position (efficiency). Furthermore, individuals who communicate with others internal rather than external to the group show higher tendencies of social learning. The contribution of this study is therefore two-fold: a theoretical development of a social learning and networks based model for understanding learning and performance; and the construction of a novel metric called 'content richness' as a surrogate measure for social learning. In conclusion, a useful implication of the study is that the model fosters understanding social factors that influence learning and performance in the domain of learning analytics. It also begs the question of whether the relationship between social networks and performance is mediated or moderated by learning and whether assumptions of the model hold true in non-educational domains."}

Informal learning is an important driver for professional development and workplace learning. However powerful informal learning may be, there is a problem when it comes to making it a real asset within organizations: Informal learning activities are mostly invisible to others, sometimes the learners themselves might not even be aware of the learning that occurs. As a consequence informal learning in organizations goes undetected, remains off the radar of HR departments and is therefore hard to asses, manage and value [1]. This problem poses an interesting challenge for the field of Learning Analytics, namely finding ways to capture and analyse traces of (social) informal learning in every day life and work networks. Therefore empirical research and tools are needed that can raise awareness about informal learning activities to make it surface the radar, amplify the benefits of it and strengthen the social relations through which it occurs. In this paper we introduce a tool that aims to facilitate exactly this and we hope to stimulate to widen the discussion on Learning Analytics by expanding the field from a predominantly educational focus to informal and workplace learning. In this paper we will discuss methodologies that Learning Analytics can draw upon to make informal learning more explicit and accessible to analyse and to share amongst professionals."}

Such an approach makes complex inferences that may be hard to understand for users, and that are not necessarily accurate. We present MyExperiences, an open learner model designed for showing the users the inferences about them, as well as the underlying data. MyExperiences is one of the first open learner models based on tree maps. It constitutes an example of how research into open learner models and information visualization can be combined in an innovative way."}
