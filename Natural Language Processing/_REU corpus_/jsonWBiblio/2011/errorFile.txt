Abstract = {n recent years, studies into the reasons for dropping out of online higher education have been undertaken with greater regularity, parallel to the rise in the relative weight of this type of education, compared with brick-and-mortar education. However, the work invested in characterising the students who drop out of education, compared with those who do not, appears not to have had the same relevance as that invested in the analysis of the causes. The definition of dropping out is very sensitive to the context. In this article, we reach a purely empirical definition of student dropping out, based on the probability of not continuing a specific academic programme following several consecutive semesters of "theoretical break". Dropping out should be properly defined before analysing its causes, as well as comparing the drop-out rates between the different online programmes, or between online and on-campus ones. Our results show that there are significant differences among programmes, depending on their theoretical extension, but not their domain of knowledge.

Abstract = {We present new ways of detecting semantic relations between learning resources, e. g. for recommendations, by only taking their usage but not their content into account. We take concepts used in linguistic lexicology and transfer them from their original field of application, i. e. sequences of words, to the analysis of sequences of resources extracted from user activities. In this paper we describe three initial experiments, their evaluation and further work.}
