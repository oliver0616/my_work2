Recently, research started to investigate automated approaches for analysing reflective writing. Foundational to many automated approaches is the knowledge of words that are important for the genre. This research presents keywords that are specific to several categories of a reflective writing model. These keywords have been derived from eight datasets, which contain several thousand instances using the log-likelihood method. Both performance measures, the accuracy and the Cohen's Îº, for these keywords were estimated with ten-fold cross validation. The results reached an accuracy of 0.78 on average for all eight categories and a fair to good interrater reliability for most categories even though it did not make use of any sophisticated rule-based mechanisms or machine learning approaches. This research contributes to the development of automated reflective writing analytics that are based on data-driven empirical foundations.Substantial progress has been made in understanding how teachers design for learning. However, there remains a paucity of evidence of the actual students' response towards leaning designs. Learning analytics has the power to provide just-in-time support, especially when predictive analytics is married with the way teachers have designed their course, or so-called a learning design. This study investigates how learning designs are configured over time and their impact on student activities by analyzing longitudinal data of 38 modules with a total of 43,099 registered students over 30 weeks at the Open University UK, using social network analysis and panel data analysis. Our analysis unpacked dynamic configurations of learning designs between modules over time, which allows teachers to reflect on their practice in order to anticipate problems and make informed interventions. Furthermore, by controlling for the heterogeneity between modules, our results indicated that learning designs were able to explain up to 60% of the variability in student online activities, which reinforced the importance of pedagogical context in learning analytics."}

An IA-OER is characterized by its alignment with the Universal Design Learning (UDL) principles, the quality on its contents and the web accessibility as a way to address the diversity of students. Creating an IA-OER with these characteristics is not a straightforward task, especially when teachers do not have enough information/feedback to make decisions on how to improve the learning contents. In this paper we introduce ATCE - an Analytics Tool to Trace the Creation and Evaluation of IA-OERs. This tool focuses in particular on the accessibility and quality of the IA-OERs. ATCE was developed as a module within the ATutor Learning Management System (LMS). An analytics dashboard with visualizations related to the teachers' competences in the creation and evaluation of IA-OERs was included as part of the tool. This paper also presents a use case of the visualizations obtained from the creation and evaluation of one IA-OER after using our analytics tool."}

The results show that more considerations need to be given to establishing communication channels among stakeholders and adopting pedagogy-based approaches to learning analytics. It also reveals the shortage of guidance for developing data literacy among end-users and evaluating the progress and impact of learning analytics. Moreover, the review highlights the need to establish formalised guidelines to monitor the soundness, effectiveness, and legitimacy of learning analytics. As interest in learning analytics among higher education institutions continues to grow, this review will provide insights into policy and strategic planning for the adoption of learning analytics"}

The DesignLAK17 workshop builds on the DesignLAK16 workshop to explore one aspect of this theme, namely the opportunities arising from the use of analytics in scaled assessment design. New paradigms for learning design are exploiting the distinctive characteristics and potentials of analytics, trace data and newer kinds of sensory data usable on digital platforms to transform assessment. But, characteristics of quality assessment design need to be reconsidered, and new metrics for capturing quality are required. This symposium and workshop focuses on what might be appropriate quality metrics and indicators for assessment design in scaled learning. It aims to build a community of interest round the topic, to share perspectives, and to generate design and research ideas."}

Aided by big data coming from learning content management and massive open online course systems, these researchers have an unparalleled opportunity for insight into the teaching and learning process. In this paper we summarize some of the challenges and opportunities arising out of three workshops on Educational Discourse. These workshops convened both expert and emerging scholars to discuss the (i) ethical, (ii) technical, and (iii) infrastructure barriers to building a research community focused on computer-mediated educational discourse. Of particular note is that while computational infrastructure exists for storing and manipulating educational discourse, there is a need for a sociotechnical infrastructure upon which community members can come together to engage in joint work."}

Skill2vec is a neural network architecture which can transform a skill to a new vector space called embedding. The embedding can facilitate the comparison and visualization of different skills and their relationship. We conducted a pilot experiment using benchmark dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}
