INTRODUCTION: LEARNING AND  DISCOURSE  A key indicator of meaningful learning is the quality of   contribution to discourse. As proposed by Mercer [1], a   sociocultural perspective on learning highlights the possibility   that educational success and failure may be explained by the   quality of educational dialogue, rather than simply in terms of the   capability of individual students or the skill of their teachers.   The way in which learners engage in dialogue is an indicator of   how they engage with other learners ideas, how they compare   those ideas with their personal understanding, and finally how   they account for their point of view, which is an explicit sign of   the stance they hold in the conversation.    The analysis of accounts in text is the primary focus of discourse   analysis. We look at discourse as a key indicator for learning and   explore discourse analysis as a method to identify where and how   learning happens. This approach to analyzing dialogue, in search   of clues and indicators of learning, builds on the tradition of   scholarly and scientific discourse. Gilbert and Muckay [2]   pioneered this field by analyzing the way scientists construct   their claims and defend their positions in a scientific dispute.   Information and data, together with experimental procedures,   subsequent results and theoretical developments are not   univocally observable, and can present a variety of significant   interpretations which may be conflicting, while at the same time   being equally valid. Within this space of multiple   interpretations, appropriate forms of rhetorical move in language   are the means by which scientists make their claims to contribute   to scientific debate and advance knowledge.    Discourse analysis focuses explicitly on language as social   action, and in that, discourse and argumentation are the tools   through which people can compare their thinking, explore ideas,   shape agreement, and identify or solve disagreements. We use   discourse to co-evolve and think together. Many human   activities involve not just the sharing of information and the   coordination of social interaction, but also a joint, dynamic   engagement with ideas amongst partners. When working   together, we do not only interact, we interthink [3]. Mercer   focuses attention on the relationship of dialogue processes to   outcomes: if discourse is the tool through which learners think   collectively, then discourse outcomes and discourse analysis can   provide indicators to better understand the learning processes.   While Mercer and others originally focused on spoken dialogue   as a tool for thinking collectively, their work has been shown   subsequently to provide insight into textual discourse in online   learning [4], providing a bridge to the world of online learning   analytics for knowledge building.   Argumentation Theory is a second strand of work on which we   build, given the importance of reflection and critical thinking in   learning discourse. While argumentation and rhetorical theory   date back to the Greek philosophers, we draw particular   inspiration from the foundational work of Walton in articulating   many of the argumentation schemes that we encounter in   everyday discourse [5].

Copyright 2011 ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-1057-4/11/02$10.00.     23    Walton, et al. for computational modeling [6] provides the   technical bridge required for learning analytics.    The third strand of work informing our approach derives from   Rittels formative work on Issue-Based Information Systems and   his argumentative method for sensemaking deliberation in   complex problem spaces [7]. Its subsequent translation by   Conklin [8] into a hypertext data model supporting dialogue   visualization provides the third key bridge for learning analytics.   We build on these three research strands and argue that if   learning dialogues and their outcomes are representative   indicators to better scaffold the learning process [1,3], then   argumentation theory [5,6] and argumentation tools [7] can   improve the ways in which those processes can be analyzed and   understood.    2. THE MOVE TO SEMANTICALLY  STRUCTURED ONLINE DISCOURSE  Written discourse in online learning environments is expressed   in diverse corpora such as learning journals, discussions,   reviews, and essays, rendered via myriad tools such as threaded   forums, blogs, wikis and social networking sites. Each tool   constrains and shapes the ways in which users can articulate   their thoughts and dialogue with one another. Those aspects   makes online discourse and dialogue quite different from face-to-  face dialogue and a specific clarification needs to be done of   what type of online dialogue is being considered, how people can   dialogue in those environments and how discourse and discourse   analysis may be interpreted in the specific space of online   communication which is being investigated.    The most established online dialogue environments render   discourse chronologically, rather than logically, reflecting most   strongly the sequence of contributions rather than their   conceptual structure (for instance a Facebook dialogue, Figure   1).           Figure 1. Extract of a real Facebook Dialogue.   Subject-line threading, tagging, or anchoring commentary to a   document structure do provide mechanisms, albeit weak, to   navigate thematically. Such environments minimize the effort   required by the user to add a contribution (they just click   comment or reply), but the trade-off is that important   phenomena that can signify more reflective learning   conversations are hidden in the free-text content, making it   harder for both participants, and the software platform, to   understand questions such as: What are the key issues raised in   the conversation What are the emerging questions How much   support is there for this idea Who disagrees, and what evidence   do they use What kind of argument is made to support this One   must simply read the entire online conversation, along with all   the noise which cannot be filtered.      Figure 2. Shows how Cohere augment common online   dialogue text: the icons at the side of each post shows   rhetorical role of the post and the semantic connections the   rhetorical move between posts.   In order to address these limitations, we are now seeing the   emergence of robust tools for more structured deliberation and   argument mapping [9-11], prefigured by extensive CSCL   research [12-13]. These tools are now finding application in   many forms of knowledge work which require clear thinking and   debate, including learning, scenario planning, and policy   formulation. As part of our broader conception of Hypermedia   Discourse [14], we have developed a web application called   Cohere [15], providing a medium for engaging in structured   online discourse, or for summarising/analysing it, e.g. as a   moderator, educator or researcher. Following the approach of   structured deliberation/argument mapping, Cohere renders   annotations on the web, or a discussion, as a network of   rhetorical moves: users must reflect on, and make explicit, the   nature of their contribution to a discussion. A simple example   illustrates how a Cohere discussion is different from typical   social network interaction, such as in Facebook (Figure1). In the   example dialogue (Figure 1), Van has proposed a dinner for the   10th of October which Miriam cannot attend, while Anna and   Aurelie can make it. From how the dialogue is represented, it is   not evident at first that the central dinner-invitation post is the   second one, nor what the positions of other participants are.    24       Figure 3. Coheres environment in which online dialogue is represented as semantic network of posts.   The only way to make sense of the conversation is by reading it   whole. While this is feasible with just three participants and 5   posts, this does not scale for complex debates with many   participants.    Cohere aims to address this problem with two key extensions:    Adding icon types to the posts    Making semantic connections between posts (see Figure  2).   With Cohere, users can pick an icon to associate to their post,   which explain the rhetorical role of that post in the wider   conversation (e.g. Van is raising and idea/option to make a   dinner on Friday, Miriam presents a con to the proposal: since   she has guests that w-e, Anna present a pro in favor of Van   proposal: there will be no Lab dinner in that w-e, etc) (Figure 2).   Moreover with Cohere users can explicitly connect their post to   the post which is relevant to what they want to say. They can do   so by making a connection between posts, which explain the   rhetorical move they want to make in the conversation (i.e. Anna   and Aurelie agree with Vans idea while Miriam disagrees)   (Figure 2).   Cohere augments the online conversation by making explicit   information on the rhetorical function and relationship between   posts. Moreover users can browse the online dialogue not as a   linear text but as a semantic network of posts (Figure 3).   By structuring and representing online discourse as semantic   network of posts Cohere enables a whole new way to browse,   make sense of, and analyze the online discourse. In this paper we   discuss what it mean to use Coheres online dialogue   environment to monitor online learning activities and develop   useful learning analytics, by starting on the analysis of the online   discourse which learners are involved in.   In particular in the next section we describe how discourse   analytics can enable a deeper understanding of the online   discourse, of the participants to the discourse and the social and   learning dynamics.   3. LEARNING ANALYTICS ON  DISCOURSE ELEMENTS  In the previous sections we have described why discourse is a   key indicator for learning (section 1), and we have described the   specific type and technology for online discourse we will be   focusing on: Cohere (section 2). In the following we present   several examples of simple learning analytics based on discourse   elements. These examples are intended to work as a proof of   concept for the potential of discourse-centered learning analytics   that is to say a focus on learners' discourse as promising site to   identify patterns of meaningful learning.   Cohere introduces two main discourse elements in an online   conversation:   1. The post type: which is represented with an icon   and label, and expresses the rhetorical role played   by the post in the wider online conversation (Figure   2 and 3);   2. The semantic connection: that is represented by a   link and label, and expresses the rhetorical move   the author of the post wanted to make in the   conversation, and toward a specific post or   participant (Figure 2 and 3).   25    In the following we describe what kind of learning analytics can   be done on those two discourse elements and give concrete   examples of how Cohere can provide learning analytics per   learner and per group, to identify:    learners attention: what do learners focus on What  problems and questions they raised, what comments   they made, what viewpoints they expressed etc.     learners rhetorical attitude to discourse contributions:  With what and who do a learner agrees/disagrees   What ideas he supports What data he questioned      learning topics distribution: What are the hottest  learning topics, by who they have been proposed and   discussed     learners social interactions: How do learners act  within a discussion group What are the relationships   between learners    4. ANALYTICS PER LEARNER  Cohere provides two main types of learning analytics: analytics   per learner and analytics per group. In the following we discuss   the main analytics per learner which consist of two tables (Node   Type table and Link type table); and two lists of connections   (comparing thinking and information brokering connection list).   We will use as example data the statistic for Rebecca, a semi-  experienced Cohere user, which has been also involved in one of   the use cases described in the following section (section 5).    4.1 Analytics on Post Types: Analyzing  Rhetorical Roles   The table on post types (called node types) counts, shows the   variety of types of posts that the learner has added to the   conversation, and with how many posts of each type he has   contributed. Statistics on node types measure the rhetorical role   of the comment that the learners are making, (e.g. Does she ask   many Questions Does she contribute Data, or just Ideas) and   therefore provide an indicator of learners attention and   performance.   For instance higher the number of created posts, higher the   learners engagement in the discussion: for instance a higher   number of theory type posts may indicate a learners interest in   theoretical issues. Statistics on the node type can be also   interpreted as a way to classify the role of that learner in the   group. For instance, does he work as the person providing   answer He could be imagined as a point of reference-tutor.    If we look at a concrete example, in Figure 4, Rebecca has   contributed mainly with ideas, general opinions, and she has   offered several international perspectives on the conversation.   We may also notice that in just three posts she has raised   questions.   By looking at the node type table it is possible to evaluate   learners performance connecting the discourse outcomes with   the specific learning goal. For instance, there may be learning   scenarios in which the learning goal is to share online resources,   therefore in those cases the scores on Data posts type would   offer a useful figure on how the learner performed in this task.   With the post types table, Cohere draws a picture on the kind and   quantity of contributions to the conversation that the learner has   given and therefore, in different learning scenarios, it may enable   inferences on how the learner has performed in the specific   learning task.       Figure 4. Node types table: shows the different typologies in   which the learner classified his posts, and the counts of how   many times each type had been used in the conversation.   4.2 Analytics on Link Types: Analyzing  Rhetorical Moves   The table on link types (Figure 5) describes the rhetorical   moves that the learner has made in the conversation. It gives the   list of all link types, used by that learner, to express his ideas and   connect them with other peoples ideas. The list will be ordered   as descending on the number of time the semantic link has been   used.    Three main elements can be observed by looking at this table: the   language the learner uses to describe his thinking, his attitude   toward the discussed topic, and how this language and attitude   are similar or different from other learners in the same group.   In order to evaluate learners attitude Cohere classifies semantic   links type into three categories: Positive, Neutral and Negative   (Figure 5). Positive link types are represented with a green link   and label, and express positive rhetorical moves such as i.e.   supports, agrees with, improves on, is consistent with, predicts,   proves, solves the problem etc.      Figure 5. Link types usage statistics. Arrows show three   connections categories - Neutral, Positive and Negative      26    These categories provide indicators of the attitude a learner had   toward the learning task and within the conversation. In example,   in the figure shown (Figure 5), we can see that the example   learner has maintained a positive stance within the conversation.   In fact, in Figure 5 green links score quite high into the table and   the most of the learners contributions to the conversation have   been devoted to identify: consistencies, coherences, answers to   questions raised by herself or other learners etc.               More precise statistics can be easily obtained from this table. For   example, the percentage of positive contribution can be   calculated as:    %P  is equal to the summation of the number of times that the   learner used a green link ( Ngl ), extended to all the green links   (g=1,..G; where G is the number of different green links type),   divided for the total number of links he has created (T), and   multiplied by 100.   This percentage can be used as an indicator of the learners   positive attitude toward the learning task, and toward other   learners, within the online discourse.   The same calculation can be repeated for neutral and   negative link types. This would give the following analytics for   our example learner (Table 1).   These statistics can be extended to all learners in a class or in a   group of inquiry and therefore compare their attitude within the   online conversation.   Table 1. Example of Link Type Analytics for a learner      %P: Percentage of   Positive rhetorical   moves   %N: Percentage   of Negative   rhetorical moves   %Ntl: Percentage   of Neutral   rhetorical moves    47.1 9.5 43.4   The second observation, that can be made analyzing the link   types table (Figure 6), concerns the learners language used to   describe their rhetorical moves. Different learners may give   different meaning, or nuances of meaning, to the same concept   and this may mirror in using different terms to express the same   concept, or the same term while referring to quite different   meaning.    If we look at Rebeccas list of rhetorical moves, we can notice   that she classified as gray (neutral) rhetorical moves which refer   to descriptive turns in the conversation, aiming to: i.e. identify   similarities, illustrate, give examples and discover relationships.   And the classification is quite coherent, in the sense that all the   link types she has chosen convey the same descriptive meaning.   In the same way, the green links seem to represent positive   moves such as: improvement, support, problem solving etc. We   may notice though that she classified as positive the relationship   causes, which has a quite ambiguous interpretation. In fact   other learners may have classified causes as neutral link type   since causal moves may imply both positive and negative   consequences and therefore the term does not bring per se a   positive interpretation. Presented with link analytics of this sort,   an educator might ask questions such as: Why did Rebecca   classify this term as green How did other users interpret this   rhetorical move   Comparison between different learners link types table, and   different analytics on the data can support the understanding of   those deeper reflections on learners use of language. For   example, Figure 6 shows how four users who all participated in   the same investigation, used the five link types which were   calculated to have highest usage within the group.          Figure 6. Comparing four users usage of link types.   Usage is a relative metric, which may be constrained to specific   users group, or to specific users type (I.e experts, or non-expert).   For instance, if we want to calculate the usage of a semantic link   type by the most expert Cohere users, we can calculate the   weighted summation of the number of time the link type has   been used from the top 20 users, following the formula:   Where:    i is the semantic link type, and varies from i=1,..n;   where n is the number of all the different semantic   connections type used by the top 20 Cohere users.    u is the user and vary from 1,..20 for the top 20 Cohere  users    Nui with u=1,..20 is the number of times the user u  has used the connection i;     and the weights wi are obtained by calculating the  topological matrix of semantic-type/user and summing   the row elements to obtain the number of users which   used that same link type.    In other words, for each link type i, the weight wi is  proportional to the number of users that used that link type. The   weight is a measure of popularity of each link type within the top   20 expert Cohere users, and the more popular is a link type the   more it will score in the Usage calculation. By applying this   formula we choose popularity as the main factor to determine if a   semantic link type is used, in other words we make sure that if   %P =  Ngl gl=1  G    T *100    1)      U i = wiNui u=1  20   .   (2)      27    just one user has used a semantic link type many times, but   nobody else has, this link type will not score high in the link type   usage.    4.3 Learners Attitude to Compare Thinking  An important aspect of learning is the capability of the learner to   think critically and reflect on his personal point of view by   comparing it with others. When a learner decides to connect his   idea with another persons idea this could serve as an indicator   of reflective thinking, insofar as the learner is assumed to have   read the target node, and reasoned about the relationship with his   own idea, in order to select a link type.    Cohere counts and lists for each learner all the links in which she   has connected his opinion to another persons contribution to the   online conversation (Figure 7). In the picture we can see that for   each connection there are three user icons, which represent:  the   links author (at the center under the semantic connection label)   and the authors of the two posts that are being connected.   Compared thinking statistics counts the connections in which the   link author (at the center) is also author of one of the two   connected posts.      Figure 7. List of semantic connections in which learners have   compared their thinking with other learners.   4.4 Learners as Information Brokers   Another analytic afforded by semantic discourse of this sort   concerns the degree to which users act as information brokers   between others.       Figure 8. List of semantic connections in which a learner   acted as information brokers.   Since connecting is an explicit, reflective act in Cohere, it is   straightforward to count how many times learners create   semantic connections between nodes authored by others. Those   connections are then listed as in Figure 8.      5. DISCOURSE NETWORK ANALYSES  AND VISUALIZATION: ANALYTICS PER   ONLINE DISCUSSION GROUP     Cohere calculates different kinds of statistics on online data   generated and shared by group members. The group statistics   summary shows two main factors:    Discourse element statistics, such as the most popular  link type and the most popular node type     Discourse network statistics, such as i.e. the node type,  the post and the learner with highest degree   centrality.   Let us elaborate the properties of the discourse network. Its   structure consists of two superimposed networks that are   assumed to be strongly connected:    Concept network  which relates the nodes that  learners created.    Social network  which relates learners that participate  to Cohere discussions posting Ideas, Questions and   Arguments etc;   For data analysis we considered that, in the concept network, the   posts are the nodes, and the semantic relations among posts   indicate the edges; whereas the social network maps the pattern   of relationships among actors. In particular, we considered the   users as nodes and we measured the edge between two users by   counting the times that a user created a semantic connection that   targeted a post authored by another user.    In the following tables, we show the different meaning that each   Network Analysis metric has in the social and concept network   adapted to our context.   In order to provide some concrete examples of how the above   network metrics can be used to analyze learners activities in   online discussion groups we present two use cases.    In the first use case (OLnet team discussion) Cohere has been   used by a group of researchers to annotate the document of a   project proposal, and to reflect on which areas of the proposal   they were making a contribution. With Coheres Firefox sidebar   users can annotate the document and share their annotation in the   group discussion environments. These annotations are initially   presented as list of posts presented in reverse chronological order   within the discussion group. After this initial phase of reading   and annotating the document, participants were asked to have a   group discussion on the main research questions addressed by the   team, the main project achievements and how they related to the   project goal. In order to do this, they had to create new posts in   which they described more general reflections on research   questions, goals and activities and then they had to start creating   semantic connections between the document annotations and the   posts (for more info on the Coheres user interface and how to   build semantic connections and discourse networks through   Cohere please refer to [16,17]).   This resulted into a discourse network in which document notes,   open questions, ideas and other posts type are connected, and   28    nodes icons and links express the rhetorical role and move   played by each post into the online discourse.    Table 2. Ego-network measurements   Metric Social Network Concept Network   Outdegree   Measures most   active users. It   measure the   activity of a user in   terms of how many   posts s/he has   linked   Measures the   attractiveness of a   post in terms of how   many posts it has   been linked to   Indegree   Measures Prestige   and   Expertise of the   learner within the   network   Measures the   attractiveness of the   post in terms of how   many incoming links   it has.

It   considers the kind of   node to which a post   is connected to.

Results of the web annotations have then   been used to inform an online dialogue on the main issues   tackled during COP15, as reported by the press or as micro and   macro blogged by participants to the conference.    In order to have a specific focus for the discussion participants   choose to discuss one of the public's top questions that have been   suggested on a Open University Platform (see page:   http://www.open.ac.uk/platform/join-in/your-votes/question-by-  popular/Climate%20Change); that is:    How do we know that climate change is real and we're   not just experiencing a weather cycle   Participants were asked to explore and annotate key Open   Educational Resources (OER) and Social Media pages (such as   Blogs, Wikis, Twitter streams, and web pages in general) with   ideas to help answering the tackled question. Moreover they   were asked to make connections between their ideas and other   participants ideas. In this process the main driving question and   the identified relevant OERs have been used as evidences to base   claims/ideas. This resulted in a web of ideas and annotated   resources on the issues at stake, meaningfully connected into a   discourse network.   In the next paragraph we will describe how statistic on discourse   network can provide insights on the contents of the group   discussion and on the conceptual and social interaction between   group members.   To analyze both the online group discussions and to compute   some of above mentioned Network Analytics, we used UCINET   tool [18]; instead we used NodeXL tool [19] for both concept   network and social network visualization.    5.1 Concept Network Analysis and  Visualization    5.1.1 Link distribution: Is the network topology hub  and spoke or random  The first analysis that we conducted on the datasets of the two   use cases looks at links distribution to assess the presence of hub   users and hub topics. The existence of hubs indicates the   presence of hot topics/posts or key/most-active users. Networks   hubs are nodes with the highest degree centrality. From the   analysis of link distribution, emerges that both OLnet and Cop15   discussion groups are characterized by a power law distribution.   The power law tail indicates that the probability of funding posts   with a large number of links is rather significant; this means that   the network connectivity is dominated by few highly connected   posts [20].   As illustrated in the two histograms below (Figure 9), in both the   network it is possible to identify a hub with a highest degree   followed by smaller ones. From the analysis emerges that the hub   is a post labeled #COP15 and classified as idea type. The hub   post has been connected to many other posts, which present   annotations of various web resources. The learner who created   the post was in fact using the hub to cluster those resources   under the # tag COP15. This highlights a use of Cohere in   which the learner, more than dialoguing is rather mapping out   his notes on web resources and then sharing them with the group   within the online discourse.   29    A different case is the OLnet discussion group, which highlights   a use of Cohere as tool for collective inquiry. In fact the   discussion presents two hubs, both with degree equal to 8:    What motivates registered users to learn in socio-  collaborative ways on OpenLearn  which was   classifies by the author as idea type post; and     How can we build a robust evidence base to support   and enhance the design, evaluation and use of OERs   which has been classified as a question type post.   The first thing that we can notice is that the two hubs are both   posts which present an open question to the group. This seems to   suggest that within all posts types, questions have a higher   discourse power, in that they trigger learners participation and   interactions. Of course more systematic observations on wider   and different online discussion groups are needed to   appropriately test this hypothesis. Other considerations can be   also done by looking at the hub posts type. The learner who   authored the first hub did not correctly classify the rhetorical role   of his post within the wider conversation.         Figure 9. Link distribution histograms for COP15 and OLnet Team discussion groups.     The post clearly states a question but it has been classified as   idea. This may be due to misunderstanding of the learning task   or to less confidence in the use of the technology; in any case this   observation would alert a tutor on the learner performance. This   example, in the same line with the analysis done in section 4.1,   highlight the value of using posts type to classify the rhetorical   role of the posts within the online conversation.    5.1.2 Components analysis to compare the  struceture of OLnet and Cop 15: Are the networks   connected  The second analysis which has been conducted on the two   datasets consists in assessing the presence of components. A   component is a connected subset that composes a disconnected   network. Within networks components there are no links/paths   between the nodes belonged to different components. Therefore   network components identify isolated subsets of people or topics   within the discourse network.   If we look at the social network this analysis assesses the degree   to which a network is disconnected: for instance: a social network   which is fully connected has only one component. While if we   look at the concept network the analysis assesses the number of   different subtopics discussed in a group and at the same   time.From the analysis emerges that both networks present   several components and this implies that the networks are   weakly connected. In details, COP15 group presents 9   components but the bulk of nodes belong to two components.   OLnet group presents 10 components but the bulk of nodes   belong to one component. The presence of components in each   group can be interpreted as the emergence of different sub-  discussions independent among them. Analyzing the size of each   component, (number of node in each component) emerges that   not all the sub-discussions are developed by learners in the same   way. Bigger components can be interpreted as hot sub-topics   which attracts a greater interest than others. We can also notice   that the number of posts in the group discussion may have an   influence on how hub topics distribute. For instance if we   compare the two groups we can notice that in more developed   discussion groups, such as COP15 group, two components absorb   the bulk of nodes (161 out of 178). While in a group with less   posts, as OLnet group, the bigger component absorb less than   45% of the total nodes. This could indicate that at the beginning   of the discussion, learners try to explore a wider deliberation   space talking about different aspects of the same topic; then   gradually, they start to focus on few sub-topics and to deepen   them. This hypothesis would need to be proof/disproved by more   in depth analysis, but consideration on the line of these give an   example of how analyzing network metrics can inform the   understanding of group dynamics. Finally specific network   visualizations can be drawn to focus on the main network   analysis metrics (Fig. 10).   Figure 10 shows results of the concept network visualization for   the OLnet Team discussion group, done with NodeXL [19].    In particular in Figure 10:    Edge shape depends on link type (Positive=solid line;  Neutral=dotted line, Negative=dashed lines)    Edge width depends on the frequency of the  relationship    Vertex size depends on the degree centrality.   30      Figure 10. Concept Network Visualization of OLnet team discussion).      5.2 Social Network Analysis and Visualization  One approach to studying collaborative environment, as well as   collaborative network, has been the application of Social   Network Analysis.   The phrase social network refers to the set of actors and the   ties among them. The network analyst would seek to model these   relationships to depict the structure of a group. One could then   study the impact of this structure on behaviour of the group   and/or the influence of this structure on individuals within the   group [21].    Focusing on depicting the structure of the network, the paper   applies the main structural measures of SNA to Cohere   discourse network in order to analyze the typology of network   which emerges from the online discussions.     In the following we present the Social Network Analysis (SNA)   for the OLnet discussion group. The SNA measurements that we   consider in our analysis are: out degree and in degree centrality.   We adapted the meaning of these two measures to our case,   indeed:    Out degree measures the users activity level;    In degree is a sort of indirect measure of quality and  relevance of a users posts.   In the table (Table 5), we show the results that emerge from the   analysis of OLnet group social network.    The node more active is Learner 1. Her outdegree is equal to 11.   It means that she creates 11 links among different posts. While,   Learner 6 is the learner with the higher indegree value. Her   indegree is equal to 11. It means that L6s posts are considered   more interesting and/or relevant by the group.    By using the network metrics detailed in Table 2 the SN of the   OLnet Team discussion group can be represented as follows   (Figure 11, NodeXL tools visualization [19]). In particular in   figure 11:    Link width indicates the frequency of relationship  (reply).    Edge shape indicates the link type (positive: solid line,  neutral: dotted line, negative: dashed line). The final   shape depends on the prevalence of one of two link   type.    Vertex size depends on the in-degree centrality of each  users (bigger node have higher out-degree centrality).   Vertex colour depends on the out-degree centrality (more black   sphere have a higher in-degree value instead grey node have   lower indegree value   Table 5.

CONCLUSIONS  Drawing on Mercers socio-cultural discourse analysis and   argumentation theory, we have motivated a focus on learners   discourse as a promising site for identifying patterns of activity   which correspond to meaningful learning and knowledge   construction. However, in order for online discourse to deliver on   the promise of learning analytics, software platforms must gain   access to qualitative information about the pragmatic dimensions   of conversational contributions, that is, the rhetorical dimensions   to a contribution.    We identified the emergence in recent years of more-structured   deliberation platforms on the Web, descended from hypertext   research systems in the 1980s.    Users of such tools make explicit certain classes of information   which is very difficult to extract from naturally occurring text,   although we are now investigating computational linguistics tools   for detecting rhetorical gestures [22].    In particular, we are interested in the rhetorical role that a users   contribution is making to a document or conversation (e.g.   identifying a problem, responding to a query, challenging or   supporting a viewpoint, contributing new data), and the nature of   the connection to other contributions using semantic   relationships. Using the Cohere system as an experimental   vehicle, we have presented examples of learning analytics at the   level of individual learners and groups to better understand:    learners attention: by analyzing the specific type and  quantity of contributions to the conversation that a   learner gives it is possible to measure several aspects   of the learner performance (section 4);    learners rhetorical moves within the online discussion:  By analyzing the semantic connections between posts   we can enhance our understanding  on the different   ways in which learners participate to the conversation.   Moreover we can make consideration on what attitude   they have toward the discussed topic and the role they   play within the group (section 4);    learning topics distribution: by applying concept  network analysis we can identify what are the hottest   learning topics and by who they have been proposed   and discussed. Moreover we can see how topic and   subtopic distribute within the online conversation   (section 5);    learners social interactions: by applying SNA we can  map how learners  act within a discussion group, what   are the relationships between learners, where and how   much they interacted with each other, and who is the   key learner and why (section 5).   These examples dont aim to present in depth analysis of the   collected use case data, they are rather meant to give a proof of   concept of the potential impact of discourse-centric learning   analytics in the study of CSCL.  Based on those examples we   argue that discourse-centric learning analytics such as these   enable more in-depth reflections on learners activities than   would be possible to achieve with quantitative analysis of lower   level actions (such as mining of logs on how many resources are   downloaded, how many times they have logged into a system,   how many comments they have made, how long they have spent   on a task, etc).    This is partially due to the nature of the analyzed data.   Discourse-centric learning analytics are based on data that makes   explicit the learners cognitive context (e.g. what kind of   rhetorical move the learner wanted to make with a comment,   what meaning he gave to a connection, what contrasting   viewpoints he detected etc). By analyzing more richly expressed   and structured data, discourse-centered analytics can augment the   level of accuracy and the cognitive depth of the inferences that   can be made on where and how learning happens.    32    7.
