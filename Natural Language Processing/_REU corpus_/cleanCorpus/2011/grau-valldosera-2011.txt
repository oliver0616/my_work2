However, the work  invested in characterising the students who drop out of education,  compared with those who do not, appears not to have had the  same relevance as that invested in the analysis of the causes. The  definition of dropping out is very sensitive to the context. In this  article, we reach a purely empirical definition of student dropping  out, based on the probability of not continuing a specific academic  programme following several consecutive semesters of  theoretical break. Dropping out should be properly defined  before analysing its causes, as well as comparing the drop-out  rates between the different online programmes, or between online  and on-campus ones. Our results show that there are significant  differences among programmes, depending on their theoretical  extension, but not their domain of knowledge.

INTRODUCTION From an institutional perspective, university dropping out is very  important, as dropping out needs to be seen as a failure of the  university system to generate product (graduates) with an  important quantity of public resources invested. In the analysis  made in this paper  and based on the specific definition of  dropping out presented in it  we see that during the first 26  semesters, the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Open University   of Catalonia, UOC) received 62,450 new students enrolled in  officially recognised degrees in Catalan; 13.3% of them finished a  degree and 57.6% dropped out of their studies. These figures only  include students who have been enrolled a certain number of  semesters large enough to establish a criterion for dropping out,  the main goal of this paper. In fact, establishing the exact moment  when a student can be considered a drop-out is part of this goal.  Dropping out is a highly relevant phenomenon that deserves to be  analysed in detail. Furthermore, it is difficult to establish  comparisons with other centres given the specificities of the UOC,  a purely online distance university.   One of the challenges posed to universities, be they brick-and- mortar or distance, is to define the concept of dropping out. The  main difficulty lies in the fact that, faced with several successive  semesters of non-enrolment by a student, it cannot be said with  100% assurance that this student has definitively dropped out of  their studies, as it may happen that he or she is taking a longer or  shorter break; this difficulty is even greater in distance studies,  where the profile of the majority of students has more work and  family commitments than that of brick-and-mortar type university  students and where, therefore, the existence of breaks seems much  more likely. Additionally, it should be considered that the official  definition of dropping out, that is, the one given for public  universities in Spain, does not reflect the particularities of online  higher education.    The main aim of this paper is to define dropping out in online  higher education following an inductive process based on an  objective analysis of enrolment and non-enrolment (i.e. breaks)  data of all students in officially recognised degrees in Catalan at  the UOC between 1996 and 2008. The definition reached using  this methodology could possibly be valid for the majority of  teaching institutions that offer studies of a certain duration and  with non-obligatory enrolment. In particular, it would be highly  adaptable to institutions offering distance university education  that accept the possibility of their students taking breaks.  Dropping out analysis requires a certain historical database in  order to be accurate. In this sense, the UOC, despite being a very  young and pioneering university in the field of virtual education,  has already been in existence for fifteen years and has, at present,  almost  35,000 active students in officially recognised degrees in  Catalan, which allows it to undertake a quantitative analysis on  the basis of a strong statistical representation. To conclude, we  should stress that this definition of dropping out will be  established from an institutional perspective, i.e., without  considering the perspective of the student; in this way of thinking,  a student may drop out (not have achieved the aim of the  qualification) from the point of view of the university, but he or   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Therefore, from  an institutional point of view, the definition of dropping out will  always be harder or more negative than reality.   The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes  some approximations to the higher education dropping out  phenomenon in brick-and-mortar universities and, especially, in  distance learning institutions. Section 3 explains the data used and  the methodology followed for analyzing it. Section 4 presents the  main results and, finally, Section 5 deals with the conclusions and  future research in this topic.   2. PRIOR ANALYSIS OF UNIVERSITY  DROPPING OUT  Lassibille and Navarro [1] offer a recent view of the subject  through the Spanish brick-and-mortar university system. They  analysed 7,000 students enrolled at the University of Malaga  starting in September 1996 and running to June 2004 (8 academic  years). The authors ruled out analysis of students who took a  break during a certain academic year, as they only accounted for  2% of the total (in the case of students analysed at the UOC   online students  this figure is around 14.6%). The definition of  dropping out they give is very clear: a student is considered to  have dropped out of a particular degree course even if they move  to another one (we see later that this criterion is also used in the  analysis of UOC students).    On the basis of this definition, overall dropping out by this cohort  (i.e. the group of students who began at the start of 1996) during  the period under consideration is a high 46.1%. The authors work  immediately concentrates on analysing the causes of dropping out.  Other authors [2] put this figure at 40%-45% during the last 100  years.    In 2004, Berge and Huang [3] conducted a synthesis of the  bibliography available at the time on the problem of student drop- out rates in e-learning. They recorded the existence of a higher  level of dropping out in virtual environments than in brick-and- mortar environments, as can also be seen in Frankola [4];  although they did point out that the problem of dropping out is  complex and multidimensional. The authors established the  definition of a holistic model of university dropping out, which  concentrates its causes  and therefore the possible actions for  reducing this dropping out  on institutional factors (including  actions by lecturers and administrative personnel) and on the  socio-demographic and academic characteristics of the students.  This model provides a general framework that each institution  should adapt to its specific characteristics.   In their definition of the complementary term to dropping out  (which we could call continuity), Berge and Huang state that  the ultimate aim of continuity needs not always to be seen as the  qualification obtained through study (completion). For some  students, successful learning experiences have more to do with  participating and not with completing or obtaining a  degree, as stated in Kerka [5]. In this sense, Pappas and Loring  [6] give the name degree seekers to students, who, from an  institutional point of view, may be considered drop-outs when  they stop their studies.  However, we should remember that this  paper adopts a totally institutional perspective on dropping out,  which does not take into account, at least in this initial stage of  analysis, the aims of students. It is supposed, therefore, that all  students who enrol in a degree course intend to complete it and  obtain the accreditations.   2.1 Dropping out in distance higher education  It is interesting to note how the UNED, the main Spanish distance  university founded in 1972, analyzes the subject of dropping out  by its students. In an extensive article, Callejo [7] takes dropping  out analysis from a more long-term perspective than in a brick- and mortar university, in the same way as this article1. However,  in his definition of dropping out, he introduces a more qualitative  element, namely the intention to continue or not to continue by  students who are taking a break from their studies (which he asks  them about in a survey). Callejo negates that the congestion of  distance universities is one of the main causes of dropping out (it  can be seen that degree courses with large numbers of students   e.g. law and psychology  have proportionally lower rates of  dropping out than others with fewer students  such as  engineering). The author cites the intrinsic difficulty of the  contents of each programme as one of the main causes of  dropping out.   Lastly, it is interesting to see how a benchmark university in the  field of distance education on a world scale, the Open University  (UK), has analysed its drop-out rates. Tresman [8] stresses the  specificity of adult distance students and calls for an analysis that  matches this profile to be undertaken. He states that, the vast  majority who withdraw  94 per cent  still aspire to earn credit  for the course/award upon which they embarked. He  immediately collects their reasons for withdrawing from their  studies during the various stages in their academic lives and,  finally, proposes a strategy to improve student continuity.  Tresman starts the work that Ashby [9] would undertake two  years later, taking the Open University as a reference. The author  calls the classic definition of continuity the institutional  dimension, understood to be passing the course and presents  two new dimensions or definitions that relativise the importance  of the final qualification: that of the student and that of the  employer. The author gives the total drop-out rate (during the first  academic period) as 40% and says that, if this figure needs  comparing, it should be with other part-time educational  institutions and not with other traditional university education  (full-time brick-and-mortar) institutions.    3. DATA AND METHODOLOGY  The data used in this paper are taken from UOC academic  databases. For this initial study, only student enrolments are  analyzed. The following variables are available: IDP (Person  Identifier Code), unique to each student, it allows individual and  at the same time anonymous monitoring; gender; students date of  birth; semester of the students enrolment; codes of the subjects  enrolled in by the student; final grades obtained in the subjects;  number of credits that the subjects carry and, finally, the academic  programme, e.g. Law or Computer Engineering.  Specifically,  there is a record for each subject enrolled in the officially  recognised degrees in Catalan from the start of the university until  the end of the 2008-2009 academic year (in all, 1,169,262  records). Observe that enrolment at UOC is opened each semester,  which means bi-annually. A total of 19 degrees were offered  during this period. Only valid enrolments have been included, i.e.  ones that have been formalised and paid for, thus excluding  enrolments that were subsequently cancelled. A total enrolment  history was provided for 84,230 students, although only 62,450  (those of the 16 programmes with more available information)                                                                    1 Where taking a break during a single academic period is   considered dropping out.   76    were analysed. This study ignores the pilot cohorts of the  programmes that began at the start of the university, which limited  student access during the first semester to a closed number and,  for administration purposes; there was no access for new students  during the second semester.   To analyse the data described in this article, only the IDP,  semester of enrolment and academic programme fields were  considered. The information from these fields was used to  generate 20 files, 19 for each programme and a general file for all  programmes, each of which contains a record for each student.  These students are those who enrolled in one or more semesters of  the programme during the period in question. The records  generated have the following coding:   10104;1;1;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0   where the first number is the IDP and then a binary string for the  semester record (1 = student enrolled at least in one subject, 0  = student not enrolled in any subject). The specific nature of this  string is that, for analysis purposes, all enrolment sequences have  been put in the same starting position, that is, the first semester  when each IDP is enrolled in each degree is considered to be the  same for all students. Obviously, the first element after IDP is  always 1 (the first enrolment of each student). Finally, notice   that the sequences 113000;1;0;0;0;0;0;0 and 10104;1;0;0 are  different as more enrolment history about the first student is  available for analysis (specifically, 7 semesters as opposed to 3).   Once the enrolment sequences file of each programme is  generated, the frequency of break sequences (that is, of sequences  of one or more 0) can then be analysed. This is performed via a  process that detects the longest break sequence (with 1;0;...;0;1  format) within each enrolment sequence of each individual, with  the particularity that if, for example, a student has taken a break  once over 5 semesters and over 2 during another semester, he or  she will only be calculated as having taken a break over 5  semesters. Notice that this process does not take graduates into  consideration, as they may be considered as taking a break or  abandoning their studies, when they have in fact obtained their  degree. Transfer to other programmes is also ignored, because the  analysis of success or failure is taken from a specific  programme perspective. Additionally, transfer values in UOC are  very small. For exemplification purposes, Table 1 shows the  probability of having a break of N semesters for the Law degree  (with 7,938 students and a history of 24 semesters) and the Market  Research and Techniques (MR&T) degree (with 1,718 students  and a history of 14 semesters).

Columns  5-7 reproduce the same for the MR&T degree. In the light of these  results, there are two students in the Law degree that take a break  of 19 consecutive semesters, which may be surprising but shows  the wide diversity of online students' interests and behaviour.   77    Nevertheless, in order to define dropping out, we are interested in  establishing a threshold for what we consider a reasonable period  of break time. As shown in bold in Table 1, only 3.77% of Law  students take a break of 5 or more semesters. In the case of  MR&T students, a similar percentage (3.14%) is found but only  with 3 semesters or more, showing a relevant difference among  academic programmes. In short, if we define dropping out as  taking a break of 5 or more semesters for the Law degree, we are  assuming an error smaller than 5%, which can be considered  reasonable. On the contrary, dropping out is defined in the MR&T  degree as having a break of only 3 semesters with the same error  assumption. Notice that the fact that a Law student has the  1;0;0;0;0 string in his or her enrolment sequence is not  sufficient information to see whether he or she will drop out, as  we need an additional semester as mentioned above. Following  this criterion we are able to label each student with a sequence of  N or more 0 as dropping out.  Therefore, a definition of the drop-out rate for a specific  programme would be reached inductively as being the proportion  of students who have taken a break for N or more semesters out of  the total number of students enrolled in the programme during the  period in question. N is determined using the maximum  probability of the 5% error rate in classifying the student as a  drop-out once they have taken a break of N or more semesters in  that specific programme; in other words, a maximum of 5% of  students on that specific programme return to their studies after  taking a break of N or more consecutive semesters, so the  maximum error is upper-bounded.   4. RESULTS  On the basis of the work set out in the section above, the  definition of dropping out for each programme of officially  recognised degrees in Catalan is reached. The specificity of the  programme in question is highly relevant. Although, logically, the  definition of dropping out in qualitative terms is the same for all  courses; repetition of the probability analysis carried out for all  programmes gives as the result different quantitative definitions  depending on the values of the parameter of this definition, i.e.  different N values for consecutive break semesters.   4.1 Differences among programmes  Table 2 provides a summary of the values associated with the  graphs of the 16 programmes analysed (the three more recent  programmes have not been included because more historical  information was needed). The explanation of the fields of Table 2  is as follows. For each programme, the minimum number of  consecutive break semesters needed to be considered dropping out  is N, with the maximum error that is smaller than 5%, as well as  the number of semesters defined in the curriculum of each  programme2 , the number of semesters since the programme  began and the number of students with at least N+1 semesters.  Finally, the last two columns make reference to the percentage of  students achieving the degree or dropping out, respectively.  As shown in Table 2, the number of semesters that define  dropping out in each programme has particularly relevant  variability: this value varies between 3 and 5 semesters. Notice  that these figures are very conservative, since using an upper                                                                     2 Normally, the real duration is longer, as students enrol in fewer   subjects than those theoretically defined in the curriculum,  especially in distance universities.   bound of 10% would have reduced the number of consecutive  break semesters.  An initial analysis of these results shows that there appears to be  no relationship between the type of programme content, i.e.  technical or humanistic, and the number of semesters that  determines dropping out. For example, in the case of Computer  Engineering, the value is high (5 semesters), but it is the same in  the case of Humanities. On the other hand, it does seem that in  programmes where students have prior higher education  experience related to the curriculum they are studying (in Spain  they are known as Second cycle degrees, the ones with a  duration of 4 semesters at the bottom of Table 2), dropping out is  decided with fewer semesters than on programmes where this  experience is not required (known as First cycle or First and  Second cycle). This way, the average number of semesters that  define dropping out of all the students who have dropped out from  second cycle programmes is 3.69 semesters, while it is 4.61 in  students of the other programmes. To validate this statement  statistically, an independent-samples T-test3  is carried out with  SPSS package. Since the significance value of the test is less than  0.05, it can be safely concluded that the difference of 0.92 is not  due to chance alone. It can also be seen that students in shorter  duration programmes (second cycle) also take shorter breaks  during their academic record, which seems logical.   4.2 Enroment behaviour graphs  Armed with these parameters, specifically the name of the  programme and the minimum number of consecutive break  semesters needed to consider dropping out (N), graphs for each  programme, as well as a general graph, can be drawn up to  visually display the behaviour of enrolment, dropping out and  accreditations of each programme. Figure 1 shows an example of  the calculated graphs, in particular for the Law programme. For  simplification purposes, only arcs with a minimum proportion of  students (1%) are shown. The graph shows in some way the  survival history of students of each programme. For example, in  the first node of the graph shown, 6,149 students of Law (who  enrolled at least 5+1 semesters ago) appear in the starting position  (at the first semester). This number is greatly reduced in the  second semester, in which only 4,048 students (65.83%) continue  from the original 6,149.  Noticeably, the main cause of this loss of  2,101 students is dropping out after the first semester (1,643  students). That is, one out of four students does not continue after  the first semester.                                                                      3 Equal variances not assumed.   78    Table 2: Results summary by programme and total of programmes   Programme N Error Duration Available data Number of   students Accredited  Dropping   out  Business Sci. 5 3,78% 6 26 16818 16.6% 54.3%  Tech.

CONCLUSIONS  This paper deals with the formulation of a definition of dropping  out that is suitable for the students of a distance higher education  institution such as is the UOC. This objective is quite important if  it is considered that most UOC students are adult students with  work and family commitments additional to that of continuing  education and, therefore, with a natural tendency to take academic  breaks. On the other hand, this objective is somewhat difficult to  reach, due to the fact that these break periods could be interpreted  as only that (periods of rest) or, at some point, as indicators of  having definitely dropped out of their studies.   At the end of the analysis carried out in this work, it seems that  the effort invested in reaching an inductive definition of dropping  out, achieved using the enrolment and non-enrolment (break)  behaviour of students in each programme or academic discipline,  has led to particularly relevant results. This definition is highly  sensitive to the reality of each programme. Consequently, it has  enabled us to classify students as drop-outs when they take a  break of just 3 consecutive semesters, for example in the case of  Psychology or Tourism, and up to as long a period as 5 semesters,  i.e. two years and a half, in the case, for instance, of Business  Sciences or Humanities.   The definition was sustained in an analysis of the Universitat  Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) enrolment data, running from 1996- 1997 to the 2008-2009 academic years for official degrees in  Catalan, with at least 14 semesters of record. This includes 16  different programmes. In particular, an analysis in terms of  programmes was carried out, concerning the frequency of break  sequences, that is, the consecutive periods of non-enrolment that  culminate in a reincorporation of students into the same degree.  The result of this analysis is the minimum break sequence (of N or  more semesters) that has a very low associated probability of  students returning (fewer than 5%, the assumed error). N, the  number of consecutive semesters in blank, enables a student to be  classified as a drop-out for a specific programme. We should  stress, however, that this N value is different for each programme,  and that herein lies the potential for the definition of dropping out  that has been reached in this paper. Therefore, a single definition  for dropping out cannot be established at the university level.   In an initial approach to the analysis of differences between  programmes in terms of the number of semesters that trigger  dropping out, it appears that in programmes where students have  prior higher education experience, the decision to drop out is  made more quickly (almost one semester before) than in  programmes where such experience is not required. This may be  due to students having clearer objectives in these types of  programmes, which are based on completed studies (in a previous  degree). It could also be related to the shorter theoretical duration  of such degrees. We should also point out that total (accumulated)  dropping out percentages for these kinds of programmes are  significantly smaller than those for the other programmes.   The analysis conducted in this paper, which allows us to establish  whether a student can be considered a drop-out or not, is the  starting point towards undertaking a close study of the  characteristics of students who drop out. Such a study will be  based on data already collected, but not yet incorporated into the  analysis, such as age and sex of the students or other variables  related to number and kinds of subjects taken every semester. We  should also consider the addition of new variables which are the  result of a more qualitative analysis than the one undertaken in   this paper. Possibly the real dropout, the one that is related to the  learning process, takes place a lot earlier than when a student can  be tagged as dropout from an institution point of view (that is,  after N consecutive semesters of break). Once the causes of  dropping out have been detected, the establishing of corrective  actions that have a positive effect on reducing dropping out should  report benefits both at institutional and personal levels, especially  for those students who have given up the fight with a sense of not  having achieved their learning objectives.   6.
