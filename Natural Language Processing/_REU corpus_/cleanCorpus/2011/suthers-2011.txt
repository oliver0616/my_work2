A Unified Framework for Multi-Level Analysis of  Distributed Learning   Daniel Suthers  Dept. of Information and Computer Sciences   University of Hawaii,  1680 East-West Road, POST 309   Honolulu, HI 96822, USA   suthers@hawaii.edu  Devan Rosen  School of Communications   Ithaca College  953 Danby Road,   Ithaca, NY 14850, USA  drosen@ithaca.edu  ABSTRACT  Learning and knowledge creation is often distributed across  multiple media and sites in networked environments. Traces of  such activity may be fragmented across multiple logs and may not  match analytic needs. As a result, the coherence of distributed  interaction and emergent phenomena are analytically cloaked.  Understanding distributed learning and knowledge creation  requires multi-level analysis of the situated accomplishments of  individuals and small groups and of how this local activity gives  rise to larger phenomena in a network. We have developed an  abstract transcript representation that provides a unified analytic  artifact of distributed activity, and an analytic hierarchy that  supports multiple levels of analysis. Log files are abstracted to  directed graphs that record observed relationships (contingencies)  between events, which may be interpreted as evidence of  interaction and other influences between actors. Contingency  graphs are further abstracted to two-mode directed graphs that  record how associations between actors are mediated by digital  artifacts and summarize sequential patterns of interaction.  Transitive closure of these associograms creates sociograms, to  which existing network analytic techniques may be applied,  yielding aggregate results that can then be interpreted by reference  to the other levels of analysis. We discuss how the analytic  hierarchy bridges between levels of analysis and theory.

INTRODUCTION The rapid adoption of information and communication  technologies (ICT) in support of online, distributed, and   networked learning and knowledge creation activities [1], and  their blending with face-to-face venues [17] is well known to the  research community to which this paper is addressed. In this paper  we use learning as shorthand to include any enhancements of  individual or collective knowledge or skills, whether or not it  occurs in formal educational settings. We include in our scope of  interest learning in (for example) online university settings,  professional communities, and virtual organizations [2, 4, 9, 35].  We will refer to these collectively as socio-technical networks  [24]. A related trend is towards open learning communities.  Courses in formal educational settings need no longer isolate  participants from others in different courses, but can embed  courses in online communities of learners, for example supporting  transdisciplinary graduate education [12]. In corporate or other  work settings, professional learning communities similarly may  cross team contexts rather than being isolated in work teams [50].  The fundamental question of interest in all of these settings is how  learning takes place through the interplay between individual and  collective agency. All learning activity requires that individuals  take actions, but these individual actions are contingent on the  actions of others in their socio-technical network contexts, actions  that reflexively construct those contexts.    The first analytic challenge addressed by this paper is that  learning and knowledge creation activities in these networked  environments are often distributed across multiple media and  sites. As a result, traces of such activity may be fragmented across  multiple logs. For example, the networked learning environments  we study offer mixtures of threaded discussion, synchronous  chats, wikis, whiteboards, profiles, and resource sharing. Events  in these media may be logged in different formats and recorded in  databases and text files, disassociating actions that for participants  were part of a single unified activity. This disassociation is  exacerbated when activity is distributed across multiple virtual  sites or spread over time. Also, the granularity at which events are  recorded may not match analytic needs, and media-level events  may be the wrong ontology for analyses that begin with  relationships rather than individual acts. Translation from log file  representations to other levels of description may be required to  begin the primary analysis. As a result of these various issues, the  coherence of distributed interaction and phenomena that emerge  from this interaction are analytically cloaked.      Furthermore, understanding distributed learning and knowledge  creation requires multi-level analysis of the situated  accomplishments of individuals and small groups and of how  these local accomplishments give rise to larger phenomena in  networks such as the dissemination and transformation of ideas,  implicit coordination of the activities of many participants, and  the accrual of collective knowledge.

Everything builds on the existence of multiple  successive moments in which an individual is experiencing some  presentation of the virtual environment, cares enough to act, and is  able to choose an appropriate action. Whether and how this action  has implications for network or community level phenomena  requires that some trace of the action be given persistent form that  other participants might later encounter in their experience of the  virtual environment [22]. Appropriate aggregation and availability  of such traces can drive dissemination of ideas, align participants,  and lead to accrual of collective resources of value. Critically, an  empirically grounded understanding of this emergence requires  analysis at both fine-grained and aggregate levels. The same can  be said for understanding the relationship between small group  interactions and larger scale phenomena.    In summary, since interaction is distributed across space, time,  and media, and the data comes in a variety of formats, there is no  single transcript to inspect and share, and the available data  representations may not make interaction and its consequences  apparent. To address these concerns (and to support the diverse  research in our laboratory), we have developed a framework  consisting of an abstract transcript representation that collects  relevant events into a single analytic artifact, and an analytic  hierarchy that supports multiple levels of analysis. This paper  describes the framework and discusses its potential roles in  unifying multiple sources of data and bridging between levels of  analysis and theory. We discuss how the framework addresses  several specific analytic needs, including: (a) scaling up  microanalysis of interaction to large data sets, (b) enabling the  translation of event logs into tie data appropriate for social  network analysis, and (c) interpreting results at one level in terms  of another (e.g., relating social network analytic results back to  their interactional settings). Throughout the paper, a simple  example drawn from our prior research illustrates many of the  features of the framework.    2. PREVIEW  The analytic hierarchy consists of several abstraction layers of  analytic representations that we have found to be useful,  summarized in Table 1. Process traces such as log files are  abstracted to domain models describing the actors, actions and  media objects involved in event models, which are collections of   temporally tagged events. These event models can be further  elaborated by installing directed graphs of empirical relationships  between events called contingencies. Contingencies can be any  observed relationship between events (e.g., two events are by the  same actor, involve the same object, are temporally contiguous or  proximal, or overlap in content). Contingencies situate  participants acts in relation to other eventshence the name  contextualized action model. The analytic utility of contingency  graphs is enhanced if focused on those contingencies that may be  interpreted as evidence of uptake: interaction and other influences  between actors. When such interpretations are made, contingency  graphs are abstracted into uptake graphs, representing generalized  interaction models. Interaction can be further abstracted to two- mode directed graphs, called associograms, which record how  associations between actors are mediated by their creation and  modification of and access to digital artifacts: hence the name  mediation models. Associograms also summarize sequential  patterns of interaction, making it easier to localize certain  patterns. Reduction of associograms by transitive closure into  direct ties between actors yields sociograms, representing tie  models. Existing network analytic techniques may be applied to  sociograms. The results of network analysis can then be  interpreted by reference to the other levels of analysis. Thus  associograms bridge between interaction analysis and network  analysis.   The analytic concepts (e.g., contingencies, uptake, mediated  associations, and ties) in this paper are not new. The value of the  framework relies on the fact that they are abstractions of concepts  commonly applied in existing analytic practice (e.g., adjacency,  edits, replies, etc.) as will be detailed later. Thus the framework is  offered to coordinate and augment rather than replace existing  analytic practices.    The layers are explained in more detail in the following  subsections. The process trace, domain, and event models and  transformations between them are likely to be familiar to readers:  brief sections on these layers are included for completeness and to  provide the foundation and examples for describing subsequent  layers. Contingency and uptake graphs and associograms are more  unique contributions, so are described in some detail heresee  also [45] for extensive discussion of motivations for contingency  graphs and examples of their use for uptake analysis. The most  abstract layer is covered substantially in the social network  analysis literature [e.g., 49], so is described here only in relation  to how it is derived from the layer below, and what that vertical  relationship enables that would not be possible with direct  measurement of ties. Throughout this presentation, applications to  the study of learning analytics are discussed. The methods  described in this paper have been applied in numerous analyses of  data from an online learning environment and from laboratory  studies of ICT mediated collaboration. At present we are using  these techniques in analyses of SRIs Tapped-In teacher  professional community [15, 39], a virtual organization that hosts  many thousands of education professionals annually in more than  800 user-created spaces that include IRC, threaded discussions,  shared files and URLs, and other tools to support collaborative  work.    3. PROCESS TRACES  Any analysis of interaction begins with a process trace, or record  of activity left in the environment and accessible to the researcher.  Examples include software log data (software application or  server logs), audio and video recordings, and textual transcripts.   Table 1.

For learning  analytic applications and to emphasize the potential for automated  analysis, this paper focuses on software logs, and does not touch  on issues of video analysis; see [18, 21] for discussion of such  issues.    The analytic hierarchy is illustrated throughout this paper by  building on a simplified example taken from one of our online  learning community applications, disCourse. The disCourse  environment provides threaded discussions, wiki pages, resource  sharing with searchable metadata, and user profiles, organized in a  workspace metaphor that collects together tools and resources  relevant to a given group, such as a class [43]. The lower portion  of Figure 1 shows excerpts (edited for anonymity and simplicity  of presentation) of an http server log1 from disCourse. The  example in this paper builds on these logs. See [45] for the full  text of the example.   4. ENTITY-RELATIONS: DOMAIN  MODEL  Prior to or concurrently with the construction of the event model  (next section), it is necessary to construct an ontology of the kinds  of entities involved in the application domain of interest. Classes  of entities and potential structural relationships between them are  defined (e.g., actors, discussions, and messages, related by  containment, threading and authoring relations). As the trace or  log file is processed, new instances of entities and their structural  relations are added to the domain model when they are  encountered, along with relevant attributes that are expected to be                                                                     1 disCourse logs events in a database. HTTP server logs of the same   events are shown in this example to illustrate the method using log  formats familiar to readers.  needed for analysis. This is undertaken in conjunction with  construction of the event model. For example, the right hand side  of Figure 1 illustrates a domain model fragment representing how  messages m1, ... m4 are created by participants P1, P2, P3 (shown by shading), related to each other by a threading relation,  and contained in a discussion forum. The content of messages are  also recorded in the domain model. Temporal information is  recorded in the event model, discussed next.   5. EVENTS: EVENT MODEL The process trace is transformed into a set of events that constitute  an analysts first commitments concerning the relevant units for  analyzing processes. This transformation involves the Exploratory  Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) operations of chunking and  coding [37]. For example, the first three lines of the log of Figure  1 all are part of the process of posting a message in a system in  which each message is previewed before posting. These three  traces are chunked together and represented as the single event w1 in the event model, along with information about the actor (P2, indicated by grey), action taken (w for writing), object (message  m1), contents and location (recorded in the domain model), and  temporal scope of the action.  We call this layer the event model because the focus is on individual actions and other events by  nonhuman actants such as software display events. (Actant is  Latours [27] term for non-human entities that yet have agency in  networks of associations.) The events have not yet been put in  relation to each other, other than ordering along a timeline.    Events may be derived from distinct process traces that come  from different media, tools or sites, and are recorded in different  formats. For example, chat contributions, wiki edits, whiteboard  edits, file uploads, etc. can be merged into a single event stream.  (To remain faithful to the case example and avoid complicating  the figures, this capability is not illustrated in the figures, but it is  a simple extension.) A key concern is persistence of identity  across tools and sites: some work may be required to ensure that  each given actor is represented by the same identifier in the event   Figure 1. From process trace to domain and event models   66    model, and likewise for the identity of digital objects shared  across tools (ideally persistence of identity should be addressed in  mash-ups for the learners sake [25]). Once this has been  accomplished, the event and domain models taken together  provide an abstract transcript of the data that re-assembles in one  analytic artifact the diverse events that were for their actors a  single activity. If the transcription is complete with respect to the  needs of a given analysis, then it is not necessary to retain the  original process traces. However, we retain pointers to the original  process traces because it may not be possible to identify all needs  in advance, and because (in the case of video and audio) some  aspects of the data recording cannot be abstracted into computer  representations. We may need to recover other information from  the process trace. Also, any transcript includes initial theoretical  commitments [13, 34], which may turn out to be faulty,  necessitating a return to the original process traces.    A number of analyses can be undertaken on the event and domain  models without further analysis. In our research, this is the level at  which we answer basic questions about the distribution of activity  in the environment: who is participating with whom, in what  virtual sites or contexts, and involving what literal content. But to  analyze interaction and uncover ties between actors we must  relate events to each other.    6. CONTINGENCY GRAPH:  CONTEXTUAL ACTION MODEL   Contingency graphs are an empirically grounded elaboration of  the abstract transcript to make analytically relevant relationships  between events explicit. We originally called these relationships  dependencies, but have renamed them contingencies because they  capture relationships between events that may be merely  contingent or incidental to the situation, rather than being causal  or deterministic. The graph simply makes relationships that are  latent in the data more explicit, and does not constitute a  commitment concerning actors intentions. Human action can be  embedded in its context in many ways, including accidental  relationships, or opportunistic leveraging of contextual and  historical features as well as necessary antecedents for action [6,  27]. Thus, a contingency graph represents how action is  embedded in the context of other events. Examples of contingency  types we have used are listed in Table 1 not intended to be a  complete taxonomy). A detailed presentation of the motivations  and theory behind contingency graphs and their application to  interaction analysis may be found in [45].    Construction of a complete graph of the contingencies between  events in a process trace is not practical, as it would result in a  graph with a high signal to noise ratio that is too complex for  processing. (Imagine a graph in which each event is linked to  every other event involving the same actor, or the same object, or  that has overlap in lexical content, or occurred nearby in time, and  so on.) An analyst chooses those contingencies that are relevant  for specific analytic purposes as guided by explicit or implicit  theory. Therefore a contingency graph reflects further  commitments on the part of the analyst. However, even though a  contingency graph is theoretically selective, we always base  contingencies on empirically observable relationships between  events found in the event and domain models, preferably those  relationships that are unambiguous and can be detected  automatically. If this standard of evidence is followed, a  contingency graph can be treated as an abstract transcript that   makes the evidence for interaction or other phenomena of interest  manifest.   Contingency graphs can be constructed automatically from the  layers below it [see, for example, 32]. For example, for each event  in which an actor accessed an object we might scan back to find  the last event in which the object's contents were modified, and  install a media dependency. Contingencies can also be installed  from a given event to the most recent prior event involving the  actor, to prior events in which the actor accessed a media object  with similar inscriptions (e.g., lexical phrases or graphical  devices), or to temporally recent events in the same spatial site. A  challenge with algorithmic installation of contingencies is limiting  their number. Temporal or sequential proximity are useful (and  computable) heuristics for selecting relevant contingent events, as  they follow the local continuity of human attention and goal  directed behavior: what actors do at any given moment is likely to  be contingent upon their immediately prior act. We are using  temporal proximity in our analysis of quasi-synchronous chats in  Tapped In [44].   For example, Figure 2 shows the events of Figure 1 with  contingencies installed. The single arcs represent media  dependencies, and the double arcs represent multiple  contingencies, such as temporal proximity combined with same  actor and possibly inscriptional similarity. The act of reading a  message (r1, r2, etc.) is media-dependent on the act of creating  the message (w1, w2, etc.). The act of writing a message (e.g.,  w2) may be media-dependent on the act of creating the message  to which it is a threaded reply (e.g., w1) and is contingent on the  messages that the author has recently read (e.g., r1).  In this  example, the message created by w2 contained a noun-phrase in  common with that created by w1.  Once constructed, various kinds of analytic actions are possible on  contingency graphs. For example, suppose a particularly  productive session was identified in which participants made  significant ideational progress. One option is to examine the  interaction of the session participants more closely to identify the   Table 2. Examples of contingency types   E2 is contingent on E1 when  Media  Dependency    E2 operates on a media object or state of that  object that was created or modified by E1 (e.g., reply to a message; editing a shared  wiki).  Same Actor E2 and E1 were due to acts of the same actor.  Actor Address E2 adresses the actor of E1 by name.  Addressed Actor  E2 is generated by an actor addressed by name  in E1. (Whether or not E2 is intended as a  reply is left for interpretation.)    Inscriptional  Similarity   E2 creates inscriptions with visual attributes  similar to those of inscriptions created by E1. E2 creates inscriptions with lexical strings  identical to those in inscriptions created by  E1.  Temporal Proximity   E2 took place soon after E1, where soon  depends on the attentional properties of the  agents and persistency of the medium (e.g.,  proximal messages in chat).   Spatial  Organization   E2 operates on inscriptions in a spatial context  created by E1 (e.g., grouping a graphical  object by placing it near others).   67    relationship between group processes and their accomplishments,  and how participants appropriated the interactional affordances of  the available media for these purposes. We have used the  contingency graphs in several studies to support this kind of  microanalysis of interaction [30, 31, 32, 46]. Recurring patterns of  interaction so identified could be searched for in the overall  contingency graph to find other sessions that have similar patterns  of activity, to see whether they display similar productivity. Such  pattern matching techniques are similar to structural equivalence  metrics in social network analysis, which can be employed once  contingency graphs are converted into sociograms, as discussed in  section 9. Another option is to look outside the session to find  influences from or to other sessions. One can trace same-actor and  media-dependency contingencies, following the actors and actants  respectively. Tracing proceeds forward in time to see whether the  new ideas of the session were disseminated elsewhere, or  backward in time to identify possible predecessors of the  ideational advance. Such an analysis grounds the concept of  brokers in actual accomplishments, not relying solely on  structural relationships that do not guarantee such  accomplishments. At this writing we are constructing a  contingency graph of several years of data from Tapped-In in  preparation for application of methods such as those just  described.    7. UPTAKE GRAPH: GENERALIZED  INTERACTION MODEL  As discussed above, contingencies are so named because they can  include circumstantial relationships between acts with varying  degrees of relevance to interaction and other associations between  actors. Analytic interpretation is required to identify relationships  between events that are not merely circumstantial, but reflect  intentional acts. An act of uptake is one in which an actor takes   traces of one or more prior events as having certain significance  for an ongoing activity [45]. For example, a speaker takes up  some aspect of the prior speakers utterance, or a message poster  in a discussion forum can take up some aspect of the message  being replied to. Uptake is a generalization of all interactional  relationships used in analysis, such as comment, reply, elaboration. It includes these relationships, but also applies to  spatio-temporally distributed associations between actors in which  they may not even be aware of each other, let alone be directing  their actions towards each other, such as tagging, downloading,  etc. Uptake is more general than transactivity [5], which requires  other-directedness. Uptake is an appropriate unit of association  (generalizing interaction) in networked learning environments,  where individuals may benefit from each others presence without  conversing directly [10, 19]. The essential idea is that the trace an  actor's actions have left in the environment (e.g., chat  contribution, discussion posting, uploaded file, profile,  recommendation) is taken up by another actor in some manner.  Uptake of traces can result in stigmergic effects, i.e., implicit  distributed coordination of collective action [14, 36]. Illuminating  these stigmergic effects reveals the contingencies by which an  individuals actions are connected to information, actions, and  resources from sources that may otherwise not be known to that  individual, even if embedded within ones known social network.   An uptake graph is a generalized interaction model, as it describes  the interaction and other associations that the analysis claims is  taking place. Although all analytic artifacts from process traces on  up involve theoretical decisions, the move from contingency  graphs to uptake graphs is a move from primarily empirically  accountable representations to those more strongly determined by  analytic interpretations. Representationally, an uptake relation is a  subgraph of contingencies, as illustrated in Figure 3.  An analyst  collects contingencies that are considered to be analytically  meaningful: a number of contingencies between two or more acts   Figure 2.  Installing contingencies Figure 3. From contingency to uptake graphs  68    may corroborate the interpretation that the final act is an  intentional taking up of traces of the prior ones. For example, w2, in which P1 posts a reply to the message posted by P2 in w1, is  contingent on w1 in these ways: there is a media dependency (m2 is linked by threading to m1); lexical overlap (m2 contains  phrases also found in m1); and a chain of temporal proximity (w2 took place shortly after read event r1 by the same actor, and r1 is  media-dependent on w1 by virtue of reading m1). All of these  contingencies are taken as evidence for an intentional relationship  of w2 to w1, and collapsed into one uptake arc. Because of this  relationship between contingencies and uptake, an uptake graph  may be seen as an abstraction of a contingency graph, and many  of the same analytic moves (such as pattern matching and tracing  actions) apply to both.    Contingency and uptake graphs are described more fully in [45].  We have used contingency and uptake graphs to provide  interactional accounts of specific accomplishments of participants  [30, 31], to trace out information sharing [48], and to detect roles  of participants not visible in the final media trace [46]. For  example, examining only reply structure (the threading  relationship between messages in Figure 1) we might miss the fact  that m4 played an integrative role in this discussion. The uptake  graph of Figure 3 makes this integration explicit as a structure of  uptake converging on w4. (which is not taking up the message to  which it is linked by threaded reply). Integrative or convergent  acts are important to group learning processes such as  intersubjective meaning making [42] and community knowledge  building [38].    Contingency and uptake graphs represent process models: they  focus on how acts relate to each other and constitute a process of  interaction. Their basic unit is acts and other events: the actors and  entities through which interaction takes place are attributes of  these events. Now we turn to an alternative derived representation  that makes these actors and entities explicit, rather than the events.     8. ASSOCIOGRAMS: MEDIATION  MODEL  In the study of socio-technical networks, we are interested in how  the technological infrastructure enables and is utilized by the  social actors to interact with each other. The next layer of the  analytic hierarchy makes the objects of this technological  infrastructure explicit and shows how they mediate interaction  between participants. Analysis at this layer provides the mediation  model, and is represented by multi-modal bipartite graphs in  which participants are related to each other via the objects through  which they interact. We call these graphs associograms to  distinguish them from sociograms in a manner that honors  Latour's [27] concept of mediated associations that assemble a  social system. Associograms are multimodal because there may  be two or more types of nodesactors and the various types of  media through which they interactand they are bipartite because  they are divided into two partitions: actors in one partition and the  various types of media objects in the other. Directed arcs  represent state-influence (a weaker form of state-dependency):  they extend from an object to an actor if the state of the object is  influenced by some action of the actor (e.g., writing a message or  editing a wiki), and from the actor to the object if the state of the  actor has been influenced by accessing the object (e.g., reading a  message or wiki)    One can construct associograms from a set of events, whether  taken directly from the event model, or events of interest that were   selected from the contextualized action or interaction models   (contingency graphs or uptake graphs, respectively). A node in  any of these models represents an event, and actors and objects  are attributes of the node. This is largely reversed in an  associogram: actors and objects are nodes, and events are links  between nodes. For example, in Figure 4, w1the event of P2 writing m1becomes a directed association from m1 to P2 (m1s state is influenced by P1), and r1the event of P1 reading  m1becomes a directed association from P1 to m1.  An associogram can be constructed at different granularities.  Object nodes could be created for each individual object (e.g., one  node for each message, wiki page, chat, etc., as in Figure 4), or  they could be aggregated for object types (e.g., all associations via  messages aggregated into a single node, those via wikis in  another, etc.) in order to characterize how interaction is  distributed across types of media [7]. Some information is lost in  either case: all the events involving an actor and an object will fall  into the same two nodes and links between them. For example, if  P1 reads m1 multiple times there is still only one link from P1 to  m1, and if P2 edits a wiki multiple times, there is still one link  from the wiki to P2. Some of this information can be preserved  by weighting the links with number of occurrences, or by putting  backpointers to the originating event nodes. Temporal sequencing  is mostly lost, though it can be recovered by following these  backpointers to the contingency graph. This information reduction  is actually an advantage of associograms: they reduce the clutter  of interaction models to expose recurring patterns of mediation.  An example is given next.   8.1 Finding Interaction Patterns Associograms can help expose patterns of interest in contingency  or uptake graphs. For example, consider the question of finding   Figure 4. From events to associations  69    which participants are in dialogue with each other. Dialogue is  clearly a prerequisite for learning through argumentation [3],  intersubjective meaning-making [42] and group cognition [40]. A  key indicator of the presence of dialogue is what we call a round  trip: one participant makes a contribution that is accessed by  another participant who then makes a contingent contribution  (evidencing uptake) that the first participant then accesses [48]. In  a contingency graph one would need to trace out many paths from  each participant to find paths that go to another participant via a  read and then a write and then back to the first participant. In an  associogram one need only find cycles in the graph. If the links  are weighted with frequency counts, the minimum weight of the  path is taken as a measure of extent of dialogue. For example, in  Figure 4 there is a cycle  (following the arrows in reverse to trace  chronology rather than dependency) P2m1P1m2P2. This corresponds to the round trip in which P2 posts m1, P1 reads it and posts m2 in reply and P2 reads m2, completing the  round trip. Note that P2 need not post a reply to m2 to complete  the round trip: an analysis that looks only at the threading  structure of posted messages and does not include read events  would miss this round trip.    8.2 Characterizing Mediation Degree and path analysis of an associogram can reveal the roles  different media play in a socio-technical network. Media objects  or media types (in an aggregate associogram) that have high in- degree are accessed by many actors, and hence may be influential  sites where an educational intervention can reach many  participants in a socio-technical network. Those with high out- degree are modified by many actors, and hence may be sites  where ideas are aggregated or consolidated (potential roles as  community memory, or locus of knowledge building). In a  weighted associogram, heavily weighted links indicate that actors  visit the incident objects repeatedly. These measures may be  compared between different media types to assess their relative  roles. Additional roles can be identified, such as liaison roles,  where the media object or type connects other objects or actors  that would not otherwise be reachable. For example, we have used  associograms constructed from bridging events to assess the roles  of different media (discussions, wikis, resources and profiles) in  mediating bridging and supporting communities in socio-technical  networks [7, 43].    8.3 Characterizing Mediated Relationships  Associograms summarize how the afilliations between any given  two people [28] are reflected in media associations. The subgraph   of all paths of length two (direct mediation) between two persons  can be used in at least two ways to characterize the relationships  between those persons as mediated by the socio-technical system.  First, we can recognize defined patterns [23], four of which are  shown in Figure 5. Second, profiles of mediated interaction  between any two people can be represented as vectors of the  weights on paths of different types and directions (e.g., P1 to P2 via discussions, P2 to P1 via discussions, P1 to P2 via wikis,  etc.). Cluster analysis of these vectors can reveal recurring  patterns. These approaches are currently being investigated in a  dissertation by Kar-Hai Chu, under the authors direction.    9. SOCIOGRAMS: TIE MODEL Finally, we briefly note that associograms can be transformed to  conventional sociograms by transitive closure of the paths  between actors, or by other computations that interpret patterns of  mediated associations as ties. As shown in Figure 6, this results in  a directed graph or an asymmetric matrix representing the ties  between actors. Well established methods of social network  analysis (SNA) can then be applied [49], but with advantages that  would not be realized if one had merely constructed sociograms  directly from source data (e.g., surveys about ties). A tie in a  sociogram or sociomatrix is really shorthand for a complex  network of multi-mediated interactions that develop over time. If  suitable back-pointers to prior representations (the associograms  and, via them, the contingency graph) are maintained, then results  obtained via network analysis of ties can then be interpreted and  understood by expanding back to the mediation and interaction  models underlying those ties.    In fact, bidirectional construction and deconstruction of ties was  one motivation for the development of this analytic hierarchy. We  wanted to leverage the power of SNA for describing patterns of  relationships between actors in terms of the structural positions  they occupy in relational networks, but wanted to retain the  complex and artifact-mediated interactions that ties summarize. In  classic SNA research, ties are identified through manual  techniques such as interviews or questionnaires, eliciting Figure 5. Pairwise associations  Figure 6. From associogram to sociogram  70    subjective perceptions of relatedness to others. Some computer- mediated environments allow for a more automated data  collection, such as email networks, but those generally represent  explicit, intentional communication. Online environments,  through activity logging, offer the potential of automatically  computing ties from traces of behavior, but they log actions rather  than relationships. Therefore, methods to convert activity and  interaction into ties are of value. These traces may not reflect  subjective perceptions of relationships between persons, but have  the advantage that this conversion can be automated. The analytic  hierarchy supports such an automated translation from activity  logs to mediated interaction and ultimately ties to which SNA  methods can be applied. But the value of the analytic hierarchy  does not only lie in automating the gathering of tie data for SNA.  Analysis and interpretation can go in the other way as well. Once  analytic results are reached using summary representations of  tiesor using bipartite representations of artifact-mediated  relationshipsthese results can be interpreted by unpacking the  binary ties back into the interactional sequence that they  summarize.    Part of the unique power of social network analysis is in the  ability to identify systemic organization, providing a window into  social systems that is otherwise difficult to gain. Taking a  systemic approach to learning frames the learning process as a  group of individuals that, when interacting with each other via the  artifacts of the environment, create a whole greater than any  isolated individual [11]. If we are to analytically study learning  processes it is helpful to have frameworks for analysis that can  trace the patterns of interaction generated from learning processes,  and harness the information available from the structure revealed  by those patterns. The framework presented above provides a  missing piece in the analytic ability to extract structural indicators  (traces) of activity, both intentionally (e.g. discussion board  posts), and unintentionally cast off (e.g. accessing a digital  artifact), from individuals interacting and learning in mediated  environments   10. DISCUSSION  10.1 Status The framework discussed in this paper has been used extensively  in our research through mixtures of manual and ad-hoc automated  analysis, leading to implementation of a principled analytic  software toolkit. Research in our own laboratory is diverse: we  study technology-mediated interaction ranging from dyads to  online communities, and our methods draw on experimental,  conversation-analytic and network analytic traditions. We  developed the framework to make distributed interaction visible,  but also as a means of coordinating the various strands of our own  work. Initially we developed contingency and uptake graphs  through extensive use in manual analyses [30, 46]. Then we  implemented software tools for constructing contingency graphs  automatically from log files and developed rudimentary analytic  tools that leverage these representations [31, 32]; and we have  used associograms in ad-hoc computational analyses [43]. More  recently we developed a comprehensive Traces analytic toolkit  that is implemented in Java with Hibernate persistence and is  applicable to a variety of socio-technical networks. The Traces  design includes: (1) an Entity-Event-Contingency (EEC) core,  supporting the fundamental classes of Entity, Event, and  Contingency; and classes that are likely to be common to all  analyses (e.g., specializations of Entity into ArtifactBase,  ActorBase and IdeaBase abstract classes); (2) an Analytic Core   layer, including classes for Uptake, various types of  Contingencies, and Composites (CompositeEntity, e.g., discussion  forums; CompositeEvent, e.g., chat sessions; and  CompositeContingency, used to represent uptake); (3) a Domain  Core, with common domain objects such as Chat and  Contribution, Discussion and Message, etc. These cores are  extended for application to specific data sources such as Tapped- In, using (4) data source specific extensions to the Domain Core  such as Calendar Events (these may migrate to the core if they are  found to be useful across systems, and (5) classes that map the  data source databases and logs to the above.  Presently the Traces  toolkit does not include associograms: our analyses at the levels of  mediation and tie models are handled by exporting to other tools  available for the task at hand (e.g., Gephi, Jung, Pajek, and  UCINet). We have imported two years of data from Tapped-In,  and are conducting analyses to be reported in future publications.    10.2 Advantages for Communication and  Social Network Analysis  This paper outlines how the analytic framework supports  movement from log data to more abstract representations of  action, interaction, mediation and tie. This analytic framework  offers several advantages for the study of socio-technical systems  and network analysis. First, the framework facilitates the  transition from event data to communication and social network  data. This transition has been a source of methodological  difficulty for social network researchers, as the field is historically  based on self-report and observational data. Event log data exists  for much of the interaction across communication technology  platforms, particularly in online learning settings, but until  recently has remained largely untapped by learning and social  science researchers. Also, the framework can be applied to  integrate events distributed across a variety of media and their  logs (see also [20] for media multiplexity and [23] for cross  media SNA). Second, directional affiliation network analysis is  introduced. There is a growing body of research that represents  actors and group events as two modes of a network in a single  graph, but these affiliation networks generally do not account for  directionality between the two modes. The associogram captures  the direction of affiliation between the users and the media via  which they are associated. For example, one user may edit a  document and another may read it, resulting in a linear direction  between those participants that can be captured and preserved  when represented as an associogram. Third, temporality can be  introduced into a representation of a communication network. The  dynamic nature of events over time can be preserved in the  representation of contingencies, uptake and associograms.  Sociograms linking back to this derivation can recover the over- time nature of tie formation.   10.3 Multi-Level Analysis and Theoretical  Multivocality The analytic hierarchy is not just a data interpretation framework.  It is also intended to be a framework for connecting theorizing at  different levels. Developmentally, the framework arose out of our  own need to reconcile our research on small group interaction in  computer supported collaborative learning and online learning  contexts with our emerging research on online communities. It  was clear that studies of communication networks, and social  network analysis in particular, had something to offer, but the  ties of such analyses seemed to hide away the very processes  we were interested in: the interaction and how it was influenced   71    by and appropriated the media we were designing. Therefore we  constructed the framework as an explicit bridge between analyses  of local interaction and of larger social phenomena, with the  expectation that it would also guide our bridging between  theoretical explanations at these different levels.    This work is sympathetic to calls by Contractor and colleagues [8,  33] for multi-theoretical and multi-level (MTML) analyses and  models of communication networks, but is based on a different  conception of layering than MTML. The MTML approach calls  for examining (1) the properties of individual nodes  (incorporating attributed-based data); (2) properties of the  network under consideration (including dyadic, triadic and global  properties); and (3) relationships of this network to other relations  over the same network constituents or the same relations as they  change over time. These levels change the granularity or scope of  analysis, but stay within an ontology of structural relations  between a set of network constituents. Our hierarchical approach  adds a more vertical dimension, changing the ontology between  layers, from relationships between observed events, to mediated  associations, to direct ties between actors.   Marin & Wellman [29] contrast attribute based explanations,  which explain behavior in terms of attributes of individuals, with  the network analysis' position that causation is not located in the  individual, but in the social structure. Similarity of attributes is  explained by similarity of network positions, due to the similar  constraints, opportunities and perceptions created by these  similar network positions. We agree with their critique of  attribute-based explanations but wish to avoid the opposite  oversimplification: individuals similarities do not arise merely  out of static structures piping influences into the individuals from  without. A range of thinkers, including Garfinkel [16], Blumer [6]  and Latour [27] have argued (each in their own way) that social  regularities are constructed and sustained through interaction  between actors (whether strictly local interaction, as for Garfinkel,  or potentially mediated across time and space, as for Latour). To  fully understand social systems we must examine interaction.  Colleagues2 have offered the analogy that ethnomethodological  interaction is the quantum mechanics of social science. We can  ignore it when explaining social life at a Newtonian level, but to  really understand the origins of the social world we must dive in  and find how fluctuations in micro-phenomena can have an  influence on larger scale change. Latour [27] has made a similar  observation in claiming that the sociology of the social may  seem adequate for explanation of stable states of affairs, but  Actor-Network Theorys sociology of associations is needed to  understand rapidly changing networks.   Our position is that network structures are relevant because of  how they support interaction. The network structure is not  enough: to explain the origins of social life we must understand  the nature of the communication or interaction that takes place. In  socio-technical networks, this includes understanding how that  interaction is embedded in and exploits the resources of  technological infrastructures; i.e., how it is mediated. The present  work offers a conceptualization of how to map between these  different levels of theory and analysis, viz., structure, mediation,  and interaction; and also provides specific representations for  supporting analytic work with computational tools.    In addition to providing a unified analytic artifact and supporting  multiple levels of analysis, a third concern has motivated the work                                                                    2 Ravi Vatrapu, personal communication, July 28, 2007; David Sallach ,   personal communication, May 23, 2010  reported here. Researchers from multiple theoretical and analytic  traditions are studying distributed and networked learning, virtual  organizations, and similar socio-technical networks. This diversity  can mean balkanization, or it can be a strength. A single  integrated discipline of Learning Analytics may not be possible or  even desirable, but there must be some basis for dialogue and  coordination between the traditions. Shared instruments and  representations mediate the daily work of scientific discourse  [26], and advances in scientific disciplines are sometimes  accompanied with representational advances. Similarly,  researchers studying socio-technical networks could benefit from  shared ways of conceptualizing and representing distributed  interaction, or at least from boundary objects [41] that make  discourse between multiple analytic traditions possible. We offer  this framework as a potential basis productive discourse among  multiple analytic voices [47] in the study of socio-technical  networks such as networked learning by enabling the development  of shared conceptualizations, representations, and tools at a given  level of analysis and supporting bridging between different levels  of analysis.
