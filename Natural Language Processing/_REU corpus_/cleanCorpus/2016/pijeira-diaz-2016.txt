Much is known about its contribution to learning, but still investigating a process of collaboration remains a challenge. This paper approaches the investigation on col- laborative learning from a psychophysiological perspective. An experiment was set up to explore whether biosensors can play a role in analysing collaborative learning. On the one hand, we identified five physiological coupling indices (PCIs) found in the literature: 1) Signal Matching (SM), 2) Instan- taneous Derivative Matching (IDM), 3) Directional Agree- ment (DA), 4) Pearsons correlation coecient (PCC) and the 5) Fishers z-transform (FZT) of the PCC. On the other hand, three collaborative learning measurements were used: 1) collaborative will (CW), 2) collaborative learning product (CLP) and 3) dual learning gain (DLG). Regression analy- ses showed that out of the five PCIs, IDM related the most to CW and was the best predictor of the CLP. Meanwhile, DA predicted DLG the best. These results play a role in de- termining informative collaboration measures for designing a learning analytics, biofeedback dashboard.  CCS Concepts Information systems !

Labor market demands team players as todays chal- lenges require professionals to work with each other. The earlier students start developing collaboration skills the sooner they will be able to incorporate them to everyday life and work. The interest in collaboration therefore concerns the students of today and workforce of tomorrow, teachers and researchers as the most direct stakeholders. Studies on col- laborative learning have shown that collaboration promotes important cognitive activities, such as question asking, elab- orating own understanding, argumentation of various points of views and conclusion making [34]. Research has also shown that collaborative learning is not self-evident and that true collaboration is infrequent [3]. Reaching high-level cog- nitive processing is a demanding task [29], and cognitive challenges tend to cause tension and increase the poten- tial for both socio-emotional conflicts and poor collabora- tive learning experiences [36, 2]. More is needed to know about these socio-emotional and cognitive interaction pro- cesses, and new methodological solutions may oer what the earlier have not achieved. The measurement of collaboration in general is a challenge as such, as there are not enough in- dicators available so far. Operationalizing collaboration is not a straightforward process and there is not a single way to do it [16].  This paper approaches the collaboration quantification through Learning Analytics (LA) [54] and physiological data from biosensors. LA is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of learning data. It leverages information visu- alization, learning sciences, software engineering, statistics and data mining methods for providing feedback and aware- ness of the learning process. The interest in LA concerns a broad variety of roles: researchers in education, leaders and policy-makers, educational practitioners, organisational ad- ministrators, instructional designers, product vendors, and [...] the learners themselves [7].  The LA field started to develop from the bulk of digi- tal traces that came with the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Together with the open access to high quality ed- ucational resources, the MOOCs user-transparent tracking capabilities started to produce learning datasets of unprece- dented dimensions. To tackle the necessity of turning the  http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2883851.2883897   raw data into useful information and present it in friendly, relevant ways, the multidisciplinary field of LA emerged.  LA techniques are a powerful tool for sense-making of ed- ucational data [49]. This study on collaborative learning features applies LA to an increasingly available [51] data modality: physiological data. Activity from the cardiovascu- lar and electrodermal systems  just to name the two most popular physiological data sources in psychological studies [30]  has been linked to diverse cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes at both within- and between-subject research. We believe that tracking physiological data in learning situations can enrich the LA field, which has been mainly focused so far on digital traces.  Concurrently, collaborative learning research has relied on analysing transcribed verbal interactions and using self- reporting questionnaires [16]. There is a potential for com- plementing subjective reports with objective physiological data [11]. Wearable biosensors are gaining popularity in everyday life mostly for sports and fitness activity track- ing. Despite not being their primary purpose to date, these biosensors can also be used to study the cognitive and aec- tive domains of learning [46]. Physiological measures can be informative both at individual and group levels, each having a set of usages [11]. Therefore, we envision an application to monitor the learning process with wearables to provide timely feedback to the teacher and/or the learner. Before that promising future, extensive research is needed in three dimensions: 1) the physiological responses relevant for the learning process, 2) the significant features extractable from them, and 3) the learning-related psychological states they can describe. The field has been called Wearable Enhanced Learning1 (WELL) and the architecture has been referred to as sensor-based platforms [46].  There is a number of physiological responses. The multi- sensor wristband used in the experiment allowed for the recording of Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), electrodermal ac- tivity (EDA) and skin temperature. This study considers EDA. It is an easy measurable, sensitive response [12] that previous studies have linked to arousal [11, 38], attention [55], task engagement [40], and cognitive load [48], among others.  The notion of a relationship between the physiological re- sponses of two individuals interacting with each other has been long scientifically explored [31]. Little or no agree- ment on how to call this physiological relationship has been reached. The diverse nomenclature found includes (chrono- logically sorted): physiological linkage [31], physiological compliance [50], physiological synchronization [24], physio- logical correlation [15], joint changes in the physiological sig- nals [25], physiological coupling [11] and physiological mark- ers of togetherness [39]. From now on, this paper uses phys- iological coupling (PC) for the idea of influence it suggests. PC has been proposed for the assessment of social interac- tions and as a direct feedback [11].  To measure PC several indices have been used [35], six to our knowledge. [15] presented Signal Matching (SM), Instantaneous Derivative Matching (IDM) and Directional Agreement (DA). Pearsons correlation coecient (PCC) has also been employed [23] as well as a variation: its Fishers z-transform (FZT) [9] (i.e. the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the PCC). Weighted coherence (WC) was developed by [44]  1http://ea-tel.eu/special-interest-groups/well (Last ac- cessed: 20/10/2015)  for frequency domain analysis. This study obtained five of those PCIs  SM, IDM, DA,  PCC and FZT  from pairwise EDA time series to explore for the first time their ability to predict three collabora- tive learning features: 1) collaborative will, 2) collaborative learning product and 3) dual learning gain. The best pre- dictor for each was determined among the five PCIs.  Our near future goal is the design and development of a biofeedback dashboard for monitoring collaborative learn- ing with physiological data. Thus, apart from its value in the quantification of three collaboration features, this explo- ration is useful as a first step in determining those PCIs more informative for the dashboard and what they may signal.  The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 moti- vates the physiological signals application to learning. Sec- tion 3 details the experimental design, data collection and processing. The results coming out of the analysis are dis- cussed in section 4. Finally, conclusions and agenda points for further research are stated in section 5.  2. RATIONALE Biosensors are in a process of democratization. General-  purpose, low-cost, biosensors are increasingly available and becoming part of everyday life [51]. Technology has made possible the integration of a variety of sensors in a sin- gle device thanks to the progress in nanotechnology, low- power electronics and biosensor design [21]. Final prod- ucts in this category include, but are not limited to, smart- watches, wristband sensors, wearable sensor patches, and smartclothes. The multi-sensor approach is a trend in the in- dustry and the combination of cardiovascular activity, tem- perature, motion and EDA sensors has been regarded as the next-generation multi-sensor standard [51].  The physiological responses that biosensors record are orig- inated in the nervous system, of which a simplified view is presented in figure 1. There are two big groups of physio- logical responses depending on whether they are controlled by the Central Nervous System (CNS) or the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The CNS controls the brain and the spinal cord. The ANS innervates the electrodermal, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. ANS responses of- fer a great potential for research and physiological comput- ing since their measurement mechanisms are cheaper, faster and more unobtrusive than those of the CNS responses [38]. However, their easy measurement contrasts with the chal- lenge that their intricate interpretation represents. Inter- pretation is inextricably linked to context as several stimuli can produce the same physiological responses [8].  Figure 1: Nervous system simplification.    This paper considers the electrodermal system responses during a collaborative learning task. EDA phenomenon and measurement were first proposed in 1888 by Fere, who dis- covered a change in skin electric conductance elicited by external stimuli [18]. The increase in skin conductivity is caused by a sweat increment. Sweat production is induced by thermoregulatory and psychological mechanisms as well [12]. Therefore, a constant room temperature of 23 C is rec- ommended [5] to measure EDA produced by psychological sweat, the one of interest in psychophysiology.  Psychophysiology is the discipline that studies the infer- ence of psychological states from physiological responses. The psychological states comprise cognitive, emotional, and behavioural phenomena [8]. The first systematic work in psychophysiology is considered to be the 1915 publication Bodily changes in pain, hunger, fear and rageby the Amer- ican physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon, a pioneer in the study of the physiology of emotions [6]. Science is since looking for an improved understanding of the physiological footprints that psychological mechanisms leave.  The psychophysiological process is depicted in figure 2. The human body produces physiological responses as a re- sult of its own functioning or upon external stimuli. The physiological responses can be recorded into physiological signals by means of biosensors. Dierent sampling rates (i.e. number of measurements per time unit) are used depend- ing on the response and the application (see table 4 for the ones used in the experiment). Examples of physiological sig- nals are EDA, electrocardiogram (ECG), electrooculogram (EOG), electromiogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), among others. The same physiological response can be recorded as dierent physiological signals depending on the biosensor used. Thus for example, cardiovascular activ- ity can be recorded as ECG or as BVP signals depending on whether an electrocardiograph or photoplethysmograph sensor are used respectively.  Every signal in turn has a number of physiological fea- tures. The features can be descriptive statistics such as the mean and the standard deviation, or signal-specific such as the heart rate extracted from either the ECG or BVP sig- nals, or the Skin Conductance Level (SCL) and Skin Con- ductance Response (SCR) extracted from the EDA signal. Statistical features are clearly common to all the signals, while the number of signal-specific features varies from sig- nal to signal. Typically, studies use from a couple to less than a dozen features, but at least 128 features from 4 sig- nals have been used [19]. This provides a rough idea on how many features are extractable from physiological sig- nals. Physiological features can be extracted both at indi- vidual and group levels. The physiological features are the final numbers to be interpreted so as to determine the psy- chological state. Either the number or the interpretation could be provided as biofeedback in applications.  A scientific review of research on the physiology of emotion [30] reported that the most common physiological responses used in the field are heart rate and EDA in that order.  There is widespread documentation on EDA proportion- ality to arousal (psychological activation) [38]. Significant dierences in EDA have been observed between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, that is, it can indicate valence [11]. EDA is highly sensitive to the novelty, intensity and perceived sig- nificance of stimulus [55]. An increase in cognitive load has also been reported to have a match in EDA rise. These are  Figure 2: Biofeedback process (adapted from [38]).  just examples of EDA expressiveness at the individual level. The computer science field has been attracted to psy-  chophysiology. Aective computing [41] is devoted to the variety of applications of machines able to recognize and properly respond to human emotions. It is based on the principle that no intelligent system is possible without emo- tions. Physiological computing [17] is a generalization of the aective computing field to include also cognitive com- puting, aimed at increasing user performance in contrast to the improved user satisfaction goal of aective computing. Although the very high complexity of psychophysiological inference and validation remains a hurdle, it has been sug- gested that even low accuracy psychophysiological inferences may be informative [11]. Potential applications would be ground-breaking and paradigm-changing [38], and learning might not be an exception.  Applications to the learning area include, but are not lim- ited to, interaction support [11], feedback [46], intelligent tutors [1], the current educational challenge of formative as- sessment [45], intervention [14], teacher training [22], emo- tion recognition in e-learning [47] and self-regulated learning [37]. A recent review on sensor-based platforms [46] did not identify prototypes purposely focused on learning applica- tions. Nevertheless, most prototypes were found to have capabilities relevant to at least one of the three learning do- mains [4]: cognitive, aective and psychomotor. Therefore, there is a need for and a lack of research on how can biosen- sors leverage the learning process [46, 47] at both individual and group scales.  PCIs and collaboration At group level the physiological features are the PCIs, dif- ferent indices to measure the relationship between the phys- iological signals of individuals within the group. Six PCIs have been used in research to our knowledge: SM, IDM, DA, PCC, FZT and WC. Signal Matching (SM) accounts for the pairwise dierence between the signals once they have been normalized. The need for normalization comes from the fact that physiological signal levels are strongly dependent on individual characteristics [12]. Instantaneous Derivative Matching (IDM) compares the rate of change of physiological signals from a dyad by means of the derivative. Directional Agreement (DA) represents the per cent of data points going in the same direction across individuals (i.e. going up, down or staying constant at the same time). It is the most basic PCI. The Pearsons correlation coecient    (PCC) determines the strength of the linear relationship be- tween the physiological signals from two individuals. The Fishers z-transform (FZT) is a transformation of PCC  by applying the inverse hyperbolic tangent  so as to obtain a normally distributed index. FZT is basically the same as PCC for values between -0.5 and 0.5. Weighted Coherence (WC) is a frequency domain PCI and therefore more useful for periodic physiological responses such as the heart beat and the respiration rate. Since EDA is the signal this study is focused on and it is not a periodical signal, WC has not been considered.  According to each PCI definition, the higher the values the higher or lower the PC. This direct or inverse relationship is summarised in table 1, together with the property that each PCI measures. By definition, PCIs are mostly computed pairwise, being DA the exception. DA can be calculated for as many individuals as desired. PCIs can be obtained on either an instantaneous or aggregated basis. Aggregated can be either for time windows, say for example 65s as in [15], or for the whole measurement session. They can all be aggregated but not all can be computed on an instantaneous basis. PCC and FZT are meaningless calculated for a single instant. Although in this study aggregated values for the whole collaborative learning task are used for the prediction of collaboration features, instantaneous values might have the power to detect particular points of interest in the study of collaboration. It has been claimed that understanding the underlying mechanisms of collaborative learning requires research to zoom in the collaborative interactions [13].  Table 1: Summary of PCIs meaning PCI Interpretation Value PC  SM dierence lower higher IDM rate of change lower higher DA direction higher higher PCC linear relationship higher higher FZT weighted mean PCC higher higher  PCIs can play a role in studying the social interactions [11] by providing an objective measure, although research in this direction remain scarce. A relatively small number of studies has focused on the PC phenomenon [25], as most of the research carried out in psychophysiology and applica- tions has targeted the individual rather than the group level [11]. Although insucient, psychophysiological research for collaboration has proved promising.  Evidence has been found for a connection between PC and team performance [35], with PCC and DA of cardiovascu- lar activity being the most sensitive indices to dierences between low and high performers [15]. PCC of heart rate in dyads has been reported to predict task completion time [23]. Also in dyads, PC has been associated to interaction and self-reported social presence [25, 10]. Conflicting in- teractions have been reflected in a significantly higher PC increment than that of collaborative interactions by means of the PCC index [10]. The directionality of the PC might point to who is the group leader [11]. Some of the collabora- tion features studied from the PC phenomenon perspective are listed in table 2 together with the PCIs employed.  Physiological signals are valuable social cues for the study of collaborative learning. Dierent collaboration features have been previously studied. This paper enriches the field  Table 2: Some collaboration features studied through PCIs Collaboration feature Study PCIs  Team performance [15, 35] SM, IDM, DA, PCC Interaction [25] PCC, WC Task completion time [23] PCC, WC Conflicting interactions [10] PCC Team work [22] PCC, WC  with three collaborative learning specific features that have not been approached through PCIs before.  3. METHOD Based on the exposed rationale, we post the research ques-  tions:  1. Which PCI reflects better the collaborative will  2. Which PCI predicts the collaborative learning product and the dual learning gain the best  At this point it is convenient to remember that the PCIs are calculated on a certain physiological response  EDA in this study. Therefore, it has to be kept in mind that here the answer to the research questions is linked to and valid only for the EDA signal. Further studies are needed for the comparison of PCIs across dierent physiological responses.  3.1 Setting An experiment was conducted in the University of Oulus  Learning and Interaction Observation Forum (LeaForum2). This state-of-the-art research infrastructure was designed as a roomy, cosy space for up to 30 people. It is a convertible facility with flexible fittings to allow provision for dierent group situations. LeaForum is equipped with:   a proprietary observation and recording system [27];  trapezoidal tables convenient for group work;  14 tablets connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi;  6 Empatica S3 biosensors [20];  2 eye tracking glasses; and  a backstage room prepared to follow the experiments  in real time through the live video signals.  The video recording system is able to collect 360 video and high-quality audio from multiple microphones. The trapezoidal tables allow for a suitable and comfortable group setting, as they form an heptagon when seven of them are sided consecutively. In front and close to each teams ta- bles, there was a table supplied with a variety of food items (cardboard boxes, plastic bags, fruits...) relevant for the task.  The tablets enabled the students to take pictures, search information on the web, respond to online questionnaires and access weSPOT [33], the virtual learning environment (VLE) used. WeSPOT is a working environment with social and personal open tools for Inquiry Based Learning (IBL).  The Empatica S3 wristband is a multi-sensor device es- pecially designed for research purposes. Four sensors come embedded: 1) a photoplethysmograph (for cardiovascular  2http://leaforum.fi (Last accessed: 20/10/2015)    activity), 2) a thermometer, 3) an accelerometer, and 4) an EDA sensor. Two modes of operation are available: 1) real time Bluetooth streaming and 2) internal memory recording. The latter was used. Ambient temperature in LeaForum is usually controlled by means of a thermostat to be 23C, the recommended temperature to measure EDA [5].  3.2 Participants Participants in the experiment were 48 high-school stu-  dents from the University of Oulus Teacher Training School. Students came from six dierent classes and were aged 16 to 19. Gender distribution was 27 females and 21 males. No previous knowledge was required. The task was coordinated with their science teachers so that it was included within their course work, meaning it did not supposed extra eort for the students. Participation in the study was voluntary.  3.3 Task description The task design in close collaboration with the students  science teachers ensured that it was aligned with their cog- nitive level. It also made it meaningful for their current studies. The experiment was run four times. The task was the same but two levels of scripting were used: guided and unguided  two runs each.  The task consisted in the design of a healthy, appropriate breakfast for an athlete training for a marathon. The spec- ification of parameters included age, height, weight, daily caloric intake, number of weekly trainings and session length. Students were provided with two Google-DocsR files: a document and a spreadsheet. For both guided and un- guided runs, the document contained a general description of marathon runners nutritional needs. The spreadsheet had a template with rows for food items and columns for the weight (in grams) of the dierent nutrients contained by the food item. Several examples were provided.  The unguided task required students to search on the In- ternet which and how much of each nutrient a marathon runner needs for breakfast. They were asked to write their most relevant findings on the nutrients and their function.  In the guided runs of the experiment the provided doc- ument already contained the recommendation for the com- position of the athletes breakfast in per cent of each nu- trient, energy consumption of marathon runners as well as the description and organic role of nutrient categories such as carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and fat. Students were prompted the steps to follow through the VLE. The steps according to the IBL paradigm were 1) plan the design method, 2) set the criteria, 3) collect the data, 4) discuss the findings, and 5) communicate the results.  3.4 Procedure A pre-test and a Motivated Strategies for Learning Ques-  tionnaire (MSLQ) [43] were applied to the participants two weeks in advance to the laboratory experiment. The aims were on the one side to have a preliminary evaluation of students previous knowledge on the task subject, motiva- tion and attitudes towards learning; and on the other side to have a group formation criterion. The MSLQ question- naire is considered a social-cognitive view of motivation and self-regulation of learning. Students scores in each of the two tests were categorized in low, middle and high. These categories were then used as the basis to form the groups as heterogeneously as possible.  Students were organized in 16 triads for the collaborative task. Due to LeaForum capacity and the number of avail- able biosensors, the experiment was run four times in two consecutive days, a morning and afternoon run each day. The unguided task was used in the first days sessions. On the contrary, second days sessions were carried out with the guided task.  Every session lasted for two hours (on task) and fifteen minutes (preparation). At the beginning of each session, the students were introduced to LeaForum and its equip- ment, especially the sensors they were to wear throughout the task. Each student was provided with a tablet and a microphone for the videotaping. Two students in separate groups were wearing eye-tracking glasses each run. The six biosensors available at LeaForum allowed for the physiolog- ical tracking of two groups each session. After the sensor familiarization, the collaborative learning task together with the VLE were explained. Having completed the task under- standing phase, students started to work with their groups. During the whole experiment, two researchers from the team were around to handle possible issues with the task or the equipment. The rest of the research team was following the experiment from LeaForums backstage room, prepared for observation without causing disturbance or distraction to students.  Upon task completion, students delivered a report with their solution via the VLE. Finally, they were asked to take the post-test.  3.5 Collected data The number of sensors available formed a limitation for  tracking every student. In addition, as the task was collab- orative, not all the students interacted with the VLE (task distribution). From the capability to track the physiolog- ical responses of 24 students (6 biosensors  4 runs), the real number was reduced to 20 due to four cases of device misplacement. Those 20 were the students we finally con- sidered for this study from the experiment data focused on EDA. The total number of students in each data modality collected is specified in table 3.  Table 3: Students tracked in each data modality Data modality Students  Pre-, post- and MSLQ questionnaires 48/48 Videotaping 48/48 VLE activity logs 33/48 Wristband biosensors 20/48 Eye-tracking 8/48  At the group level, data from the biosensors is distributed as follows: 5 groups with all three members tracked, 2 groups with two out of the three members tracked and 1 group with a single member tracked. The latter cannot be used therefore to measure collaboration, but it can be compared to students working in other groups during the same session for contrasting the PCIs of people working together with those of people working simultaneously but in other teams.  The dimensions of the data appear in table 4. The sample frequency specifies the number of measurements the biosen- sors collect every second. Thus for example, EDA data for each participant adds up to around 28,800 samples (tak- ing four samples a second during approximately two hours).    Considering the 20 participants tracked with this data modal- ity, accounts for over half a million records.  Table 4: Physiological data dimensions Data Units Sample frequency (Hz)  Temperature C 4 EDA S 4 BVP nW 64 Accelerometer 1/64g 32 IBI s  Pupil diameter mm 64  BVP is the direct measure coming from the photoplethys- mograph sensor. BVP peaks indicate a heart beat. Using the BVP signal an Empatica proprietary algorithm extracts the interbeat interval (IBI) (i.e. the time in between two consecutive heart beats), from which in turn heart rate is calculated.  From the data collected, figure 3 is very illustrative of the power of EDA data. There, the EDA signals have been syn- chronized first among themselves and then with the video. The figure shows shadowed an interval where there is an almost simultaneous peak in the three EDA responses. A video inspection reveals that the peak occurs at the time the team feels that something has gone wrong with the VLE, that is, a technical challenge. It is also seen in the image that the student in the middle has taken his hands to his head, signaling thereby that he is worried. The figure shows also the individual dierences in the level of the EDA sig- nal. As it has been stated before, EDA is strongly dependent on individual characteristics, and so are other physiological responses.  Figure 3: Challenge-driven team EDA peaks.  3.6 Data processing Data processing steps are summarized in figure 4. After the collection the data had a high degree of sparsity.  Dierent sources usually imply dierent formats. Even raw  Physiological data Pre-processing  Individual syncingArtifact detection  Normalization Group syncing  PCI calculationCorrelation  Figure 4: Physiological data processing.  data coming from the same source may be separated. This is the case of the biosensors. The five magnitudes they provide (first five rows in table 4) are each saved to a dierent file. File format is typically comma separated values (CSV) with a first row indicating the start recording time, a second row displaying the sample frequency and the remaining rows for the measured values. First step is therefore to have the data in such a way that every value is time stamped for each magnitude and participant (pre-processing).  The synchronization of multimodal data and even within the same data modality is a challenge [11, 28]. It is also a core process for the exploration of PCIs as they rely on responses happening at the very same instant. Otherwise the results would not be reliable. Mostly manual synchro- nization was performed in the data processing. Automated mechanisms are under study for the goal of a timely, learning- oriented, biofeedback dashboard.  We chose to begin the physiological signals synchroniza- tion within individuals with a magnitude sampled at 4Hz, which is the maximum common divisor of the sampling fre- quencies in table 4. Thus, starting with temperature, the physiological signals were synchronized using Microsoft Ex- cel VLOOKUP function one participant and signal at a time (individual synchronization).  Biosensor recordings may include artifacts as a result of a variation in the contact between the skin and the sen- sor due to pressure, excessive movement, or adjustment of the device [52]. There is a need to detect those artifacts to prevent wrong data from distorting the analysis. Three free applications were found for the processing of EDA data: Ledalab [26], EDA Explorer [52] and PsPM3. Ledalab allows for the manual detection of artifacts. PsPM does not in- clude this feature either in manual or automatic way. EDA Explorer automatically detects artifacts based on 5-second epoch classification. EDA Explorer was therefore used to categorize EDA data points into signal or noise (artifact de- tection). As a result, 90% of the EDA data (490,880 from 547,848 records) was classified as correct and the remaining 10% was taken out of the analysis.  The strong dependence of EDA values on individual char- acteristics makes a normalization process necessary for com- parability  at least for the level-dependent PCIs. EDA sig- nals are then brought to a baseline. Normalization was done by computing the t-scores (i.e. subtracting the sample mean from every value and then dividing by the sample standard deviation). Both sample mean and standard deviation were computed on an individual basis.  3http://pspm.sourceforge.net (Last accessed: 20/10/2015)    To explore the collaboration through physiological responses, a second synchronization has to be done to align the data across individuals. The group synchronization is carried out on a session basis, meaning for all the individuals tracked with biosensors within a session.  The indices SM, IDM and DA were computed according to [15]; PCC with lag 0 as in [23] and FZT following [9]. PCIs were obtained pairwise for all team member combina- tions (AB, AC and BC) to ensure a greater index reliability [22]. The instantaneous values were then aggregated as the arithmetic mean throughout the collaborative learning ses- sion. The mean over a certain time period is a commonly accepted physiological feature [38]. As a result of the whole process, five 21x21 matrices were obtained, one for each PCI.  3.7 Collaborative learning measures Three collaborative learning measures (CLMs) were used  in the study: 1) collaborative will (CW), 2) collaborative learning product (CLP) and 3) dual learning gain (DLG).  The predisposition to collaborate in a learning task, that is, the CW, was measured using the peer learning scale of the MSLQ questionnaire. MSLQ is a widely used self-report instrument with 81 items distributed in two sections  mo- tivation and learning strategies  with 6 and 9 scales re- spectively. Students rate ranges from 1 (not at all true of me) to 7 (very true of me). The peer learning scale com- prises three items  numbers 34, 45 and 50  in which the students rate their willingness to explain learning material to their team members, work together with others to com- plete a learning assignment and discuss task material with the team. Individual MSLQ scales are analysed by averag- ing the ratings of the dierent items the scale is comprised of. Therefore, the CW measured in this way ranges from 1 to 7, just as the individual items.  The CLP was measured by the score of the report deliv- ered by the students after the task. The report included two files: 1) a document with their task notes and conclusions, and 2) a spreadsheet with their task solution. The assess- ment criteria involved the diversity of the solution (number of nutrients considered), depth of the answer, accuracy and focus on the problem. The scoring scale ranges from 4 to 15 points.  The individual learning gain was computed by subtracting pre-test from post-tests scores. DLG was then calculated as the sum of the individual learning gains.  4. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS Figure 5 shows in a scatter chart with smooth lines the  pairwise PCI values and the CLMs sorted from left to right by descendent CLP. The figure illustrates nearly the same behaviour between FZT and PCC. Therefore, they may be considered redundant PCIs and it is simpler to use PCC instead of FZT, as FZT is a derivative measure of PCC and thus requires further calculation, which in turn translates into no added benefit.  With the five PCIs computed on the one side, and the three CLMs on the other side, fifteen regression analyses were performed pairwise (see figure 6). The aim was to explore the power of every PCI to predict each CLM and thereby being able to answer the research questions. The results are summarized in table 5.  In addition, a regression analysis was performed between pre- and post-test scores. High correlation (0.86) was found  between the two tests, with the pre-test score being able to predict 74% of the post-test scores variance. The regression line obtained is displayed in figure 7. The line has a positive slope (0.70), indicating that in general there was a positive learning gain for participants in the experiment.  Table 5: Correlations in the regression analyses CLM SM IDM DA PCC FZT  CW 0.01 0.50 0.12 0.09 0.09 CLP 0.13 0.59 0.12 0.32 0.35 DLG 0.27 0.20 0.70 0.17 0.17  In general, weak correlation (below 0.3) was found among the PCIs and the CLM. IDM showed a moderate to strong correlation with the CW (0.5) and the CLP (0.59). IDM was therefore the best predictor for those CLMs. DA revealed a strong correlation to the DLG (0.7), meaning it explains almost half of DLG variation (determined by the square of the correlation coecient). This might indicate that while the linearity (i.e. proportional changes) in the EDA of stu- dents learning collaboratively appears to have no predictive power, the direction in which the signals are changing could tell about the resulting learning gain.  Once again the simplest solution proved to be the better. DA is the simplest of the PCIs, yet it yielded the highest correlation in the regression analysis. This is in agreement with former studies finding DA as the most sensitive PCI to dierences in team performance [15]. It is also the most powerful at group level by enabling the computation of one index for all the members and not only pairwise, which is a common limitation of the other PCIs. In addition, DA does not require normalization thanks to its level independence, being just driven by the direction of change as the name itself implies. All of this means that DA can get to a dashboard quicker than its counterparts, making it the most suitable PCI for real time applications.  It is also worth stating that this study is not without its limitations. The sample size was bounded by the number of biosensors available. Also, the experiment was conducted in a laboratory setting, which diers from the students nat- ural learning environments. The EDA signal was recorded from a single wrist  as in the overwhelming majority of studies using EDA, but research has shown that EDA is an asymmetrical response (i.e. it manifests dierent in left and right hemispheres) [32, 42]. Therefore, recording EDA in the two wrists might oer additional information.  5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK A physiological approach to collaborative learning research  has been presented. This study used the EDA records from the rich multimodal dataset produced in the experiment. EDA, a measure of psychological sweat if temperature is kept constant, has been linked in former studies to cognitive and emotional processes. Here, five PCIs were calculated from the EDA of students working collaboratively to inves- tigate for the first time their possible connection to three collaborative learning features. The best predictor for each of the latter was obtained from the PCIs: IDM for the CW and the CLP; and DA for the DLG.  Further studies on the applications of EDA to the learn- ing sciences should consider the laterality eect. Lateral measures need to be compared and correlated to learning    Figure 5: PCI and learning measures.  Figure 6: Pairwise regression analyses.

But it may also turn out that none of them could be safely ruled out.  EDA is valuable as a highly sensitive index of psychologi- cal activation, but other physiological responses also deserve to be explored. The PCIs predictive power is likely to vary across physiological responses, and it is of interest to find out which physiological response maximizes the PCIs corre- lation to dierent learning features.  Research is needed with focus on whether there is a PC among people in a collaborative setting. An experiment de- sign might be to track the physiological signals of a num- ber of individuals working alone. Then, the individuals are asked to work in groups. The physiological responses in the two situations can be compared to find changes. The con-  trast of PCI values alone and in group can tell if the PC phenomenon occurred.  As biosensors are becoming more and more common in everyday life, we believe that they can increase the acces- sibility to a data source with potential to enrich the LA field. They can be used as input for a learning-oriented biofeedback dashboard in a computer supported collabora- tive learning (CSCL) context. Such a dashboard is the next milestone in our research agenda.  6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study is funded by the Academy of Finland, SLAM  project number: 275440.
