In this regard social network  analysis (SNA) has emerged as one of the cornerstones of learning  analytics methodologies. However, despite the noted importance  of social networks for facilitating the learning process, it remains  unclear how and to what extent such network measures are  associated with specific learning outcomes. Motivated by  Simmels theory of social interactions and building on the  argument that social centrality does not always imply benefits, this  study aimed to further contribute to the understanding of the  association between students social centrality and their academic  performance. The study reveals that learning analytics research  drawing on SNA should incorporate both  descriptive and  statistical methods to provide a more comprehensive and holistic  understanding of a students network position. In so doing  researchers can undertake more nuanced and contextually salient  inferences about learning in network settings. Specifically, we  show how differences in the factors framing students interactions  within two instances of a MOOC affect the association between  the three social network centrality measures (i.e., degree,  closeness, and betweenness) and the final course outcome.

INTRODUCTION  Social network analysis (SNA) has been one of the most   commonly applied methods in learning analytics research [1, 2].  Network approaches can extend analyses beyond the individual  level to focus on group dynamics. As such, SNA can provide  insight into the quantity and types of interactions or relationships  that occur between participants, groups and communities in  conventional as well as online settings [1, 3, 4]. Recently, with the  development of social networking sites that allow for a relatively  straightforward extraction of social networks, the application of  SNA in education has significantly increased [1, 5, 6]. However,  despite the volume of SNA applied within education research, few  studies have fully realized the potential of network analyses to  provide new insights into our understanding of learning [3].   Although SNA provides a rich set of tools and methods that help  improve the understanding of learning in social networks [3, 7],  the majority of the studies utilizing SNA in education are  primarily based on examining structural regularities underlying  student interactions [4, 8]. Researchers mainly rely on network  structural properties (e.g., centrality and density) [9, 10] or  generative processes (e.g., triad closure), usually observed in  isolation [8], to describe emerging patterns of students  engagement. For example, by examining measures of centrality,  embeddedness or triadic closure in social networks, researchers  can reveal who is interacting with whom and what is the strength  of interactions, the actors occupying more central or peripheral  positions in the network, and how such network engagement  patterns can affect learning [3, 4, 10, 11]. Although with limited  generalizability, such analyses are of great importance in  uncovering weak and strong ties that bridge communities/groups  of students, revealing the most influential actors or individuals  that may have a more advantageous position [12, 13].

Although models  for descriptive analysis help explain the association between  network variables and identify potentially relevant processes in  the network structure, they do not allow for the generalization of  findings across the networks. The lack of inferential power that  characterizes these mathematical, descriptive models (e.g.,  measuring centrality or density) is indirectly depicted through the  interpretation of the association between learning outcome and  measures of students social centrality. Despite the prevailing, and  largely unchallenged, understanding that occupying a higher  social centrality leads to a higher academic performance [3, 9,  10], research findings are inconclusive about which centrality  measure (or combination of measures) is the most significant  predictor of academic achievement. Additionally, several recent  studies have revealed somewhat contradictory results, indicating  that the predictive power of social centrality measures highly  depends on the context that frames students interactions [11, 14].    A potential rationale for explaining the inconsistencies in the  educational research may lie in the lack of accountability for the  network context that frames social interactions [15, 16]. Research  and practice in learning analytics commonly relies on general  models (i.e., context independent) in order to inform learning and  teaching processes, predict learning outcomes or provide  appropriate scaffolds [15]. However, without considering specific  learning settings, those models could lead to incomplete  conclusions. Likewise, applying SNA without accounting for the  processes that guide network formation and consideration of the  quantity and quality of interactions could also result in a model  that does not reliably capture the underlying social processes [8].  Thus, in order to provide for more valid inferences and identify  the determinants that explain regularities of network formation, a  sound theoretical approach driving the choice of the analytics  methods is required. In so doing, the theory driven approach can  help explain the underlying network structure and provide the  context for the interpretation of revealed social processes.   1.1 SNA and MOOC research  The emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has  provided new opportunities for the application of SNA among  researchers and practitioners interested in studying networked  learning [17, 18]. Given the high numbers of students enrolling  into MOOCs [19] and the immense amount of data related to  students participation and interaction collected by MOOC  platforms, it has become even more challenging to understand  patterns that drive learning in such networked settings. Therefore,  studies investigating MOOCs have relied on SNA methods in  order to visualize and examine regularities in interactions  emerging from social learning activities that students and teachers  engage with [20, 21], as well as to investigate the association  between centrality in social networks and student performance  [11, 14], to name a few. However, this research while valuable,  still fails to adequately account for both context and the structural  properties of the established networks.   To address this deficit the present study incorporates both theory  related to the importance of super-strong ties [16, 22] in  network development as well as the statistical methods for  generalizing network inference, i.e., Exponential Random Graph  Models (ERGMs) [23]. The study analyses two separate instances  of the same MOOC offered in different languages during the same   period of time. In so doing, the study aims to provide further  evidence for the importance of accounting for the contextually  salient determinants that define network formation when studying  social networks. In the following, we compared two social  networks, emerging from student discussions, with respect to the  statistical properties that define underlying network structures  [23]. We utilized statistical network analysis (i.e., ERGMs  specifically), rather than mathematical (descriptive) methods, as it  is a more comprehensive approach to explaining uncertainty  inherent in the observed data and determining which of the  network processes present significant factors that frame the  network evolution [4, 8, 23]. Finally, following the differences in  the regularities framing the social relations within the two  networks analyzed, we examined the association between social  centrality measures (i.e., degree, closeness, and betweenness) and  the academic performance (i.e., obtained certificate  none,  normal, distinct), within the different contexts.    2. BACKGROUND  2.1 Social Network Analysis in Educational  Research  The initial application of SNA dates back to the 1930s involving a  Harvard study that analyzed interpersonal relations and the  formation of cliques [24]. The concept of social centrality was  first introduced in the 1940s, with a significant uptake noted in  the 1950s and the 1960s [9, 24]. Nevertheless, from these early  studies it appeared that while the researchers at the time agreed  that centrality is an important structural property of social  networks, there was a lack of consensus regarding what centrality  means and how it should be measured [9]. In his seminal work,  Freeman (1979) revisited the concept of centrality and identified  three network structural properties that should be considered as a  measure of centrality  degree, closeness, and betweenness. In  formal online courses, SNA studies have aimed at revealing  whether and how those structural properties, as defined by  Freeman (1979) and others, are associated with learning.  However, different studies have often produced contradicting  results. For example, Russo and Koesten [25] showed that  network prestige (in-degree) and centrality (out-degree)  significantly predict cognitive learning outcomes. Cho and  colleagues [26] also concluded that network centrality measures  were significantly and positively associated with a students final  grade. However, results from Cho and colleagues [26] also  revealed that only closeness centrality was a significant predictor  of the course grade. The association between grades and the other  two centrality measures  i.e., degree and betweenness centrality -  was not statistically significant. Gaevi and colleagues [27] also  observed a significant association between grade point average  (GPA) and two measures of network centrality (eccentricity and  closeness centrality) in a fully online master of science in  information systems program. However, similar to the Cho et als  [26] study, Gaevi and colleagues [27] also failed to find a  significant association between GPA and degree and betweenness  centrality. Thus, without detailed contextual information it  becomes challenging to conclude which of the centrality measures  are considered important predictors of a students overall  academic achievement. More simply put, the absence of context  limits our understanding of how network position influences  student learning.  Research in MOOCs further argues for the necessity to account  for various contextual factors when interpreting SNA in     networked learning settings. Specifically, contemporary research  shows that the association between student centrality in MOOC  discussion forums and academic performance, depends on the  context of the course [11, 14]. For example, Jiang and colleagues  [14], analyzed the association between degree, betweenness and  closeness centrality and student grades within two MOOCs in  Algebra and Financial Planning. While the results indicated a  significant and positive association between the final course grade  and two centrality measures (degree and betweenness) for the  Algebra MOOC, none of the measures were significantly  correlated with the student grades for the Financial Planning  MOOC. Further, the approach applied in the study by Dowell and  colleagues [11] differs from the traditional application of SNA in  MOOCs. More precisely, Dowell et al. [11] aimed at predicting  two different achievement measures final course grade and social  centrality  using linguistic properties of student generated  content. Results showed that the linguistic characteristics  positively associated with social centrality were negatively  associated with the final course grade, and vice versa. Although  Dowell and colleagues [11] did not directly compare social  centrality and course grades, their findings indicate that these two  measures of learning tend to capture different achievement  metrics, suggesting further that the skills associated with these  two learning-related outcomes differ (p.7, ibid.).  This review of the existing literature, suggests that future research  should provide additional insight into the contextual factors that  may impact on the association between students position in the  network and their learning outcomes. Instead of focusing solely  on the network structural properties to describe patterns of  students engagement within MOOC discussion forums, we aim to  utilize statistical network analysis to provide contextual  information about the processes that stimulate the underlying  network formation. Particularly, we aim to reveal important  regularities in interaction structure among the course participants  that could provide a valid context for the interpretation of network  structural properties. It should be noted that contextual factors are  not necessarily related to the course design and instructional  conditions. Here, we observe context in terms of the factors that  frame individuals social behavior. According to Simmel [28] the  nature of interaction between the two individuals in a social  network is derived from the collective behavior, which accounts  for the general social situation that goes beyond the two focal  parties.    2.2 Simmelian Ties Theory  In addition to the direct measures of the network structural  properties, SNA research should also consider the contextual  factors that influence the development of the network. The most  influential research in SNA argues that those individuals who  occupy more central roles (primarily focusing on betweenness  centrality) will have higher potential to benefit from such  positions and attain their goals [9, 13, 29]. Thus, in his seminal  work, Granovetter [13] argued that weak ties are those that enable  more straightforward access to information disseminated through  a social network. Burt [12] goes even further arguing that the  strength of ties is not as relevant as the fact that a given tie bridges  otherwise distinct groups or cliques in the social network. As Burt  noted [p]eople whose networks bridge the structural holes  between groups have an advantage in detecting and developing  rewarding opportunities [30, p. 354]. Both theories are in line  with Freemans [9] definition of centrality and assume that the  more central persons in a social network occupy a more  advantageous position. Nevertheless, Krackhardt [16] posits that   centrality does not necessarily imply less constraints and more  benefit. If a node is linked in what Krackhardt [16] calls a  Simmelian tie, such a position could impose additional  limitations. In the context of the present study, this could suggest  that while a student centrally positioned in the network has a high  potential for control over the information flow, the actual realized  gains for their learning may be diminished. Therefore, as  Krackhardt [16] posits, traditional SNA analysis (in his case  traditional role analysis) should be supported with Simmelian Ties  analysis. In the present study, we argue that Simmelian Ties  Theory [28] presents a sound theoretical framework in providing  valid context for interpreting the importance of social centrality  for the academic achievement.   Simmels theory of social behavior focuses on studying  relationships that occur between people in order to explain their  actions [16, 28]. Simmel argued that context is the primary factor  influencing what people do and why they behave in a particular  manner. Context is determined by the set of third others who also  engage in various relationships with the two focal parties [31, p.  16]. Thus, as Simmel argued, the establishment of such triadic  nodes should be the fundamental unit of analysis in order to  understand social behavior [16, 28]. Triads are considered to be  qualitatively different from the dyadic relationships that Burt [12]  and Granovetter [13], among others, focus on [16, 22]. This  difference originates in the nature of the formed relationships. The  two nodes forming a dyad are more independent and retain more  individuality in their relationship [16, 22]. For instance, should  disagreement occur in a dyad, both parties can choose to cease  any further interaction. However, a triadic tie requires a higher  level of negotiation. If a member of a group disagrees and ceases  further interaction the group remains to exist and a connection  remains. Thus, Krackhardt [22] described Simmelian ties as  super-strong (p.24), ties that qualitatively add durability and  power (p.24, ibid.), beyond the strong ties as previously defined  by Granovetter [13] and Krackhardt [32].   Simmelian ties theory differs from psychological theories, such as  Heiders [33] balance theory, in explaining structural properties  for the existence of symmetric and transitive triples, that are  considered main processes in social networks [16]. According to  Heiders [33] theory, people are motivated to establish and  maintain relationships that would allow them to keep comfortable  communicating with others. The Simmelian theory, on the other  hand, assumes that once cliques are formed, they resist changing,  becoming strong and stable, thus decreasing propensity to  dissolve over time [28]. However, there is no inherent  motivation to form a clique [31, p. 21], it is rather the social  structure, or the context, that causes formation of certain network  structures [28].   Building further on one of Krackhardts [22] conclusions (i.e.,  that traditional SNA should be supported with Simmelian ties  analysis), and given the theorized relationship between the social  centrality and the expected benefits, it seems reasonable to  analyze whether networks under study exhibit properties of  Simmelian ties. In the educational context, such strong ties could  indicate the existence of tightly connected groups, focused around  common interests.   2.3 Exponential random graph models in  Online Learning  A majority of studies applying SNA in online and distance  education relies on mathematical models to describe relationships  between observed variables [34]. Such studies are particularly     useful in revealing important network characteristics or what  processes should be observed within the social network [8]. For  example, using descriptive models we would be able to determine  whether Simmelian ties exist in a given network. However, in  order to reveal whether these processes (i.e., propensity to form  super-strong ties) occur more often than expected if ties were  generated randomly, as well as what other micro-level processes  (e.g., popularity, propensity for triad closure) determine social  dynamics in a given network, we need to rely on statistical models  [8]. The quadratic assignment procedure for analyzing dyadic data  sets [35], Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) and  stochastic blockmodels for the cross-sectional social network  analysis and community detection [23, 36], as well as longitudinal  models for studying evolution of networks and behavior [37] are  some of the commonly proposed methods. ERGM specification  allows us to model Simmelian statistics (i.e., a process of  formation of super-strong ties). Hence, this approach is directly  applicable for exploring hypothetical network processes that could  explain the evolution of the observed cross-sectional network [8,  23].   As a generalization of p1 models and Markov graphs [38],  exponential random graph models for social networks, also known  as p* models, were introduced by Frank and Strauss [39] and  Wasserman and Pattison [40]. ERGMs belong to the family of  probability models for network analysis that allow for more  generalizable inferences over the structural foundations of social  behavioral patterns [23, 38]. Observing network ties as random  variables, ERGMs allow for modeling overall network structure  through a set of local network processes [38]. ERGMs assume  that each tie within these local network processes (e.g., mutuality,  transitivity or triad closure) is conditionally dependent, indicating  further that empirical network ties do not form at random, but  that they self-organize into various patterns arising from  underlying social processes [41, p. 3]. Although ERGMs, and  similar statistical methods (e.g., longitudinal probabilistic social  network analysis  [4]), have been successfully applied in social  sciences [42], medical research [43] and studying traditional  education [8], their application in the context of online learning  and MOOCs is rather sparse.  From the perspective of the analytical methods applied and the  educational context analyzed, Kellogg et al.s [5] study is perhaps  the most relevant for our research. In their mixed methods study,  Kellogg and colleagues [5] aimed at providing more  comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes that  underlie peer support learning in MOOCs tailored towards  educators in K-12 settings. The quantitative part of the study  included application of SNA tools and techniques  descriptive  network measures and ERGMs  in the analysis of the two  interaction networks obtained from discussion forums. In order to  examine mechanisms of peer support in the two MOOCs, Kellogg  and colleagues [5] analyzed various patterns of selective mixing  and network statistics: reciprocity, homophily by professional role  (e.g., principal), gender, educational background, grade levels,  differences in experience (i.e., heterophily), and three proximity  mechanisms based on the state or country, geographical region,  and group assignment. The results indicate a strong and  significant reciprocity effect, suggesting that students are more  likely to reply to a peer when there has been prior evidence of  reciprocity. Nevertheless, homophily and heterophily effects, as  well as proximity mechanisms differed across the networks  analyzed.   2.4 Research questions  The education literature suggests that researchers predominantly  rely on descriptive methods when applying SNA in online  learning settings. There is far less evidence of the research  accounting for network specific variables that could provide  contextual background for the interpretation of the underlying  processes. Given the inconsistencies in findings on the association  between social centrality and learning outcome, we aimed at  determining whether network social dynamics have an impact on  the predictive power of network structural position. We were  particularly interested to find out whether a network formed  around an online course is characterized by the propensity to form  Simmelian ties. We hypothesized that these super-strong  relationships could influence the potential benefits students derive  from occupying more central positions in the network. Thus, we  defined the following two research questions:       RQ1. Are there differences in the underlying processes that  determine network formation within social networks formed in  various online learning settings   RQ2. Is the propensity for forming Simmelian ties significantly  different than expected if ties were formed randomly  Eventual differences in the social dynamics that frame social  interactions within the two networks analyzed would provide a  valid context for the interpretation of the possible variances in the  predictive power of the social centrality measures. Therefore, we  defined our third research question as follows:  RQ3. If there are differences in regularities that frame network  structure among the course participants, how do these  discrepancies affect the association between social centrality and  academic performance   3. METHOD  3.1 Data  This study analyzed forum discussions within two instances of a  single course that were delivered on the Coursera platform in  Spring 2015. The two instances, Code Yourself!1 (CDY) and A  Programar!2 (APR), were designed to be identical with respect to  the content and teaching methods, with the only difference being  the delivery language, i.e., English in CDY and Spanish in APR.  The MOOC aimed to introduce young teenagers to computer  programming, while covering the basic topics in computational  thinking and software engineering. The content of this 5-week  course consisted of lecture videos, quizzes and peer-assessed  programming projects, which were translated and tailored for  English and Spanish-speaking audiences. A common marking  scheme was established, whereby students were deemed to have  successfully completed the course (and obtained a certificate)  when they had a score of at least 50% for the coursework. A  distinction was awarded for students receiving a score of 75% or  more. CDY and APR were designed to be identical not only in  content, but also with respect to their simultaneous delivery with  the MOOCs running from March-April 2015. This implies that all  aspects of the MOOCs were equivalent including weekly course  announcements and matching instructor-initiated prompts in the  discussion forums, and adopting a common strategy for minimal  instructor intervention in the forums.                                                                     1 https://www.coursera.org/learn/codeyourself  2 https://www.coursera.org/learn/a-programar     Despite the common approach for the two course instances,  student engagement and performance was considerably different  in CDY and APR. As shown in Table 1, almost 60,000 students  enrolled in CDY and more than 25,000 in APR. However, almost  the same number of students completed the two courses  1,597 in  CDY and 1,595 in APR. Moreover, regardless the smaller student  cohort (in overall), higher number of students engaged with the  forum discussions in the APR course, resulting in a more  intensive forum activity produced (Table 1).   Table 1: Descriptive statistics for the number of enrolled  students, students engaged with the course content and   discussion forum, as well as the obtained certificates    CDY APR  Enrolled 59,531 25,255  Engaged 26,568 13,808  Engaged with forum 1,430 1,818  Posted messages   Threads 776 (1.69; 1.75) 1,081 (3.53; 5.12)  Posts 4,204 (3.13; 7.75) 5,940 (3.53; 5.12)   Comments 1,981 (3.42; 9.06) 2,686 (3.21; 6.75)  Total 5,177 7,409   Obtained certificate  Normal 586 644  Distinct 1,011 951   Total 1,597 1,595  Note: Thread, Posts and Comments rows display counts in the following   format  total (average; SD)     Figure 1: Proportion of students that watched a lecture each   week     Figure 2: Proportion of students browsing forums each week   Large differences were also observed with respect to student  engagement with the course materials. The proportion of students  that visited the course, watched a lecture, submitted an exercise or  browsed the forums each week in CDY was always smaller than  the corresponding proportion for APR that week. As depicted in   Figure 1 and Figure 2, in some cases this difference reached levels  of about 8%. It is also worth mentioning that the weekly  engagement steadily dropped in CDY during the 5-week duration.  In contrast for APR there was a steady drop during the first 4  weeks, followed by an increase in engagement for the final week.   3.2 Analysis  3.2.1 Social Network Analysis  To address the first two research questions, we extracted two  directed weighted graphs to represent interactions occurring  within discussion forums for the two course instances (CDY and  APR). Although several approaches have been proposed for  extracting social networks from discussion forums, we relied on  the most commonly applied approach that considers each message  as being directed to the previous one [11, 44]. For example, if  author A2 replied to a message posted by author A1, we would  add a directed edge A2->A1. Further, if A3 posted a comment on  A2s post, we would include A3->A2 edge as well. Finally, social  graph included all the students who posted to the discussion  forum.  Social network analysis was conducted through two  complementary phases; statistical network analysis and structural  (i.e., traditional) network analysis. The statistical network  analysis was performed using ERGMs in order to reveal various  networks statistics and examine processes that guided network  formation for both of the courses instances. Relying on commonly  used network statistics [4, 5, 8] we examined network formation  mechanisms at the two levels; dyadic and triadic. At the dyadic  level, we aimed to investigate the effects of selective mixing,  reciprocity, popularity, and expansiveness. Selective mixing  reflects a students propensity to interact with their peers based on  the combination of their individual characteristics [8, 23]. Thus,  we considered a homophily effect with respect to the following  students attributes:  - Achievement: none, normal, and distinct;  - Domestic: a student was from either the United Kingdom or   Uruguay (as the course was offered by two universities from  these two countries) or was from an alternate country;,   - Gender: male, female;   - Access group: student, instructor, or teaching staff.  Reciprocity, on the other hand, is a network statistic that models  students tendency to form mutual ties and cluster together [23].  In the case of our study, this property would allow for revealing  whether students tend to continue interaction with their peers who  replied to their posts. Finally, popularity and expansiveness tend  to model processes that would indicate the existence of students  who receive a significant number of replies to their posts or  students who tend to reply more often to their peers posts,  respectively.  At the triadic level, we examined effects of triadic closure and  Simmelian ties formation. Existing research argues that cyclic  and transitive triples are the common characteristics of networks  emerging from social media [45]. However, with directed  networks, these two statistics are captured within the triangle term  [8, 23]. Nevertheless, models with triangle term are almost always  degenerate [23], therefore, geometrically weighted edgewise  shared partner distribution (gwesp) is used instead. We also  modeled Simmelian ties [32] in order to examine whether the  network(s) analyzed conform to the Simmelian ties theory. That  is, whether the networks exhibit a formation of cliques of students  that tend to interact with each other significantly more often than     with the rest of their peers. Such a statistic could indicate that  those students are primarily being focused on their field of interest  and rarely interacting with other students.  The analysis of network structural properties relied on most  commonly used SNA measures that capture various aspects of  graph structural centrality  degree, closeness, and betweenness  centrality [9, 10, 34]. Degree centrality is considered the most  straightforward centrality measure, focusing on the local structure  surrounding the node and indicating the number of connections  (ties) a node has in the network [9]. It is commonly interpreted as  a measure of popularity [34] or the extent to which observed node  has a potential for activity in communication [9, p. 219]. Given  that our focus was on the analysis of weighted networks, we relied  on the weighted degree centrality, that accounts for the weight of  edges a node has in the network [46]. Closeness centrality  measures a distance of a given node to all other nodes in the  network [9]. Closeness centrality measures nodes potential to  connect easily with other nodes. Finally, betweenness centrality is  perhaps the most significant for the context of our study, given  Krackhardts [16] view on the association between the strength of  the ties and expected benefits for the nodes that bridge two  distinct parts of the network.   We consider three models, for each of the networks, based on the  described set of statistics  a demographic attribute model (DM)  that includes only processes based on students characteristics;  triadic closure and Simmelian ties model (TSM), including only  gwesp and simmelian statistics; and a full model that combines the  two (FM). Comparing likelihood-based measure of AICc, we  further continued selecting the most parsimonious model, which  would provide the best fit to our data. The social networks were  analyzed using the ergm 3.1.2 [47], an R package for statistical  network analysis, and using igraph 0.7.1 [7], a comprehensive R  software package for complex social network analysis research.   3.2.2 Regression Analysis  To examine the association between the dependent variable (i.e.,  obtained certificate), and the independent variables (i.e., three  centrality measures), we adopted multinomial logistic regression  (MLR) analysis [48], in order to answer our third research  question. MLR is predictive analysis that is used to explain the  association between a nominal dependent variable that has more  than two levels (none, normal, and distinct), and one or more  continuous independent variables [48]. It does not make any  assumptions of normality, linearity and homogeneity of variance  for the independent variables [48].  Aiming to observe the association between the three centrality  measures  degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality  and  the course outcome, we build three MLR models. Each model  included one dependent (obtained certificate) and one  independent variable (degree, closeness, or betweenness  centrality). The analyses were performed using the mlogit 0.2-4  package for R that enables estimation of multinomial logit models  [49].   4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  4.1 Network Characteristics  Descriptive statistics (Table 2) indicate rather diverse processes  within the two networks analyzed. Given the difference in the  number of nodes (Table 2) it is expected that the APR network  would have a considerably higher number of edges, and perhaps  moderately higher weighted degree. However, higher modularity,  average clustering coefficient and higher number of connected   components, could indicate a less cohesive group of students  within the CDY instance of the course [1]. Moreover, descriptive  statistics also indicate a comparable number of reciprocal ties,  whereas the number of super-strong ties is considerably higher  in case of the English version of the course.

Estimated  coefficients are presented in Table 3, whereas goodness-of-fit  statistics indicate that models provide a satisfactory fit for the  data. It is also important to note that we aimed at assessing  homophily at the level of access groups (i.e., students, teachers,  teaching staff) and triad closure (gwesp) (Section 3.2.1).  However, those two statistics indicated an overall worse fit to our  data than the selected (i.e., best fit) model; therefore, both  statistics were excluded from the final models analyzed.

It is revealing that differential homophily for the final course  outcome (i.e., obtained certificate) shows that both networks  exhibited a higher likelihood of assortative mixing between the  students who obtained the certificate. Similar to Kellogg and  colleagues study [5], our results suggest that the more successful  students tend to interact more often. However, the likelihood of  interaction between the most successful students is higher in the  CDY course. Whereas, the same effect holds between the students  who did not obtain the certificate in case of the English instance  of the course (although with less likelihood), the effect is negative  in the Spanish version of the course. Students who did not obtain     a certificate in the APR instance of the course were less likely to  interact with each other.  Homophily for the students country of residence, revealed a  significant effect for the English instance of the course, whereas  the effect was not significant in the Spanish version. Kellogg and  colleagues [5] observed a similar effect - i.e., homophily by state  or country) and found a significant positive increase in the  likelihood that two students from the same state or country will  create a tie. In our study, however, we examined selective mixing  between domestic students. Given that two courses were  particularly designed for two diverse groups of students, we aimed  at investigating how that aspect would influence students  tendencies to connect with their peers. Our results revealed that  students, who are considered domestic in the CDY course  instance, were less likely to connect with their domestic peers.  Observing students demographic data, we could perhaps expect  the same effect within both models, given that similar numbers of  students (7% in CDY and 10% in APR) were considered domestic  in both networks. However, the observed effect was not  statistically significant for the Spanish version of the course.  The effect of reciprocity was significant for the models of both  networks, indicating that students tended to continue interacting  with peers who replied to their posts. Although the estimates seem  rather high, those values are in line with results of Lusher,  Koskinen, and Robins [50] and Kellogg et al. [5] studies, who  also revealed a very strong effect of direct interaction between  students. It appears that a strong effect of reciprocity could be  seen as one of the defining characteristics of interaction in online  social networks in general [50]. Moreover, Lusher and colleagues  [50] further identified such networks as self-disclosing (p.249)  and bonding (p.249), characterized by strong ties relations  between the nodes. In such networks, students tend to self- disclose themselves, bonding with their peers, creating  comfortable environment for knowledge sharing and learning  [50]. However, given rather the low cohesion at the network level  for both networks (i.e., low density  Table 2), it seems  reasonable to conclude that students commonly interact within  smaller groups of peer students [24].   The effect of Simmelian ties was not consistent across both the  networks. While it was strong and significant for the CDY  network, in the case of the APR course we were not able to fit the  model with Simmelian statistics. Thus, although the strong effect  for reciprocity could indicate existence of strong ties, it seems that  the ties within the English version of the course evolved to super- strong ties, as defined by [16, 22]. The existence of Simmelian  ties beyond the chance level is a significant defining characteristic  of the social network emerging from the CDY discussion forum.  These ties are structurally embedded within relatively small,  highly connected and cohesive groups, commonly referred to as  communities [45]. Interactions within those communities are  more often and qualitatively different from interactions with other  peer students. This finding could be further explained by a rich- club phenomenon (p.1), an analogy used by Vaquero and  Cebrian [7] to explain frequent and intense (p.1, ibid.)  interactions occurring within relatively small groups of students,  where students benefit greatly from these structural arrangements.  The effect of expansiveness was not significant in the APR social  networks. However, we were not able to fit the model to a  satisfactory quality using this network statistics in case of the  CDY network. On the other hand, the strong negative effect of  popularity in the CDY network is also in line with Kelloggs [5]  study. Kellogg et al. [5] and Lusher and colleagues [50] argue that   such an effect could indicate that all the students have a similar  level of popularity and that most likely networks were not  centralized on in-degree [5, p. 275]. Considering the previous  results (i.e., the strong effect of reciprocity) this result seems quite  intuitive. Moreover, given the fact that we observed interactions  within a discussion forum, this effect further contributes to the  understanding that students in both networks tended to engage  into further interaction with their peers, rather than simply posting  a message without the intent to contribute the further discussion.  In addressing the first and second research question, we were  able to conclude that the observed networks differ with respect to  the determinants of network formation. The most notable  difference is related to the structure of super-strong ties, where  CDY network exhibit a formation of cliques formed around  students who tend to interact within the strong and stable groups  of peers, which resist change [31, p. 21]. Although the APR  network showed the same regularities with respect to reciprocity  of interaction and popularity, the effect of Simmelian ties was not  present. Finally, the APR network also revealed higher tendency  that students would interact more often with higher performing  peers.   4.2 Social centrality and academic  achievement  Analyzing the association between the students centrality and the  final learning outcome further revealed differences between the  two networks. Specifically, in the case of the CDY course  instance, only weighted degree centrality was significantly  associated with the course outcome  2(1) = 9.048, p=.011.  However, multinomial regression analysis showed that an increase  in weighted degree significantly increased the likelihood of  obtaining certificate with distinction, compared to not completing  the course successfully, whereas there was no significant  difference between normal certificate and failing the course  (Table 4). On the other hand, closeness and betweenness  centrality were not significantly associated with the course  outcomes.  Table 4: Results of the multinomial regression analysis of the   association between social centrality and the final learning  outcome (i.e., obtained certificate)     Estimate SE t  Weighted Degree   CDY distinct  0.008* 0.004 2.720   normal 0.007 0.004 1.618   APR distinct  0.046*** 0.006 7.318   normal 0.046*** 0.006 7.413  Closeness   CDY distinct  0.002 0.038 0.046   normal 0.062 0.066 0.934   APR distinct  -0.064* 0.030 -2.113   normal -0.105** 0.037 -2.816  Betweenness   CDY distinct  0.000009 0.000005 1.621   normal -0.000003 0.00001 -0.185   APR  distinct 0.0001*** 0.00002 5.584  normal 0.0001*** 0.00002 5.562   Note: * p < .05. ** p < .01. *** p < .001; Reference levels for each of the  analysis was none  i.e., student did not obtain a certificate.   The APR social network revealed different patterns. All of the  observed centrality measures were significantly related to the  likelihood to obtain a certificate  weighted degree, 2(1) =     90.217, p<.001; closeness, 2(1) = 9.679, p=.008, and  betweenness, 2(1) = 59.832, p<.001. Even more so, an increase  in each of the centrality measures significantly increased the  likelihood of both  obtaining a certificate with distinction, and a  normal certificate (Table 4), compared to not completing the  course. It should be noted that direction of closeness centrality is  opposite to the betweenness and degree centrality  lower values  indicate lower distance (i.e., higher closeness) of a given node to  all other nodes in the network [10].  There are two important aspects of the findings presented in the  previous section. First, we would argue that our results support  [16, 22] understanding of the importance of social centrality in  providing greater opportunity for wellpositioned individuals.  Although Krackhardt [16, 22] discusses the potential to bridge  between two social groups (i.e., betweenness centrality), we  would posit that the importance of the most commonly addressed  centrality measures in educational research  degree (to a certain  extent), closeness, and betweenness  should be interpreted with  respect to the propensity to form Simmelian ties. Following  Krackhardts [16] argument that occupying a bridging role can  be more constraining (p. 184, ibid.), our results show that  depending on the given context, a higher social centrality does not  necessarily imply a better academic performance. In that sense, we  could conclude that those students who are occupying positions  between strongly connected groups of students might not be able  to benefit significantly from their position. Observed from the  perspective of roles, as defined by Krackhardt [16], this finding  could further indicate that students within the CDY course  instance tended to primarily interact with peers who share the  same interests, and perhaps have the same or similar level of  knowledge. Nevertheless, further research is needed to address  this assumption.  The second important finding of our results relates to the  development of an interactive rich-club [7]. In their analysis of  the relationship between the social structure and performance,  Vaquero and Cebrian [7] concluded that students tend to interact  within the groups of strongly connected peers. Vaquero and  Cebrian [7] labeled those groups as a rich-club, where students  engage in interaction with their peers at the very beginning of the  course, and tend to remain within the same cliques throughout the  course. Vaquero and Cebrian [7] further showed that those  persistent interactions are maintained between high performing  students, whereas low performing students would usually attempt  to join those groups later in the course. However, such attempts  would usually fail to produce reciprocity in the interaction with  high performing students. Thus, those rich-clubs or the groups  of strongly connected students could be easily connected with  Krackhardts [16] cliques (i.e., groups of students connected with  super-strong, Simmelian ties).  From the analysis of the two social networks it would appear that  interaction within the CDY discussion forum tended to follow the  social structure as noted in Vaquero and Cebrians [7] study. This  could imply that students within the APR course instance were  more socially inclusive, and supportive of their peers who may  have joined late in the discussions. On the other hand, it could  also mean that the majority of students in the APR course instance  were simply engaged in the discussions from the very beginning  of the course. Both of these possible interpretations require  further research to more comprehensively explain the reasons for  the observed differences in social interactions within two different  networks of students (i.e., student in CDY and APR course).  Nevertheless, it should be noted that we do not assume that those   students who attained a more central position in a social graph are  necessarily low performing students.   With respect to the third research question, our results support  the assumption that social centrality in networks that are formed  around strongly connected components (i.e., rich-club or  Simmelian groups, as with the CDY network) is not associated  with the final course outcome. Whereas, on the other hand, with  more relaxed interactions (i.e., the APR network), however still  assuming a high level of reciprocity in social ties, social centrality  is significantly and positively associated with the course outcome  (i.e., obtained certificate). Finally, it should be noted that  weighted degree centrality diverges from this pattern to a certain  extent (Table 4).     5. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS  This study investigated the importance of the context that defines  students social interactions for the association between structural  centrality and learning outcome. Primarily, we grounded the  theoretical framework in Simmels theory of social interactions  and Krackhardts [16] argument that the quality of tie itself  interacts with the bridging role to produce more constraint on the  unsuspecting actor (p.184), to define network specific properties  that would allow us to make more valid inferences. Finally,  supplementing descriptive SNA with statistical network analysis  and multinomial logistic regression, we were able to conclude that  social centrality within the network characterized with super- strong ties, does not necessarily imply benefits. On the other  hand, structural centrality in the network with reciprocal ties,  where all participants have similar level of popularity, yet without  a significant effect of super-strong ties, is positively associated  with the likelihood of obtaining a certificate at the end of the  course.    Analyzing roles in an organization, Krackhardt [16] concluded  that traditional role analysis on raw network relations (p. 208),  should be supplemented with the Simmelian ties analysis, arguing  further that such an analysis provides more insight into  organizational phenomena (p.208). Our study extends  Krackhardts [16] argument in two directions. Primarily, we argue  that any traditional SNA (not just role analysis), should be  supported with the Simmelian ties analysis, as those ties are  qualitatively different from weak and strong ties as defined by  Granovetter [13], and therefore provide a more comprehensive  understanding of social interactions and the dynamics influencing  the overall network. Moreover, as a consequence of this  theoretical recommendation, it is reasonable to argue that  traditional (primarily descriptive) approaches to the analysis of  social interactions should be supported by statistical network  analysis. Relying solely on mathematical approaches we are able  to identify the most significant patterns in the established social  interactions. However, in order to understand which of the  identified patterns significantly determine network structure and  occur beyond the chance, more profound (statistical) models are  required [8, 23, 47].   Through the statistical network analysis methods, we were able to  provide context to interpret an association between social  centrality and academic achievement. Again we refer to the  previous work by Krackhardt [16, 22, 31] to explain how  Simmelian ties could affect ones position within an organization.  Krackhardt [16] identified those super-strong ties as more  enduring, more visible, and more critical than sole-symmetric  ties (p.208), that is, ties that constrain and influence (ibid.).      One of the imposed connotations of our findings, for both  research and practice domains, is the necessity to account for  contextual information when interpreting the potential gains  implied by the network structural properties. For example,  revealing and visualizing network structure using deeply  embedded relations (i.e., Simmelian backbones) [45] could  significantly improve the quality of information presented in  social learning analytics dashboards, such as the one presented in  the work by Schreurs and colleagues [20]. Moreover, providing  additional information about the social dynamics should  supplement any feedback based on the measures of structural  centrality. Likewise, research on predicting association between  descriptive network measures and products of learning, in  educational settings, should be constructed on valid theoretical  assumptions that could support conclusions about inferred social  dynamics.   Further research should also integrate temporal dynamics to  investigate how certain network processes evolve over time. A  promising approach in that direction would be application of  Temporal ERGMs [51], or similar models, for studying time- evolving social networks. Moreover, as indicated by Edwards [42]  and Kellogg and colleagues [5], as well as in our previous work  [11], [52], SNA should be integrated with content analysis to  account for the quality of students contribution. Finally, it should  be noted that 39% of CDY students who submitted the survey,  stated that English was their first language. On the other hand,  97% of student who participated in APR course and submitted the  survey chose Spanish as their first language. However, we were  not able to include this information in the model, since majority of  students who participated in the course did not submit the survey.  This also reflected to the students who participated in the  discussion forum. Nevertheless, investigating whether language,  as a predominate medium for communication between students in  a computer-mediated learning environment [52], influences  development of the underlying social processes, presents a  promising venue for future research.   Several limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. We  analyzed students interactions within discussion forum in two  instances of a same MOOC. Although we relied on a most  commonly accepted method for network construction, this  approach tends to underestimate the intensity of all the  interactions within the given settings. Moreover, analysis of  interactions in a more informal settings, such as connectivist  MOOC [53], would also contribute to the greater generalizability  of our findings. Finally, data from different subject domains (e.g.,  social science) should be analyzed in order to account for diverse  learning settings.   6.
