With more than ten thousand questions in both English and Chinese,  the system has attracted nearly five thousand learners who have  made about half a million question answering records. In an effort  towards delivering personalized learning experience to the learners,   this study aims to discover potentially useful knowledge from  learners reading and question answering records in the Reading  Battle system, by applying association rule mining and clustering  analysis. The results show that learners could be grouped into three  clusters based on their self-reported reading habits. The rules mined   from different learner clusters can be used to develop personalized  recommendations to the learners. Implications of the results on  evaluating and further improving the Reading Battle system are also  discussed.

INTRODUCTION  Reading proficiency is fundamental for students as it is closely  associated with their learning abilities and academic performance  [2]. It is widely recognized that the advancement of reading abilities  is essential to primary-school students as it facilitates their   understanding of academic materials and tasks [1], [2]. As a result,  students with higher reading proficiency tend to perform better in  academic activities [1], [2].    Reading Battle (http://battle.cite.hku.hk/) is an online e-quiz system  designed to develop primary-school students reading interests and  enhance their reading proficiency [2]. Launched in 2014, Reading   Battle has included over 500 English and Chinese books available in  local school libraries, as well as more than 10,500 well-tailored  questions related to these books. The books are categorized into a   23-category taxonomy (e.g., fiction or folklore), in English and  Chinese (see Table 4). Each question in the system is also encoded  with a question category (ranging from information search,  interpretation and synthesis, inference to evaluation) and a  difficulty level (ranging from level 1 to level 4). The materials are  cataloged and developed by reading literacy experts including  language teachers and school librarians, with the guidance of the  international PIRLS assessment framework on childrens reading  literacy [2].    After reading a book registered to the system, a student can log in to  the Reading Battle system and take a quiz corresponding to that  book. Around 30 questions are designed for each book and each  time the system randomly selects 10 questions to form a quiz for the   student. The questions in Reading Battle are in the same language  (English or Chinese) as that of the books they are associated with.  The bilingual setting is uniquely designed, following the policy of  two written languages and three spoken codes in Hong Kong. To  date, the Reading Battle system has attracted over 30 primary  schools in Hong Kong and Taiwan, a public library summer  program and a kindergarten in the U.S., with a total of over four  thousand student users.   A significant trend in the education field is to deliver personalized  learning experience to the learners. There has been strong empirical  evidence on the positive effects of personalized learning on  academic performance and learning effectiveness [3]. As there are   different categories of books and questions, and students interests  and abilities vary, it would be more effective if the system can  provide personalized learning experience by recommending books a  student likes and questions that fit his or her abilities.   This study thus aims to discover potentially useful knowledge from  reading and question answering records of primary-school students  enrolled in Reading Battle. The analysis results will be used to  improve the system design and develop personalized   recommendations of books and questions to learners. As our first  attempt along this direction, this paper aims to answer the following  research questions:    1) What kinds of books and questions have the students read and  answered   2) Are there interesting association rules among the books the  students read   3) Are there interesting association rules among the questions the  students answered      Answers to the first question help develop overall understanding of  the usage patterns of books and questions since the launch of     Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not  made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear  this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The examination of association rules on the book  level will reveal potentially preferable reading orders. An  association rule on the book level would be like if a student reads  book X (or books in category A), he/she is likely to read book Y (or  books in category B). Such rules can be readily used to make book  recommendations to students based on their reading records.    The examination of association rules on the question level will   provide insights on the question design. If a student answers  questions in category A (or level X) correctly, association rule  mining will help find out whether this student is likely to answer  questions in category B (or level Y) correctly. Such rules will help   indicate whether the design of question categories and difficulty  levels is suitable for the student users. Suggestions for system  improvement can be made based on the indications. Furthermore,  the results can be used to generate personalized question sets to   accommodate individual students abilities.    By analyzing learners question answering records in Reading  Battle, this study helps develop a comprehensive understanding on  how primary-school students use an e-quiz bank for reading,   particularly a bilingual system such as Reading Battle. It also  provides evidence on how well the system is serving the student  users, based on what suggestions for further improvement of the  system can be proposed. Furthermore, the rules mined from   learners records can be used to deliver personalized book  recommendations and question selection, which will likely be a  significant enhancement to the learning experience. Overall, the  study is expected to provide empirical evidence on how learning   analytics can be applied to enhance the understanding of learners  and improve the learning environment.    2. METHODS  2.1 Association Rule Mining and Clustering  Association rule mining and clustering are common data mining  methods used to analyze user data from learning systems [6].   Association rule mining is used to explore the relationships between  items in a large dataset. It helps discover rules in the form of  premise  conclusion which stands for if the premise occurs in  the dataset, the conclusion is likely to occur as well. Such rules are  very useful for disclosing relationships between items in a dataset.   Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm is used for  association rule mining in this study, for its efficiency and clarity as  implemented in the RapidMiner toolkit [5]. Whether a resultant rule  is sufficiently strong or interesting is decided by a series of   measures. In this study, we follow the suggestions from Merceron  and Yacef [7] on rule mining in the education domain, and employ  the Cosine and Lift measures of interestingness to evaluate rules  output by the algorithm, with the minimum Cosine threshold set as   0.65 and the minimum Lift as 1.10 [7]. Considering both measures  helps ensure the retained rules are meaningful and interesting.  Clustering is a data mining technique for discovering proximity  patterns in a given dataset [4]. Data samples are separated into   different groups such that a high similarity is expected within groups  while different groups should be able to differentiate themselves  from each other. Agglomerative clustering algorithm is adopted in  this study for its deterministic nature and flexibility in deriving the   number of resultant clusters.   2.2 Data Collection and Analysis  The data analyzed in this study is a snapshot of the Reading System  taken in May 2015. There were a total of 3,175 students producing  26,189 book reading records and 457,235 question answering   records in Reading Battle as of May 12, 2015. Among these active  users, 523 of them responded to an online questionnaire about their   reading behaviors, preferences and attitudes towards reading. As this  group of learners and their parents have given consent to the project  team to analyze the data, in this study we extracted and analyzed the   119,377 system records of these learners. Two sets of user data were  extracted from the system: 1) students reading records, each  including book title, unique ID of the books, book category and  language; 2) students quiz records, each of which includes the  question, question answer, question category and difficulty level.  Clustering was applied to group the students into clusters based on  their questionnaire answers. Association rule mining was applied to  analyze the data on four levels: 1) book category; 2) individual   book; 3) question difficulty level; and 4) question category.    3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  3.1 Student Clusters  A total 523 responses were received for the online survey and the  demographic information is summarized in Table 1. All but five of  the students were primary students ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 6.   The majority of them were in Grade 5, accounting for 67.4% of the  students considered in this study.   Table 1: Student demographics     Characteristics N %   Gender   Male 270   51.6   Female 253   48.4   Total 523 100.0   Grade   P1     3     0.6   P2    15     2.9   P3    56   10.8   P4    81   15.6   P5 349   67.4   P6   14     2.7   Missing     5     1.0   Total 523 100.0          Figure 1: Centroid plot of three clusters   Cluster analysis was carried out to group the students into clusters  based on their responses to 12 questions related to reading habits,  including hours and frequencies of reading various kinds of books,  as well as hours of watching TV and playing games. The     agglomerative clustering results showed three major clusters and  thus three clusters were formed. The normalized values of the  cluster centroids are presented in Figure 1. Cluster 1 (n=91) consists   of students with long reading hours and a high reading frequencies,  and thus it is identified as the cluster with good reading habits.  Cluster 3 (n=124) with short reading hours and low reading  frequencies is identified as the cluster with bad reading habits.  Cluster 2 (n=308) lies in between the other two clusters, with middle  values of reading time and reading frequencies. It is thus identified  as the cluster with moderate reading habits.    Association rule mining was then applied to mine interesting rules   from the reading and question answering records among all students  and students in each cluster. Table 2 provides an overview of the  interesting and non-redundant rules for each student group on the  book and question levels.    Table 2: Numbers of interesting and non-redundant association  rules for each student cluster    Book  category   Individual  book   Question  category   Question  level   All students   1   0 19 29  Cluster 1 46 16 43 77  Cluster 2 11   4 12 24  Cluster 3   2   0 15 20   3.2 Book-level Rules  3.2.1 Book Category  Twenty three book categories were defined for English and Chinese  books in the Reading Battle. Table 3 presents the number of book in   each category and how many times each category has been read.  Picture book and fiction were among the most popular categories in  both languages. In addition, English fantasy, Chinese fairytale and  Chinese science book were also read quite frequently.    Table 3: Book categories   Book category  English Book Chinese book   Number  Times   being read  Number   Times being  read   Biography     2   19     7     63   Detective story     2   15     9   137  Fable     7 101     1    36   Fairytale     9   71   26   283  Fantasy   38 114     2     18   Fiction   30 124   60   285  Folklore     6   28   21   227   Nonfiction   16   35   23     80  Picture book   57 163   17   221   Science   14   73   34   299  Science &   picture book      1   25     0      0   Fantasy &   picture book      0     0     1      43   History     0     0     4    104   Total 182 768 205 1,796   Based on the criteria described in Section 2.1, only one interesting  rules was mined among all 523 students considered in our study. A  closer look at candidate rules discloses their low Support values,  which means most of the students read books in different categories.   However, the Support values of candidate rules increase when  student clusters are considered separately. This indicates students  with similar reading habits (in the same cluster) tended to read  books in the same categories more often than students with different   reading habits (in different clusters). Table 4 shows all the   interesting rules mined on book categories in records of students in  Cluster 2 (moderate reading habits), two of which are also found  among those mined from Cluster 3 (bad habits). In fact, Cluster 3  has very few interesting rules (n=2), probably due to the fact that  those students did not read much and thus had few records in the  system. Most of the rules in Table 4 are also included in rules mined  from Cluster 1 (good habits) which in fact has much more rules  (n=46) that cannot be enumerated in Table 4. In addition, Cluster 1  is the only cluster with rules involving English book categories. Not  surprisingly, this is because students in this cluster read a lot and  produced many records in the system. Table 5 presents a sample of   interesting rules mined from Cluster 1 and their measures.    Table 4: Interesting and non-redundant rules on book categories  for student clusters   No. Premises Conclusion Cluster 1  Cluster   2  Cluster   3   1 (fairytale)    (folklore)     -   2  (fiction)   (fairytale),    (science)    -   3  (folklore)   (fairytale),    (science)    -   4  (folklore)   (fairytale),    (fiction)    -   5   (fairytale),     (science)    (fiction),     (folklore)   -  -   6  (fairytale)   (science),    (fiction)    -   7  (science)    (picture book)     -   8     (picture book)    (science)   -   9  (fiction)    (folklore)     -   10  (science)   (fairytale),    (fiction)    -   11  (science)    (folklore)   -  -   12  (fairytale)  (fiction)     13  (fiction)  (fairytale)      Recommendations can be made based on the rules for each cluster.  For example, if a student with good or moderately good reading  habits (Cluster 1 or 2) has read a Chinese fairytale, he/she is likely   to read a Chinese folklore (Rule #1 in Table 4). Next time when  he/she logs in to the system, a recommendation list of Chinese  folklores can be presented on his/her homepage. In the case of  Cluster 3 (bad habits), after exhausting the two rules of its own (i.e.  recommending Chinese fiction to students who have read Chinese  fairytale and vice versa), rules from Cluster 2 (moderate habits) can  be borrowed and applied to the students in Cluster 3 (bad habits).  The premise of this rule borrowing strategy lies in that rules in a  student cluster with better reading habits can be beneficial to  students in another cluster with worse reading habits, and that rules  in one cluster can largely be acceptable by students in an adjacent  cluster. Similarly, when rules in Cluster 2 (moderate habits) have all  been applied to a student in Cluster 2, rules in Cluster 1 (good  habits) can be applied to this student. As there are more rules in  clusters with better reading habits, this strategy can help mitigate the  potential problem of rule deficiency. Of course, the effectiveness of  the strategy needs to be evaluated with students, which will be   conducted in our future work.      Table 5: Sample of interesting rules on book categories for students with good reading habits (Cluster 1)  Premises Conclusion Support Confidence Lift Cosine  Fable (fiction) ,(fairytale), picture book, fiction 0.21 0.76 2.93 0.78  Fable (science), picture book 0.21 0.76 2.67 0.74   Fable (fiction), (picture book), (fairytale) 0.21 0.76 2.10 0.66   Fiction (fiction), (fairytale), (folklore), picture book 0.22 0.59 2.38 0.72    (picture book) ,   (fairytale), fiction  (folklore), picture book 0.21 0.76 2.44 0.71           3.2.2 Individual Book  A total of 387 books were read by the students, among which 362  books were read more than one time. No interesting rules are  discovered in the entire student population or among the students   in Cluster 3. A few interesting and non-redundant rules are mined  for Cluster 2 (n=4) and Cluster 1 (n=16). The reason for the small  number of rules is that there are many individual books in the  system and reading records of individual books are sparse.   Limited recommendations of individual books can be made based  on the rules from these student clusters. Cluster 3 can then borrow  the rules from the other two clusters considering that the other two  clusters have better reading habits and more interesting rules.   More reading records are needed to establish interesting and  strong rules on the individual book level.    3.3 Question-level Rules  There were 4,436 and 5, 968 English and Chinese questions that  have been answered by the students respectively. Their  distribution across difficulty levels and categories is shown in   Table 6. As in books, there were more Chinese questions  answered than English ones in all difficulty levels and categories  except for Evaluation.    Table 6: Question difficulty level and category   English   Questions  Chinese   Questions  Difficulty level  Level 1 1,540 1,577   Level 2 1,439 1,756  Level 3 648 1,461  Level 4 809 1,174   Total 4,436 5,968   Category  Information search (infn) 2,184 2,139  Interpretation & synthesis (inte) 781 2,036   Inference (infer) 901 1,386  Evaluation (eva) 570    407   Total 4,436 5,968   Interesting association rules mined from all students are listed in  Table 7, Rule 1 to 16 on question difficulty levels and Rule 17 to  27 on question categories. It is not surprising that answering  questions of higher difficulty levels correctly would imply   answering those of lower difficulty levels correctly, for both  English and Chinese questions (Rule #4, 8, 9 10, 11, 12).  However, among Chinese questions, quite a few rules also  indicate the opposite: answering questions of lower difficulty   levels correctly could imply answering those of higher difficulty  levels correctly (Rule # 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7). The high Support and  Confidence values of Rule #1 and #2 indicate these cases occurred  quite often. In contrast, rules of English questions seem to follow   the difficulty levels well. No rules with correct answers in lower  difficulty levels alone imply correct answers in higher difficulty  levels. This seems to indicate that the difficulty levels of English   questions are better scaled and more suitable for the student users  in consideration. For Chinese questions, Rule #1 and #3 are  symmetric (i.e., answering Level 1 questions correctly implies   answering Level 2 questions correctly, and vice versa), so are  Rule #2 and #3. These rules show that, to this group of students,  the difficulty levels of Chinese questions in Level 1 and Level 2,  and those in Level 1 and Level 3 may not be clearly  distinguishable. One possible reason is that Chinese questions of   Level 1-3 are relatively easy for this group of student users. A  closer look at the rules from student clusters further verifies this  conjecture: all three clusters contain rules like Rule # 1 and 2, as   well as [level_2_Chi_r]  [level_3_Chi_r]. Therefore, it can be  suggested to the Reading Battle system to increase the difficulty  degree of Level 2 and Level 3 Chinese questions, so that they   would be more challenging to the students.    The case is a little different for Level 4 Chinese questions. To  have the conclusion of answering Level 4 Chinese questions   correctly, the premise clauses have to include correctly answering  questions in two other levels at the same time, i.e. Level 1 and  Level 2 questions (Rule #5), Level 1 and Level 3 questions (Rule  #6), or Level 2 and Level 3 questions (Rule #7). These rules   indicate that Level 4 Chinese questions are indeed more  demanding than those in other levels. Rule #14 to #16 reveal  associations among questions across languages. It seems that  correctly answering questions in a higher difficulty level in one   language could help boost the chance of correctly answering  questions in a lower difficulty level in the other language.  However, this needs to be verified when more data are collected  and more rules can be mined.   For question categories, Rule #17 and #18 indicate if students  answered Evaluation Chinese questions correctly, they would  likely to answer all other three kinds of Chinese questions   correctly. For these students, it is recommended that they proceed  to a higher difficulty level in Chinese questions in order to keep  them challenged and continuing improving their abilities. For  English questions, Rule #24 to #26 indicate if students correctly   answered any other kind of English questions than Information  search, they would correctly answer English questions in  Information search category. These results are in accordance  with the common knowledge that Evaluation questions are of a  higher complexity than others and Information search questions  are more straightforward than others. Rule #19 to #21 reveal two  symmetric pairs: (infer_Chi_r, infn_Chi_r) and (infer_Chi_r,  inte_Chi_r). Another symmetric pair between (infn_Chi_r,   inte_Chi_r) is revealed by Rule # 22 and 23. These pairs are also  found in each of the three student clusters. They suggest that the  complexity levels of Chinese questions in these three categories  (infn, inte, and infer) are mostly comparable, to the students   considered in this study. Again, similar to difficulty levels, the  results suggest that Reading Battle probably should adjust the  complexity of Chinese questions in these three categories, so that  they can be more useful in differentiating students abilities in  information search, interpretation & synthesis and inference.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  The study explores the associations among books and questions   in an e-quiz system, Reading Battle, which supports primary- school students in improving their reading interests and  proficiency. Clustering and association rule mining techniques  were used to analyze user records extracted from the system.   The resultant association rules can be used to improve the  question design and develop personalized recommendations to  student users. The results also help further deepen our  understanding of students usage of the Reading Battle system,  which in turn provides rationales for further improvement. As   the system continues to run, more user data will be collected in  the future. The expansion of record size for each student will not  only enlarge the scale of association rules but also help improve  the strength and confidence of the rules. Besides, participation in   the online survey of reading habits should also be encouraged in  the future, so that more students can be grouped into clusters and  cluster-based recommendations could be made available to  them. In addition, the online survey provides an opportunity to   collect relevant data for building up user profiles based on which  more rules for recommendation can be explored.   This study strives to provide empirical evidence that learning  analytics can be applied to mine valuable knowledge from   student interaction with online learning system and facilitate the  development of personalized learning, particularly for an online  reading platform for primary-school students. It contributes to  the literature on the development of personalization in online   reading platforms. As the next step, we will implement the rules  identified in this study into the recommender system in Reading  Battle and evaluate their effectiveness with real users.
