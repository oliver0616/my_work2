This is the first MOOC, to our knowledge,  to capture valuable student affect data through self-reported  surveys. To collect student affect, we used two self-reporting  methods: (1) The Self-Assessment Manikin and (2) A discrete  emotion list. We found that the most common reported MOOC  emotion was Hope followed by Enjoyment and Contentment.  There were substantial shifts in affective states over the course,  notably with Anxiety and Pride. The most valuable result of our  study is a preliminary description of the methods for collecting  self-reported student affect at scale in a MOOC setting.

INTRODUCTION   Despite the burst of research focused on educational data  generated by MOOCs, little work has been done on student affect  in MOOCs. This is surprising given that previous research has  demonstrated that student affect is a critical part of the learning  process [1,7]. Although a few previous papers have considered  emotions in a MOOC context [5,8], this paper reports the first  broad study of self-reported student affect in a MOOC context.  This study is based on the University of Notre Dames  introductory statistics MOOC called I Heart Stats. Previous and  extensive research has focused on anxiety during learning  Statistics [6]. One of the learning objectives of this course was to  alleviate student anxiety towards Statistics, and in this regard, it  was an ideal opportunity to investigate affect.   2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS  Unlike previous research, which has inferred student affect based  on discussion fora [8] or click behavior [5], in this study, we  directly and periodically ask students to self-report affect.  Furthermore, we track a substantially greater number of affective  states than previous studies. We investigate three research  questions: Q1. What affective states do students experience in a  MOOC setting Q2. How do the reported affective states co- occur Q3. How do these affective states change over the  duration/modules of the course   3. SETUP AND DATA COLLECTION  There were 8 modules (or weeks) of content for I Heart Stats  and all of the content was released simultaneously. Total  enrollment was 24,279 from 183 different countries. The content  included short videos as well as multiple-choice assessments,  similar to many MOOCs. To measure student emotion in the  course we used two self-report assessments. The first (see Figure  1) was the Self-Assessment Manikins (SAM) [3] measure of  valence (i.e. negative to positive). Since English was not the first  language of a large portion of the enrolled students, SAM offered  a non-linguistic measure for valence. A second assessment (see  Figure 2) presented students with a list of 15 discrete emotions  and asked students to select two emotions that best described how  they were feeling. These two questions were asked at the start of  Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6, as well as at the end of Week 8.       Figure 1: Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM).     Figure 2: Emotion List.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS   Q1. What affective states do students experience in a MOOC  setting  Approximately 3,968 students completed the discrete emotion  response survey at least once. The most frequently reported  affective states (see Figure 3) were Hope, Enjoyment, and  Contentment.    Q2. How do the reported affective states co-occur   Table 1 lists the number of distinct emotion combinations for  each survey. Asking students to report two emotions affords an  analysis of co-occurring states [2]. For instance, the top five  emotion pairs from Week 0 (see Table 2) show that frequently  reported affective states such as Hope are often paired with  several different affective states. Further study, however, is  needed to determine the Lift scores of these co-occurring  emotions [2].    Table 1: Count of Emotion Combinations   Table 2: Top 5 Co-Occurring Emotion Pairs in Week 0        Q3. How do these affective states change over the  duration/modules of the course  Figure 4 presents the distribution of individual affective states  over the duration of the course. Note that Hope, Enjoyment, and  Contentment remained dominant positive affective states. Pride  increased as the course progressed, while Hope and Anxiety  decreased.      Figure 4: Distribution of Emotions Over Course.      5. CONCLUSION/FUTURE WORK   We collected affect data in a MOOC setting. We found that  Hope, Contentment, and Enjoyment are frequent and persistent  MOOC emotions. Previous research on affect and learning with   technology has largely overlooked some of these emotions,  especially Hope [4]. We have also found that the frequency of  certain emotions such as Anxiety, Relief, and Pride can change  substantially over a course. We acknowledge that our results may  be biased by the high rate of MOOC attrition. Once a student  drops out, we can no longer collect his or her self-reported  emotion. Further research to control for dropout bias in self- reporting affect surveys is needed.    We also plan to study the co-occurring affective states and  discrete states in conjunction with course log data. One practical  application of sensor-free affect detection in a MOOC context is  affect prediction and affect-based intervention. Detecting if a  student is confused or frustrated would allow designers,  instructors, and learning scientists to orchestrate personalized and  timely interventions at scale. An additional practical application  of this research is a better understanding of how students feel  about different types and samples of learning content. These  items will be pursued in future work in the context of I Heart  Stats and in other MOOCs as well.    6.
