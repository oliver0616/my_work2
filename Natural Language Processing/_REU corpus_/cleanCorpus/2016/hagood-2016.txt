The players real-world steps transform into in-game  resources needed for gameplay. In addition to requiring real-world  steps for various in-game activities, a dashboard in this game  presents visual representations of activity patterns, ostensibly  informing students about patterns of their own activity. In this paper  and poster, we discuss challenges in initial designs of our  dashboard. We present findings and challenges in the process of  creating a user-centered dashboard and conclude with our future  design goals.

INTRODUCTION  The far-reaching consequences of youth obesity and inactivity  compel contemplation of learning analytics role in supporting  healthier outcomes for youth. Since 1980 the adolescent obesity  rate has tripled, growing from 5% to 18% [1]. Youth need access  to information and resources to live healthier lives. The emerging  Quantified Self (QS) movement offers one approach to tracking  health data and exploring personal analytics [2].  A core assumption of quantified self approaches is that information  alone is inherently valuable and motivating. But, youth often fail to  find their data fascinating or useful [3]. We suggest that, by  leveraging the documented success of videogames to motivate  change, we can more successfully present health analytics [4];  incorporating dry activity data into a motivating game context to  promote behavior and awareness changes.   2. PROJECT CONTEXT  We combine our expertise of in learning analytics, health science,  and game development, to explore how game play which integrates  players own physical activity data can promote healthy awareness  and behavior.   This study spans multiple iterations of data collection with different  groups. For this paper we focus our discussion in the second year  of the project. By employing a working example methodology [5]  we discuss how our findings and design processincluding our  initial struggles to incorporate analytics meaningfully.   2.1 Study Overview  We provided youth at two school sites activity monitorsthe  commercially available Fitbit Zips. The participants wore these  activity monitors for 30 days and then played the game Terra while  continuing to use the activity monitors for another 63 days. Terra  is a tile-turning style game following the narrative of planetary  exploration and terraforming created by our research team and a  gamedesign firm. Throughout this time, we collected data from  focus groups, individual interviews, observations, activity  monitors, game servers, and publically-available site statistics.   2.2 Participants and Their Communities  Two school sites provide the second year case studies in this  project. Participants from Capitol Middle School included mainly  lower socioeconomic (SES) youth participating in an after school  program in a large urban area of Northern California (N = 40, Mage  = 12.6). Participants from Greenville Junior High included youth  enrolled an educational technology elective course from a well- resourced suburban community (N = 61, Mage = 13.7). Table 1  compares both school sites to each other and the overall state  demography.

DASHBOARDS FOR ACTIVITY DATA  In addition to leveraging game mechanics to promote behavior and  attitude changes relating to activity, our team developed a  dashboard that displays the activity history of the player outside of   Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work  for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that  copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial  advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the  first page.

These metrics track the students activity, which provides  in game bonuses and energy points. Here we discuss what we have  learned so far and present our current approach to creating a truly  user-centered dashboard.   3.1 User Experience: Im Confused  A main finding regarding the in-game dashboard  see one screen  shown in Figure 1  is that players seemed confused or  uninterested in our data representations. The initial dashboard  design used simplistic data representations like line graphs.  However, we found that students often needed help to decipher the  graphs, or did not make connections between what they saw on the  graphs and their everyday activities. In contrast when activity data  was transmuted and displayed as energy points for gameplay, the  students made sense of their activity data in the context of the game  narrative and considered their overall activity patterns.   While participants were not motivated to spend much time on their  online dashboard, some demonstrated deep reflections using the  live data on their fitbits displays [6]. For example, in a focus group  one student commented: [The Fitbit] it told me, how much weight,  how much calories I burned off every time I take a steps, and, um,  the times that I do for my activities.   We believe the school-like format and dry presentation of the  data itself was the problem with our initial dashboard, rather than  an unwillingness to engage with aggregate data or use inductive  reasoning about patterns.   3.2 User Context: I cant change anything  Further, analyzing the sociocultural contexts of these two sites [7]  reveals another design challenge in creating a successful  dashboard. The different communities with high and low SES offer  disparate affordances for activity in the community. We observed  that even when Capitol students in the low-income community  were engaging in their data, they reported barriers to changing their  activity. While Greenville students with access to parks, safe bike  paths, and sports clubs reported more access opportunities to  exercise based on learning from their data.   One goal of learning analytics is to promote individual learning  through reflection with personal data. But, our initial one-size  dashboard did not accommodate different activity opportunities in  different communities. Drawing on interview and focus group data  with students we reexamine providing community appropriate  feedback. Employing a standard framework for data interaction  unintentionally foregrounds the designers standard community  rather than the learners reality.         Figure 1: A Screen in the Terra Dashboard.   3.3 Design Goals and Future Work  First, to address confusion in user experience, we are now  developing a player dashboard more integrated in the game world  and game narrative. Our goal is to more richly frame the players  personal activity data in terms of game world goals and strategies.  This design allows players to set daily, weekly, or cumulative  activity goals on their game dashboard such as step count, total  mileage, improvement over baseline, intensity of activity, calories  burned, and then have those goals directly tied to progress toward  game world achievements. Drawing on the data representation  approaches already in use like the fitbit.com, integrating the youth- produced data into the game narrative makes these activity  analytics more accessible to youth.   Second, to incorporate user context, we continue to study how  young people examine and query their aggregate physical activity  data in ways that responds to unique community situations and  resources. We explore how youth engage with their dashboards and  how this engagement is connected to their physical activity. By  considering activity analytics through a sociocultural lens we can  design dashboards that address the plurality of health needs and  physical activity.   4.
