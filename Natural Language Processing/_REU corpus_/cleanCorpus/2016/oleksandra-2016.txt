However, it remains unclear whether the development of such  interpersonal relationships has the same influence on learning in  the context of large-scale open online learning. For instance, in  MOOCs group members frequently change and the volume of  interactions can quickly amass to chaos, therefore impeding an  individuals propensity to foster meaningful relationships. This  paper examined a MOOC for its potential to develop social  processes. As it is exceedingly difficult to establish a relationship  with somebody who seldom accesses a MOOC discussion, we  singled out a cohort defined by its participants regularity of  forum presence. The study, analysed this cohort and its  development, in comparison to the entire MOOC learner network.  Mixed methods of social network analysis (SNA), content  analysis and statistical network modelling, revealed the potential  for unfolding social processes among a more persistent group of  learners in the MOOC setting.

INTRODUCTION  It is well noted that student relationships formed via in-class  interactions can lead to improved academic performance,  resilience, satisfaction, and sense of belonging in their course of  study [13]. However, the ability to design a learning environment  conducive to such exchanges requires high-level skills in  moderating group processes and an understanding of the socio- emotional aspects of course-discussions. As online learning is  now the new normal for higher education, the design tasks and  discussion moderation processes have become far more complex  for teachers to undertake. The complexities associated with  facilitating effective course discussions are all the more salient  with the advent of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).  Shortcomings of forum technologies and teachers time  constraints limit the capacity for actively promoting interpersonal  interactions amongst the course participants. Whats more,  learners perceive the volume of interactions as overwhelming and  chaotic [9], casting doubt as to whether meaningful student  relationships can actually be formed. In this context, research  construes MOOC forums as learning in crowds, where learners  require well-developed skills to navigate networks of loosely  connected individuals dropping in and out of discussion in a  highly asynchronous manner [11].  Course size and the lack of cohort boundaries call into question  the degree to which trust, safety and similar socio-psychological  constructs associated with closely-knit small groups, occur in  open online learning environments. Research however, is yet to  offer a narrative as to how social processes unfold in MOOCs.  This paper summarizes a work-in-progress regarding what could  constitute a MOOC community of learners  a bounded group  motivated by learning and creating the terms for such learning  through socially shared interactions. Such a group could  potentially cultivate interpersonal relationships and gradually  deepen shared cognitive engagement.   2. PROBLEM FORMULATION  While research into learning at scale is relatively novel, much of  the work to date has been devoid of analytical frameworks distinct  for MOOC settings. Existing practices, especially for LMS- confined courses, largely stem from what worked for bounded  groups coming together to take a class for credit with common  commencement and completion dates. Theories of online  education are also situated in research traditions analysing micro- level interactions in small groups with a local focus. Yet,  academic work continues to draw on the theories and models of  the old paradigm without nuancing these to a rapidly changing  education landscape. Theories are being replanted from a  conventional online course into the open online environment. For  instance, Kilgore and Lowenthal [8] transferred the community of  inquiry model directly to the MOOC context, and reported the  social presence scores. Similarly, Kellogg et al. [7] applied  Gunawardenas knowledge construction framework to an entire  MOOC cohort. In both examples the theoretical lenses assume  progressive interactions of the same learners over an extended  period of time, and it is unclear, for example, how to appropriately  interpret the low levels of knowledge construction or social  presence that is collected from a one-time drop-in forum  participant. In essence, these authors have applied research  frameworks from more formal education settings to learning in an  open environment without testing if the theoretical assumptions  still hold.  While it is uncertain if social processes in MOOCs evolve  similarly to those in formal online courses, researchers analysed  MOOC participation and identified varying student engagement  patterns [1,3].

The  social dynamics among those with sustained forum activity may  compare to the social processes in formal courses.  This study is geared towards understanding the social forms  emerging on MOOC forums through the analysis of a more  persistent group of forum contributors. For this purpose, we  delineated a sub-group of forum participants contributing to the  forum in a repeated manner, and experiencing timely replies to  their posts. Although the volume of the contributions varied, a  common element among the identified participants was their  repeated presence on the forum. Networks of the entire MOOC  cohort and this delimited group were constructed. Through SNA  the frequency and intensity of co-occurrences of dyads in forum  conversations were identified, along with the structure capturing  these co-occurrences. Since SNA indicated growth of cohorts  activity, we hypothesized that the socio-emotional processes  pertinent to communities may have taken place. Hence,  conversations by the regular participants were qualitatively  analysed in relation to their triggers. Exponential random graph  modelling was, then, applied to test whether the types of  conversations and the structural influence of their contributors  drove the formation of ties.   3. FRAMING THE RESEARCH  Networked learning (NL) was adopted as a theoretical framework  to describe the overlapping relationships that co-exist in the  complex social organizations that manifest in educational settings  [6]. In contrast with most theoretical approaches to learning,  analysing a social entity from the NL perspective does not bias or  privilege the strong relationships that imply closeness and unity of  purpose within a group of actors. In line with sociocultural roots  of NL, the content of ties underpinning the network of regular  contributors was examined to contextualize the relations between  the network actors. Such contextualization was done in relation to  whether the ties appeared to be triggered by cognitive or socio- emotional needs of the learners [10], and whether in relation to  course assignments or other issues.   The study addressed the following research questions:  1. How does a network of regular forum participants compare to  the overall MOOC cohort  2. What is the content shared by the regular participants  3. Do structural learner characteristics and conversation types  define the formation of the regular participants network   4. METHODS  3.1 Data  The data were collected from the Solar Energy MOOC offered by  the Delft University of Technology via the edX platform. The  course lasted eight weeks, comprising 57091 students with 2730  receiving a certificate of completion. The MOOC was designed as  a bachelor level foundation course, and required basic knowledge  of physics and math. Forum facilitation strategy consisted of staff  and student community assistants actively attending to student  concerns.   3.2 User Groups  A total of 5949 students posted on the forum. Some 3221  individuals had received, at least once, a reply from another peer.  This group of individuals is referred to as all learners. The sub- population excluded 2728 individuals whose posts were not   replied to by another forum participant. For the MOOC under  study learner activity stabilized by the first 3 weeks of the course  offering [14]. Thus, participation in a mutual and timely  interaction experienced by a learner in at least three weeks of the  course was chosen as the criterion for the inclusion in the group of  regular participants (regular forum contributors) resulting in a  group of 254 individuals.   3.3 Social Network Analysis  A series of undirected weighted networks for both the all learners  and regular participants groups were constructed. These networks  constituted participants co-occurrences in forum conversations,  i.e. discussions defined by taking turns and contributing answers  to one specific question or problem. That is, if A posted a  question, and B and C replied to it, then A, B and C would all be  linked by undirected edges in a graph.   Instead of week-by-week analyses we approached the MOOC as  lasting one introductory week and three thematic modules. Thus,  the networks were compared across four time periods,  corresponding to the assessed course modules: i) Stage 1 for the  first week of the course; ii) Stage 2 for thematic module 1 in  weeks two and three; iii) Stage 3 for the thematic module 2 in  weeks four, five and six; iv) stage 4 for thematic module 3 in  weeks seven and eight. Using the igraph package in R [2], classic  network measures were calculated for the networks of all learners  and regular forum contributors. Influential participants were  identified by the application of k-means clustering to learners  betweenness and clustering coefficients in the all contributors  network.   3.4 Content Analysis  A bipartite network was constructed to identify shared content  produced by the regular participants. It included 986  conversations where at least two regular participants co-occurred.  These conversations were sorted into four categories. Cognitive  Task included conversations explicitly triggered by course tasks,  such as quizzes and graded assignments. Social Task referred to  participants sense-making of their ability to complete course  tasks or understand course content. These conversations may have  related to the course lectures, quizzes or graded assignments but  focused on participants emotions, such as frustration or  excitement about tasks. Cognitive Non-Task reflected the  participants attempt to engage with the subject matter through  other sources but quizzes, exams or assignments. These explicitly  related to the concepts or interests related to the courses topic, i.e.  conversations about learner-made home pv-systems or politics of  solar energy. Social Non-Task focused on social aspects, i.e.  introductions, norm setting or the purpose of MOOCs. Through  these conversations course participants shared their understanding  of what being in the MOOC should be, and negotiated the  expected and the acceptable values (e.g. whether an infinite  number of attempts on graded quizzes was more appropriate than  one and only pass or fail). During the coding process additional  categories emerged. The MOOC forum contained conversations  asking about the course structure (deadlines and certification) and  technical aspects of the MOOC (technical inquiries). These  conversations were subsequently grouped as Administrative and  Technical Inquiries. The remaining minor categories included a)  undefined conversations overlapping between several categories;  b) discussions related to meta-cognitive skills, such as advice on  how to learn best in a MOOC setting. The inter-rater reliability for  two coders was found to be Kappa= 0.72.   3.5 Statistical Network Modelling     ERGM [12] was applied to understand whether the formation of  network ties in the regular participants network was dependent on  any of the qualitative attributes derived during the research. One  bipartite network captured regular participants contributions and  types of conversations they co-participated in during the eight  official weeks of the course. In this instance, if two people  contributed to the same conversation, instead of being linked to each  other, they would have an undirected tie to the discussion node. For  ERGM, participants were assigned attributes in accordance with  their k-cluster (Section 4.3), while discussions nodes were labeled  under a correspondent category from qualitative analysis (Section  4.4). Data were analyzed with the ergm package in R [4]. Goodness  of fit was estimated as suggested in [5].   4. RESULTS  4.1 Structural Analysis  Research question 1 compared the structure of interactions  underpinning regular forum contributors with that of the broader  cohort. The results suggest that the regular participants network  had a higher potential for establishing relationships within its  dyads. The structure of co-occurrences for regular forum  contributors was not dense, and yet the more present participants  co-occurred more often, their exchanges had more turn taking, and  their participation grew over time, particularly from Stage 1 to  Stage 3. The regular participants network was structurally  dependent on a non-clique of individuals who met more learners,  and exchanged interactions with each other more frequently. Due  to their brokering power (high betweenness and low clustering  coefficient) these individuals brokered information between less  active contributors.  The regular participants network represented about 10% of the  entire cohorts contributors. The activity from regular forum  contributors grew over time up until Stage 4 of the course. In  contrast the activity of all learners on the MOOC forum declined  (Table 1) over the course duration. The maximum edge weight maximum interactions between two individualsis observed  within regular participants network. A forum contributor in the all  learner network co-occurred with the same person about four  times (median degree). The median degree of co-participation  during the entire course for a regular participant was 14 times.   Table 1: Networks of the entire cohort and regular forum  contributors   Entire Cohort Regular Participants   Stages             1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4   Nodes          2042 846 641 493 121 174 213 149   Edges         20628 2253 1993 1425 415 559 832 483   Density         0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.06 0.04 0.04 0.04   Degree          0.11 0.3 0.25 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4   Betweenness 0.16 0.3 0.26 0.43 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4   Closeness    0.001 0.002 0.003 0.01 0.04 0.03 0.06 0.06     Repeated participation and higher frequency of interactions  suggested there was the potential for participants to become aware  of each other. Furthermore, the interactions exchanged by learners  also reflected foreshadowing the establishment of group norms,  characteristic of communities. The growth of the regular  participants network occurred up to Stage 3, but declined at Stage   4. The entire cohorts networks activity grew at that time. Such a  change may have been due to the late staff announcement noting  that students with a perfect exam score and active forum  contributions would be eligible for a draw into a free educational  trip for two MOOC participants. The motivation to fulfil the  eligibility criteria led to a sudden increase in forum activity during  the last two weeks of the course among those previously not  engaged in discussions. This increase in activity was not well  received by the regular participants with learners posting  messages discrediting such participation as superficial.  The two networks differed in relation to their centralization  measures. As anticipated, the regular participants network was  more centralized than the all learners network with a degree  value of 0.6 and 0.2, respectively. The closer the centralization  measure is to 1, the more highly centralized the network is, and  marked by the clear boundary between its core and periphery.  With the consideration of how the network was constructed, here  individuals participating in most conversations were likely to have  highest brokering power.  Table 2: Clusters of regular forum contributors based on their   node-level betweenness and clustering coefficient      Cluster      Participants, N   Cluster Centers   Clustering  Coefficient   Betweenness  Centrality   1 82 -0.88 0.024   2 8 -1.71 4.64   3 47 1.62 -0.25   4 118 0.08 -0.23     To capture the varying influence occupied by regular participants  in the network, we applied k-means clustering to individual  betweenness centrality and their clustering coefficient measured in  the entire course network. Betweenness here represented  participation in various discussions, thus brokering power of  carrying history of the group from one conversation to another.  Clustering coefficient indicated the level of individual  embeddedness in separate conversations. The observed results  (Table 3) explained 93% of the variability in the two selected  network measures for this group of participants. Cluster 2 with  eight individuals of very high betweenness and a low clustering  coefficient describes typical hyperactive participants (mostly,  community assistants) answering and participating in many  conversations. Cluster 1 with some 82 individuals is characteristic  of moderately active students whose structural positions in the  network are represented by their low clustering coefficient and  moderate betweenness.   4.2 Shared Conversations  The second research question investigated the shared content  negotiated through the interactions between the regular  participants. We were interested in the types of conversations  where most regular contributors have participated, as well as the  types of conversations they shared over the course (Table 3 and  4), to gain insight whether group formation processes could have  been present. We observed that in the early course stage, regular  forum contributors had opportunities to converse on issues  building towards group development, such as defining the context,  expectations and setting common ground. Later stages indicate the  increase of cognitive engagement, and last stage offered space for  socio-emotional processes of celebrating and sharing.  Conversations with the highest overlap of participants were of     socio-emotional non-task nature, or of longer depth around  difficult exam questions.   Cognitive conversations about the subject matter or course topic  provided the main content for discussions all throughout the  course. Regular contributors extensively and progressively  conversed about Solar Energy assignments and exams (cognitive  task and non-task conversations). The only exception was the first  week of the course where the regular participants have mostly co- occurred in conversations of socio-emotional non-task nature.    Table 3: Types of conversations by regular forum  contributors at the four different stages of the course   Categories  1 2 3 4   Cognitive   task 14% 39% 65% 49%   non-task 16% 15% 12% 23%   Socio-emotional   task 4% >3% 2% 2%   non-task 43% 10% 4% 4%   Other  info-queries 17% 17% 11% 16%   mixed 3% 6% 4% 3%   Meta-cognitive  1% 2% 1% 0.2%     In the MOOC the cognitive conversations differed, and the  opening and closing of the course were also characterized by  higher volume of content-relevant but not-course specific  discussions of broader Solar Energy issues (cognitive non-task).  Conversations about politics and history of Solar Energy taken  place early in the course were not as value-neutral, as the task  discussions, and may have provided additional opportunities for  establishing a baseline of activity. Relational contingency tables  revealed that both more and less influential learners participated in  cognitive conversations.   Socio-emotional non-task conversations throughout the entire  course served for negotiation of rules and norms typical to  communities, with highest volume in the opening week. Socio- emotional conversations comprised 43% of all interactions in  Stage 1. Some of the bulk of socio-emotional conversations at  Stage 1 can be explained through introductions. While these  overwhelm participants due to their volume, they also provided a  snapshot of those taking the course, and helped participants decide  how much they self-identify with the crowd. For example,  whether an individual shared a common need to take the course  and whether it was of a professional interest to form relationships  beyond simple task-related Q&A. However, socio-emotional  conversations were far more diverse than just introductions. The  regular participants conversed about accepted forum behaviors  such as hacking the system or posting task answers before the  deadline; the need and appropriateness of having staff in the  forums. Students discussed the quality of teaching, provided  suggestions for forum improvement, and reflected on the purpose  of learning in MOOCs, i.e. learning to know or learning to receive  a grade.    Informational and administrative queries comprised up to 17% of  all the conversations shared between regular participants. Many  occasional participants queries were related to simple  administrative issues (deadlines) or simple technical issues (e.g.  typing a formula to score in quizzes). Similar issues had been  raised early on in the course, but then appeared to come up again  and again raised by course latecomers. In relation to the   conversations about the learning strategies, structurally influential  students throughout the course largely contributed to these.  Regular contributors had opportunities to engage in the  development of social processes to define them as a community,  but not all of them were active in these conversations. Regular  participants conversations (Table 4) that received the most input  were either socio-emotional non-task in nature from early in the  course, or cognitive task-related taken place during the exam time  at the end of Stage 2 - Stage 3. Shared socio-emotional non-task  conversations related to the MOOC and what the course  represented for its participants. More central content task-related  conversations were of longer depth and evolved around difficult  exam questions. Finally, informational and technical inquiries  about how to make the system work for participants early on also  received a lot of overlap in regular participants where they  offered constructive solutions and set the tone for what their  community would become.   Table 4: Top 5 conversations with highest regular  participants overlap   Type                                               Interactions, N         Contributors, N                  Occasional Regular   Social Non-task 52 23 15   Cognitive Task/Social Non-Task 46 5 15   Cognitive Task 26 4 15   Informational Query 103 62 13   Social Non-Task 39 12 12   4.3 Statistical Modeling  From the first and the second research questions we concluded  that there was the potential for learners to form peer-relationships  within the regular participants network. It also appeared that  types of conversations were representative of the formation of a  community of learners. Through statistical network modeling, we  inquired if the structural learner characteristics (influential and  others) and conversation types (cognitive, socio-emotional,  informational) defined the formation of the regular contributors  network. We report one large ERGM (AICModel=26109;  AICNullModel=29925) that included main effects controlling for the  effect of cluster activity and discussions types, as well as  homophily and interaction effects (Table 5).  Throughout all attempted models Clusters 1 and 2 had a  significant effect over the network development. It is also  noteworthy that Cluster 2, with extreme propensity to form edges  did not reveal a tendency for homophily, while Cluster 1 did. That  is, the edge to a conversation was likely to have been formed  between two learners that were characterized by somewhat high  betweenness and somewhat low clustering coefficient.  The effects of the discussion types were not significant for  network modeling. Such results could be anticipated given the  limitations of current modeling. First of all, the network did not  model learner interactions at 4 time stages, but all through the  course, which could level the importance of conversations that  were only of relevance in specific course stages. Furthermore,  modeled learner influence was determined only via forum  contributions (posts), and excluded learner-to-learner interactions  resulting from forum views, i.e. how often each learner post was  read and by whom. Since many posts require one answer, a lag in  viewing a post may result in a non-contribution (absence of the  edge). Our future work will include all interactions executed by     the delineated cohort (forum views and forum posts), as well as  account for the lag between a published post and the length of  time for a participant to view the post.

CONCLUSIONS  Interpersonal relationships students form can provide cognitive  and emotional support that ultimately benefit the learning process.  However, in the context of MOOCs the sheer size and fluid group  boundaries may impede a learners capacity to establish such  effective relationships. To begin understanding how social  processes unfold at scale, this paper analysed a MOOC forum  crowds potential for developing social processes. Analyses  focused on the social formation within the forum defined by how  often its participants contributed to the forum. Similar to its  bounded counterparts in formal online education, such a group  could potentially cultivate interpersonal relationships and  gradually deepen a shared cognitive engagement.  The imposed cohort was analysed in relation to the frequency  and intensity of interpersonal interactions within it, and to the  prompts behind the groups conversations. In the analysed course,  the MOOC crowd included a group of learners with varying  volume of participation but relatively persistent regularity of  contributions. SNA indicated that through their repeated  participation such a group had more opportunities for establishing  relationships. As the activity of the entire group grew over time,  the more present learners co-occurred more often, and their  exchanges had more turn taking indicating sustained conversation.  Qualitative analyses highlight the types of conversations where  shared group processes occurred. Early course stages offered  opportunities for defining the context, expectations and setting  common ground, later stages indicated the increase of cognitive  engagement, and final stages offered space for socio-emotional  processes of celebrating and sharing. Statistical modelling  highlighted the role of non-clique of brokers and moderately  active learners in developing the network and maintaining group  history.     6.
