INTRODUCTION  The continuous advancement of teaching and learning with the  increasing use of technology within the vast selections of modules  offered in higher education has been evident over the years. Most  examples of the advancement are contributed by the increasing use  of online learning systems in the learning environment. The rapid  embracing of such technology and its pervasive use in teaching and  learning have been brought about by strong supporting changes,  ranging from institutional vision and philosophy towards  encouraging the use of technology, to the rising focus of building   and developing educators competencies in using technologies to  enhance instructional design.    A common use of learning systems in education is the wide range  of multimedia functionalities, which offer many features that can  enhance student learning. One study uses computers multimedia  capabilities to lend a sensory component that help reinforce  concepts and appeal to a wider variety of approaches to learning  [31]. It is highlighted that graphical aspects help students visualize  two- and three-dimensional geometric figures and represent  mathematical ideas such as the nature of arithmetic versus  exponential growth. It is further emphasized that students can make  conjectures and experiment with these graphical representations to  see the results. Another team of researchers has also explored the  use of technology to explore the impact of multimedia resources  situated in a national e-learning portal to improve overall science  learning experiences [7].   For the School of Information Technology, Nanyang Polytechnic  in Singapore, the institution where our empirical research was  conducted, the introduction of online learning systems was focused  towards online tutorial and problem solving activities. The  introduction of online learning systems for teaching and learning of  computer programming for students in higher education has  benefited both the educators and the students. For the educators,  they are able to conduct their lessons using such systems as tools  for course material management, assignment submission, setting  and conducting of assessment, monitoring of grade performance  and student feedback. For the students, their learning deepens with  online collaborative work with peers, timely performance  feedback, instantaneous access to online course material, and  interactive engagement of online assignments. Although a lot has  been done to facilitate teaching and learning with the use of  technology as a communicative and collaborative channel, very  little study has been done on cognitive processes of students as they  learn using online tools, particularly in the field of human-computer  interaction, on how the instructional design stimulates higher-order  cognitive activities.   Learning is also optimized when accompanied by problem solving  activities [6], and problem solving induces higher-order cognitive  activities learning as it forces students to be active participants in  their learning rather than passive information receivers [2]. Online  courses such as those provided by lyndaCampus and Codecademy  are integrated into various academic modules to heighten the  learning experience of the students. However, individual  differences among the students would account for a variance in  learning outcomes [18, 25].

Another study also highlights that  learners cognitive load fluctuates during interaction while using  online learning tools [4]. From prior research studies, cognitive  activities and deep thinking has corresponded to measurements  such as eye fixations, saccades, dwell time percentage, pupil  diameter and blink rate [4, 24, 27, 28, 29]. It is unclear, however,  as to how these measurements eye movements by learners are  related to their learning experiences, and if learning indeed do  occurs, how such readings are related to individual academic results  in recent past, or use as a predictive method for future academic  performances. To our knowledge, no research work has been done  to explore these connections. Our study will thus attempt to  determine the different patterns of eye fixations and saccades of  students learning computer programming from such online learning  systems, in particular Codecademy, to their individual academic  abilities and performances via grading achieved from related  programming modules. The result will seek to help educators  understand the effectiveness of the online learning systems towards  achieving higher-order cognitive processing, when applied to their  students.   2. RELATED WORK  The use of eye tracking technology in the study of cognitive  processing has seen an increasing amount of interest in recent  research works. Most of the literature are based on two theoretical  assumptions about the relation between eye movement and  cognitive processing, namely the immediacy assumption and the  eye-mind assumption, referring to the work of Just & Carpenter  [19]. In immediacy assumption, information processing is  immediate and occurs when the information is encountered. In eye- mind assumption, the visual information that falls within the focus  of attention is also being processed, and the direction of gaze is  closely associated with the focus of attention. We have thus  conducted our research with these theoretical assumptions in mind.   Before the use of eye tracking technology in educational  psychology and educational research, thinking aloud was the  method employed in most studies on cognitive processing [3, 5,  16]. In the attempt to understand what happens during learning,  some studies have generally used the think-aloud research  methodology while readers are involved in text processing.  However, this methodology is known to have a limitation of being  intrusive. It is suggested that thinking aloud may alter the process  of thinking itself, because it requires cognitive resources that  should be used in carrying out the primary task of learning [22].  Eye tracking does not have this limitation. It does not interrupt  normal reading, and thus will not lead to disruptions in cognitive  processing. The eye tracking data collected will completely account  for the allocation of visual attention of the learner during task  execution, and such measures can be used to draw inferences about  cognitive processes.   Prior research works on eye tracking collects fixation duration and  gaze duration measurements to draw inferences about cognitive  processes [26]. Single fixation duration refers to cases where only  a single fixation is made on a word, and gaze duration refers to the  sum of all fixations on a word prior to moving to another word. In  general, researchers agree that visual attention is related to  cognitive processing activities. It is through the interpretation of  eye movement data that researchers attempt to understand the  relationship of such measures and the underlying cognitive  processes.   In our study of students interaction using a technology enhanced  learning environment, we are inspired by the works of Hyn &  Lorch [13], where they have highlighted that the various segments  that comprise a text are not given equal processing time. Another  similar research paper has also indicated that a text segment that  introduces a new topic or a new narrative episode is attended more  than the segments that are continuations of the same topic or  episode [21]. The conclusive segment at the end of the text has also  been found to receive more attention, and the end sentences have  been considered as the location of gaze for wrap up processing  [11]. This inequality of attention was also highlighted in other  similar works [9, 10], where it was reported that an increase in  cognitive load leads to longer fixation duration and an increase in  the number of fixations.    In another of such research work, eye fixations were recorded  during the reading of information of three pulley system  configurations of increasing complexity [11]. The analysis from the  collected data indicated that the readers from the university  community often reread the text to process specific information  about a component or set of components before building a spatial  mental model. Another particularly appropriate measure for our  study is suggested by Nielson [23], who has highlighted important  findings on the sequence of scanning objects on screen. From his  research, he assumes that headlines are examined first, then pictures  as well as diagrams and visual examples, followed finally by text.  This assumption will also be looked into in our study as well.   An important consideration for our study, as suggested by  Kruschke et al. [20], is that the pattern of learning varies across  individuals but is relatively stable within individuals. Similar  findings have also highlighted differences in pattern of learning,  where some participants achieved high accuracy very rapidly in  simple tasks, while others learn gradually [30], as well as  distinguishing between experts and novices eye movement  profiles [17] For this study, we will attempt to identify distinctive  characteristics in learning among the students.   In analysing the transition of eye fixation patterns, prior works have  used various methods towards determining a wide spectrum of  pattern types [32]. Methods such as network analysis on the  transition of eye fixations have highlighted different combinations  of the transition patterns of fixations.   However, to the best of our knowledge, the detailed studies above  did not conclude if there were any distinctive connections among  the patterns of learning and the performance of the learners in  related academic modules. This knowledge is advantageous to both  educators and learners, especially in understanding academic  performance, and improving on instructional design. Our empirical  research in this paper attempts to address this gap.   3. METHODS  3.1 Research Questions  Following the introduction and literature review in the previous  sections, we are particularly interested in the following research  questions:   Q1. What are the distinctive eye fixation patterns of the students  engaging in the online tutorials   Q2. How are the fixation patterns connected with the students  performances in related academic modules     3.2 Experiment Setup  A total of 60 final year students from the School of Information  Technology, Nanyang Polytechnic, were involved in the  experiment. They were at the start of their Final Year Project  module, and were selected to complete a series of online tutorials  to learn how to program in PHP using an online learning tool called  Codecademy. Each student did not have prior knowledge of  programming in PHP, and were new to the online learning  environment of Codecademy. The students were also selected  randomly. English as the medium of instruction was not highlighted  as a problem for any of the students.   3.3 The Codecademy Tutorials   The students were to individually complete 13 tasks regarding  different programming functions and features of PHP, a popular  programming language. These tasks were made available in the  form of an online interactive learning module provided by  Codecademy. An example of the online learning environment user  interface is shown in Figure 1.             Figure 1: User Interface of Codeacademy   For the online interactive PHP tutorials, the user interface is divided  into 5 main blocks. Introduction(A), Instructions(B) and Hints(C)  are arranged in sequence on the left column of the screen. The  programming Editor(D) is provided at the centre of the screen. A  programming Output(E) is displayed on the top right corner of the  screen to show the results generated by the program.   The 13 tasks were presented to each student in sequence.  Introduction presented the title and fundamentals of the task,  followed by Instructions of how to solve the task. Once the students  completed each task, they would click the Save and Submit Code  button, to proceed to the next task. If a task was done incorrectly,  an error message would be displayed at the bottom of the screen,  and the student would not be allowed to proceed to the next task.  An option for hints was provided for students who were not able to  proceed and thus needed some guiding help. Hints were not  displayed unless requested for.    Experimental sessions were conducted individually for each  student using a setup as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, using an  eye tracking device from Eye Tribe connected to a laptop in a  computer laboratory.   Each data collection session for a student to complete all require  tasks lasted from 15 to 30 minutes. At the start of each session, the  eye tracking device would be calibrated for each student, before the  student proceeded to complete the tasks online. A video screen  capture was also recorded while the student proceeded with  completing the online tasks. This was to validate eye tracking   records with matching movements and inputs as they complete the  online tutorials.        Figure 2: Eye Tribe scanner connected to a laptop           Figure 3: A student during an experimental session   3.4 Methodology  Our study focuses on the investigation of eye fixation patterns of  students engaging in online learning tool, with the use of eye  tracking analysis as the basic method [8, 12]. There are three main  eye tracking parameters used in this study, namely the number of  fixations, the duration of fixations and sequence of saccades.  Fixation plots are generated to reveal the areas of interest of each  participant as they progress through their online tutorials. Scan  paths that display the series of saccades and the time duration for  each fixation are also generated and analysed.   3.5 Data Collection Using Eye Tribe  The Eye Tribe eye tracking device came with a software that helped  capture eye movement coordinates, determine fixations, and record  a time stamp for each fixation. The records were generated into a  text file at the end of each session. After conducting data collection  for all students, the text files were retrieved and stored for further  analysis.   The text files containing eye movement data were subsequently  imported into Tableau Desktop 9.0 to generate fixation plots across  different areas. Our research found that the fixation plots can be  classified into 3 distinctive patterns (Figure 4.1  4.3), which were  generated from the students based on the number of fixations,  corresponding to the 5 main blocks in Codecademys user interface,  as they complete the online tutorials assigned. This is done by  visual observation of the plot patterns generated by the  visualisation software.   Eye Tribe  Scanner   (A)   (B)   (C)   (D) (E)          Figure 4.1: Pattern with fixations across all blocks (Type FP1)          Figure 4.2: Pattern without many fixations on Introduction  and Instructions, but a lot on Hints (Type FP2)           Figure 4.3: Pattern with many fixations on all blocks except  Hints (Type FP3)   The first type of pattern (Type FP1) produced a consistent  distribution of fixations to all blocks while completing the tasks.  Students who displayed this pattern of engagement started by  attempting to comprehend the topics as explained in the  Introduction, and subsequently tried to complete the tasks  displayed in the Instructions block. However, the high count in  fixations to Hints suggested that these students had failed in   completing the tasks, and had requested for help within the Hints  block. This is due to the students finding the tasks too advanced or  having misconceptions in the tasks.   Students who displayed the pattern similar to that of the second type  (Type FP2), with low count of fixations on Introduction and  Instructions but a lot on Hints, may generally had completed the  tasks by copying the solutions from the hints. Their fixation plot  suggested that they did not value the need to understand the  rudiments of the topics, and favoured more towards completing the  tasks quickly. It could thus be inferred that since these students  appear not to participate in cognitive activities with respect to the  understanding of the topics, they had not effectively learned from  Introduction or Instructions blocks.    Students who displayed the pattern that corresponded with the third  type (Type FP3), with little fixations to Hints, generally completed  the tasks by reading through the introduction and instructions. Their  fixation plot suggested that they attempted to comprehend the  fundamentals of the topics, and followed the instructions  accordingly. The low count in fixations to Hints suggested that the  learning strategy of these students was to process the requirements  within the text of the instructions and to try to produce the solution  according to their understanding. These students were thus  considered to have higher-order cognitive activities while fixing  their attention on learning from Introduction and Instructions  throughout their sessions [10, 12].   Scan paths were also generated for our study, to observe the  sequences of attention focus, as well as the patterns of look-back  and rereading behaviours. Such patterns of scanning behaviours  were studied extensively [15], where 4 types of reading strategy  were identified with their distinctive features. Fast linear readers  did not make return fixations on previous texts. Slow linear  readers made many rechecks before moving on. Non-selective  readers made many look-backs to previous sentences. Topic  structure readers paid close attention to headings and were also  those who produce the most accurate text summaries, a measure of  knowledge retention by the participants. These similar findings  were again highlighted in another study, where it was found that  the quality of recalls of the main ideas presented in the text also  correlated with the amount of time spent on look-back and  rereading by the participants [14].   Scan plots of the data collected from all the sessions were  generated. It was observed that the participants scan plots largely  fell into 3 most profound and distinguished types (Figure 5.1 -   Figure 5.3).   For the first type (Type SP1) of scan path in Figure 5.1, it mirrored  characteristics similar to slow linear readers, as students started  by placing their attention to headings in Introduction and  Instructions, and made many rechecks as they move their attention  between the Introduction and Instructions blocks. The darker the  shades of the plots around a localized area, the longer is their gaze.  For the second type (Type SP2) of scan path in Figure 5.2, it  mirrored characteristics similar to fast linear readers, and is  similar to the previous type in terms of its linear scan path sequence.  However, these students quickly move their attention to Editor and  Output as they complete their tasks without frequent rechecks to  headings in Introduction and Instructions. For the third type (Type  SP3) of scan path in Figure 5.3, students displayed a significant  amount of look-backs to Instructions as the students complete their  task on the Editor. This type of scan path resembled that of topic  structure readers.          Figure 5.1: Scan path showing characteristics of slow linear  readers with darker plots (Type SP1)           Figure 5.2: Scan path showing characteristics of fast linear  readers with lighter plots (Type SP2)           Figure 5.3: Scan path showing characteristics of topic  structure readers (Type SP3)      3.6 The Datasets  We conducted Linear Regression analyses using records gathered  to form 3 datasets. For the first dataset (snapshot in Table 1), we  are able to derive from the eye fixations data the number of counts  of Fixation Plot Type (FP1  FP3) from the set of completed  tutorials for each student.         Table 1: Excerpt of data showing counts of Fixation Plot Type  for tutorials completed by each student.

Table 2: Excerpt of data showing counts of Scan Path Type  for tutorials completed by each student.

As a third  (final) year student, all students will have completed 4 semesters of  project modules (Proj01  Proj04).    From the grades score of the 4 project modules, we further  aggregated the score to obtain the average score (ProjAve). We also  recorded the students Grade Point Average (GPA) of all academic  modules which the students obtained by the end of Year 2  (Yr2GPA).

RESULTS  This study seeks to understand how the fixation plot and scan path  are related to the project and academic grades of the students, we  used SPSS Statistics version 22 to run regression analysis on the  datasets collection mentioned in the previous section. For this  study, the multiple regression model used are having three  independent variables, namely FP1  FP3 for fixation plot analysis,  and SP1  SP3 for scan path analysis. The following sections will  show the effects of both fixation plot and scan path on project  average and end of Year 2 GPA scores, by deriving the coefficient  of the three independent variables for the linear regression analyses.   4.1 Fixation Plot and Project Average  Table 4 below shows the coefficients of the independent variables  FP1  FP3 effect on the project average (ProjAve).

Linear Regression through the Origin  The Adjusted R Square value for this analysis is 0.996, which  means that our linear model fits a set of observations very well.  From the results above, it can be seen that FP3 has the highest  standardized coefficient value that contributes positively to the  prediction of project average scores of the pool of students. It can  also be seen that FP1, having the lowest standardized coefficient  value, provides the least in the prediction of the students project  average grades. The randomness of the residual vs fitted plot below  shows that regression analysis is not biased.

Linear Regression through the Origin  For this analysis, the Adjusted R Square value is 0.978, which also  signifies the strength of the relationship between the model and the  response variables. FP3 is shown again to have the highest  standardized coefficient value of 0.608, suggest that it provides the  most effect for the students GPA performance. Likewise, 0.37 for  FP1 may suggest the lowest in contribution towards the prediction  of GPA grades. However, since the p-value for SP1 is 0.386, and  since it is over the common alpha value of 0.05, it also indicates  that it is not statistically significant. Figure 7 shows the randomness  of the residual vs fitted plot.     Figure 7: Residual vs Fitted Plot for Fixation Plot Type effect   on GPA   4.3 Scan Path and Project Average  Table 6 below shows the coefficients of the independent variables  SP1  SP3 effect on the project average (ProjAve).   For this analysis, it is again noted that the Adjusted R Square value  is 0.996. the standardized coefficient for SP3 is highest at 0.54,  suggesting that students with scan path type associated to Topic  Structure Readers may also have the highest retention of  knowledge and skillsets, and thus lead to higher project average  scores. The standardized coefficient of SP1 is the lowest at 0.195,  suggesting that it contributes the least in prediction towards project  performance.

Linear Regression through the Origin  The linear regression report for this analysis also shows a high  Adjusted R Square value of 0.976. Similarly, from the above table,   SP3 has the highest standardized coefficient of 0.620, which  implies that it strongly supports GPA performances. It can also be  seen that for SP1, with a p-value of 0.330, it is not a significant  variable to affect students end of Year 2 GPA performance. Figure  9 below shows the randomness of the residual vs fitted plot.     Figure 9: Residual vs Fitted Plot for Scan Path Type effect on   GPA   5. DISCUSSION  The analysis from this research has enabled us to understand that  there are strong relations among different types of eye fixation  measurements and behavioural patterns in association with the  level of engagement in learning and the type of learners and their  traits towards learning. The results also suggested that students who  display different visual scanning behaviours have significantly  achieve different scores in their GPA and project grades. This may  give rise to early detection of students who may need more help and  assistance in learning well before the assessments at the end of the  semesters.   We can further suggest that although the approach towards learning  among the students varies, we found that students who are  identified as engaged learners using the online learning system, are  also high achievers in related academic modules. This finding  indicates that the students exhibit consistent learning traits across  modules conducted in the traditional methods of teaching, and  modules using online learning as a teaching tool. Therefore, by  capturing eye fixation measurements, educators may be able to  identify, even before any form of assessments, students who may  need more help in achieving better academic performance.  Educators can also use the findings as a measure of how effective  the instructional design of their online tutorials are in enhancing  learning with higher-order cognitive activities.   The limitations of this research study lie in the dependencies of the  results with the particular online UI of CodeAcademy. However, as  these UI features, namely onscreen blocks of Introduction,  Instructions, Hints, programming Editor and Outcome are  generally found in other Integrated development environments  (IDEs) for programming, our findings and insights remain useful  and applicable.. Other communicative and collaborative channels,  such as forum discussions and synchronous or asynchronous chat  features, may provide richer insights on the visual scanning  behaviours and traits of the students. In such cases, more variations  of eye fixation pattern types may arise, which could expand the  understanding of cognitive processing of different groups of  learners.   In order to deepen the understanding of the relationship between  eye fixation behaviours and cognitive activities, a more general   -10  -5  0  5  10  15  50 60 70 80 90R es id ua ls  Predicted	Value  -1.5  -1  -0.5  0  0.5  1  1 2 3 4  Re sid  ua ls  Predicted	Value    approach towards determining fixation plot and scan path types  should also be done to handle a larger variation of patterns [31].  Methods such as network analysis on the transition patterns of eye  fixations may result in more combinations of fixation plot and scan  path.   Another concern about the data collected is the inference of  cognitive activities and meaningful learning primarily from the  capturing of eye movement of the learners. During the course of  data collection, it is observed that students could also be in deep  thoughts while looking elsewhere, for example an open window, a  ceiling fan etc. Although these actions can also be moments  contributing to higher-order cognitive activities of the learners, the  Eye Tribe sensor did not capture them. Other types of detection  techniques, such as neuroimaging technique using  Electroencephalography (EEG) may be combined together with  eye tracking sensor data to increase the accuracy of the results.   6. CONCLUSION  This study has shown that online learning systems stimulate  cognitive activities, and that different students have displayed  different levels of engagement patterns through eye fixations.  These eye fixation patterns are also able to characterize different  types of learners, from the analysis of the dataset from eye tracking  technology that monitored the eye fixations of 60 final year  students engaging in online interactive tutorials at the start of their  Final Year Project module. Our findings further suggest that the  students visual scanning behaviours fall into three different types  of eye fixation patterns, with the data which corresponded to the  different types of learners having strong relations to the  performance of the students in other related academic modules. the  study thus concludes that this method of analysing eye fixation  patterns can identify different types of learners with respect to their  cognitive activities and academic potential, and also allow  educators to understand how their instructional design using online  learning environment can stimulate higher-order cognitive  activities.   For practical usage, the findings from this study have potentials of  allowing educators to understand the behaviours and attributes of  their students through the use of online learning tools. Although  this study uses the modest size of a datasets from the selected final  year students, it has nonetheless produce insights on the  possibilities of assessing and monitoring students learning  progress and performance apart from relying on traditional  assessment tools such as test and examination papers.   For future works, educators and researchers can also perform  research studies by providing different sets of instructional design  to facilitate online learning by different learners, and analyse the  patterns of other neuroscientific measurements of the students. The  measurements can be further studied to correlate with other  behavioural and/or academic performance metrics, to understand  how best to conduct online teaching and learning. It will be most  apparent for MOOCs, which are Massive Open Online Courses  designed for worldwide engagement, students demographical data,  time zones, language competencies etc., may also affect online  engagement behaviours.   7.
