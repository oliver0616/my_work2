Recently, the learning analytics community at  large has more actively addressed the EP4LA issues, and we are  now starting to see learning analytics solutions that are designed  not only as an afterthought, but also with these issues in mind.  The 2nd EP4LA@LAK16 workshop will bring the discussion on  ethics and privacy for learning analytics to a the next level,  helping to build an agenda for organizational and technical design  of LA solutions, addressing the different processes of a learning  analytics workflow.

INTRODUCTION  Since the Ethics & Privacy for Learning Analytics (EP4LA)   workshop at LAK15 it has become more and more clear that  Ethics and Privacy issues play a major role in preparing for large- scale adoption of learning analytics. Cases of moral panics are  still used to create attention to these important issues  the  infamous inBloom case in USA [1], and the less known Stiching  Snapped case in the Netherlands [2] are both cases in point. Now  we start to see that ethics and privacy are not only an afterthought  when something has gone wrong; it starts to be built into the new  designs from the very beginning. This workshop will focus on  how ethics and privacy concerns would form the basis, on which  technical architectures and educational practices will be built.   Literature review for the EP4LA@LAK15 workshop found few  papers published related to ethics and privacy in the research field  known as learning analytics, and even fewer policies or  guidelines regarding privacy, legal protection rights or other  ethical implications [3]. Now a special issue of Journal of  Learning Analytics on ethics and privacy is in press, with a  number of articles originating from the LAK workshop [4].  Furthermore, projects funded to do research and developments  within the field of learning analytics now have deliverables  addressing ethics and privacy [5].      2. ETHICS & PRIVACY IN APPLICATION  DESIGN  Another recent trend is implementation of Codes of Practice for  Learning Analytics. JISC, a charitable organization supporting the  use of digital technologies in UK education and research,  supported by LACE and other European projects has developed a  Code of Practice covering the main issues institutions need to  address in order to progress ethically and in compliance with the  law [6]. The first university to establish an institutional Code of  Practice for Learning Analytics was the Open University, UK [7].   A Code of Practice is only the first step in developing a new  ecosystem for learning analytics that allows large-scale adoption.

We are now starting to  see these architectures emerge [8].   The Workshop at LAK16 will take stock of current ethics and  privacy-led design for learning analytics and contribute to an  agenda for large-scale implementations that goes beyond mere  policy guidelines.   3. WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION  3.1 Overall Motivation  The Workshop will develop an agenda for EP4LA-based design  of organizational and technical infrastructures based on the recent  awareness of the importance of ethical and privacy issues related  to big data. This years workshop will build on and strengthen the  impact of the EP4LA@LAK15 workshop and drive the discussion  in the direction of actions that could be implemented in  educational cultures and technologies.      3.2 Workshop Objectives  The Workshop builds on the series of EP4LA workshops1, which  for the one in LAK15 gathered around 50 participants discussing  five papers. The target audience for the Workshop this year is  LAK participants, both managers and developers, who want to see  EP4LA crystalized as a set of requirements and blueprints for  organizational and technical designs that could be implemented in  different sectors of the educational ecosystem. Following the path  of data sharing through the different processes of a LA system,  e.g., Learning Activity, Data Collection, Data Storing and  Processing, Analyzing, Visualization, and Feedback Actions  (Figure1), the objective of the Workshop is to give the  participants input to build an agenda for ethics and privacy for all  these processes.     Figure 1: Processes in a Learning Analytics cycle      3.3 Workshop Organization  A Call for Papers will be issued outlining the objectives of the  Workshop. The organizers are confident that they have a  community outreach that would result in paper submission  covering the full range of the LA ecosystem. The 3 hours  workshop will be organized as both paper presentation and  discussions along the lines of the LA process model.      3.4 Workshop Facilitators   The workshop will be organized jointly by the FP7 EU LACE  project (http://www.laceproject.eu), the Apereo Foundation, the  Asian-Pacific Society of Computers in Education (APSCE) SIG  on Learning Analytics  (https://sites.google.com/site/  apscesiglaedm/) and the European Association for Technology  Enhanced Learning (EATEL) SIG dataTEL (http://ea-tel.eu/sig-                                                                    1 http://www.laceproject.eu/ethics-privacy-learning-analytics/   datatel/). All partners aim at advancing the learning analytics field  by coming up with practical solutions and guidelines for ethical &  privacy issues that are a critical part of most data-driven research  in Education. The main goals are to increase the knowledge and  awareness about ethical and privacy boundaries of Learning  Analytics research and practice, to identify existing theories of  trust and privacy, to promote the re-use of best practice solutions  on privacy and ethics, to foster the cooperation between different  Learning Analytics research units, and to develop a kind of code  of honor for Learning Analytics research supported by IT based  legal tools.       4.
