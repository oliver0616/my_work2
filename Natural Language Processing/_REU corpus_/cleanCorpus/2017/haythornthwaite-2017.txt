An Information Policy Perspective on Learning Analytics  Caroline Haythornthwaite   Syracuse University  School of Information Studies   343 Hinds Hall  chaythor@syr.edu     ABSTRACT  Policy for learning analytics joins a stream of initiatives aimed at  understanding the expanding world of information collection,  storage, processing and dissemination that is being driven by  computing technologies.  This paper offers a information policy  perspective on learning analytics, joining work by others on ethics  and privacy in the management of learning analytics data [8], but  extending to consider how issues play out across the information  lifecycle and in the formation of policy. Drawing on principles  from information policy both informs learning analytics and  brings learning analytics into the information policy domain. The  resulting combination can help inform policy development for  educational institutions as they implement and manage learning  analytics policy and practices. The paper begins with a brief  summary of the information policy perspective, then addresses  learning analytics with attention to various categories of  consideration for policy development.

INFORMATION POLICY  Information policy is a relatively new area of research and  practice. In its larger domain,  information policy is concerned  with public policy relating to information use and addresses legal,  ethical and moral positions and practices pertaining to information  from creation through use to disposition. Sandra Braman [3][4]  most comprehensively defines the area, addressing the impact on  government of the transformation to an information state, and  providing this definition:   Information policy is comprised of laws, regulations, and  doctrinal positions  and other decision making and practices  with society-wide constitutive effects  involving  information creation, processing, flows, access, and use.

The definition and distinction among these activities results from  a synthesis of the many, many conceptualizations of information  production chains that are used implicitly and explicitly across  disciplines ([4], p.3). Braman argues that [m]arking the  boundaries of the domain with information creation, processing,  flows, access, and use provides a synthetic and succinct heuristic  that meets important evaluative criteria that are valid,  comprehensive, theoretically sound, and translatable into the  multiple languages in which the audiences of information policy  speak ([4], p. 3).   These information activities are easily translatable for systems  analysis and learning analytics into the stages of the information  lifecycle. Although activities is no doubt a better term (given  that processes of information creation, use, etc. will overlap in  everyday practice), the lifecycle concept provides a procedural  approach to understanding where policy is needed in the  management of learning analytics data and information. And,  indeed, the information lifecycle has been used by others as a  framework for examining policy from an information perspective.  Pasek [18], for example, synthesizes discussion from several  papers in the information science area to tie information policy to  the information lifecycle phases of creation, production,  distribution, access, and use.    While intuitive and useful, an information lifecycle framework as  outlined by Pasek does lack some of the nuance of the Braman  categories. For example, by leaving out the concept of flows it is  possible to miss the idea that creation of an information resource  can be achieved by selecting from an ongoing stream (flow) of  information, e.g., by creating an archive of twitter posts, or by  curating an information flow to create a resources of selected,  topic specific postings. Similarly indexing is not explicitly  addressed; for twitter this may be the hashtag, forming a crowd-  based collaborative index to a stream of postings.   Both authors short lists also seem to give little prominence to the  disposition of information and data, where policies are needed to  address both retention and deletion of records. Attention to this  stage is well known in areas such as records management, and is  rapidly emerging in internet policy relating to issues around the  right to be forgotten [7].   Since learning analytics is an area that itself includes many,  many conceptualizations of information production chains, it is  an area that can benefit from engaging with information policy  frameworks. At the same time, learning analytics may be facing  issues not yet addressed in information policy, and examination of  learning analytic activities may inform information policy  development.  Writ broadly, information policy addresses issues relating to:  intellectual property, such as copyright; privacy of personal  information, particularly as related to government collection of  personal data; security of personal privacy as well as national     security in relation to intrusions into government information  systems; and access to information, including issues of literacy,  digital divide, and the role of libraries, archives and museums.    Well-known US government policies relating to information  policy include the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA),  Family Educational Rights and Protection Act (FERPA), Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), Freedom  of Information Act (FOIA), with similar acts found in many other  countries. Also known are government requests for information,  e.g., in the US Patriot Act (now Freedom Act), and undisclosed  domestic information gathering (e.g., by the US National Security  Agency)[14], with public opinion divided between acceptance and  rejection of such activities [19].   Organizations such as the American Library Association, and  movements such as Freedom from Surveillance [1][2] and  Freedom to Read [3] work in the information policy domain  to  effect change and education relating to government monitoring,  censorship and privacy relating to information access (e.g., non- disclosure of library or video borrower records). The ubiquity of  records and personal information on the Internet has driven efforts  for the Right To Be Forgotten (RTBF), with European initiatives  in this area leading the way [7][11][21]. Open data, open  government data, and sunlight initiatives advocate for open access  to government information to increase access to resources and to  support government transparency [20].    These areas of attention provide a framework for examining  learning analytics policy. It is possible then to frame the  discussion based on the information activities outlined by Braman  and/or the information lifecycle. We can ask, for example, how  issues of information privacy are found in the activities of  creation, processing, flows, access, and use, or the stages of  creation, production, distribution, access, use, and disposition in  relation to learning data.    While it is beyond the scope of this short paper to address how  each information policy area relates to each information activity  or stage in the information lifecycle, what follows provides some  examples of how these information policy areas draw attention to  activities that relate to learning analytics practice and policy.  Important discussion in the information policy area address:     Protection of individual records, including legal  frameworks for privacy protection such as FERPA and  HIPPA; attention to the ramifications of the failure of  anonymization techniques to keep records anonymous;  and invasions of privacy whether for law enforcement  efforts or by breaches of secruity    Monitoring and dataveillance [5], including collection  of data without participant knowledge or consent;  general surveillance of individual actions in public  and/or online [15]; information discovery through  connecting databases and/or data mining techniques  [12][22]    Access to information, including literacy relating to  reading, computing and technologies, and the digital  divide; transparency in government or other data  collection, use and disposition activities    Redress mechanisms for correction, removal or  amendment of records    Ownership of information, including copyright, patents,  trademarking, etc.    The following sections discuss these areas in relation to learning  analytics.   2. PROTECTION OF DATA RECORDS  AND INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY  Protection of learner privacy opens up a wide array of questions  about data across the information lifecycle, from what data should  be collected, to how it is stored, used, and disposed of. Policies on  record retention are undoubtedly present in educational  institutions, relating to legal requirements and social practices of  record keeping. For learning analytics, the question of what data is  collected has to be revisited as analytics can  conceivably   collect more than just in-class records, and can connect to more  than educational data. Policies in this area may be more about  what data are not to be collected than about collection of data, and  about keeping databases separate rather than connecting them. For  example, what policies should apply to connecting student aid  data to student performance data Or connecting foreign versus  domestic status to student data    The issue of connecting databasesor joining them in the  database management senseis becoming a major issue in  information policy areas because the safe harbor of  anonymization as a means of protecting individual identity is no  longer providing the protection it should. This big data problem  arises from  widespread data collection, and a general trend to  information discovery by combining data across collections.  Recent studies reveal how little data it takes to reidentify  individuals. Following the release of anonymized data on movie  recommendations made in Netflix, researchers Arvind Narayanan  and Vitaly Shmatikov were able to reidentify 68 percent of the  users by knowing only when a user rated a movie and the ratings  on two movies; with data on when and six ratings 99 percent of  users could be reidentified  (cited in [17]); similarly, researchers  at MIT found that the dates and locations of four credit card  purchases allowed identification of 90 percent of users in a dataset  of 1.1 million records [12].    These are issues that change the direction of both policy and law,  and they are appearing through analytics first. Writing in 2010,  Ohm [17] notes that    Nearly every information privacy law or regulation grants a  get-out-of-jail-free card to those who anonymize their data   the public policy debate  centers almost entirely on  squabbles over magical phrases like personally identifiable  information (PII) or personal data.  Prior to these  [reidentification/ deanonymization] studies, nobody would  have classified ZIP code, birth date, sex, or movie ratings as  PII. ([17], p. 1705)   Thus, while most of the discussion here is of using information  policy as a roadmap to learning analytics policy, each area can  inform the other.   Joining databases is also an issue in relation to ideas of freedom to  read and keeping borrower records private [10]. Learning  analytics implementations float the idea of connecting individual  records about library use to the outcomes on courses. Freedom to  read would suggest that these databases should not be connected,  and that general library borrowing and reading practices should be  kept private, including in relation to the course in question. The  ethical issue that arises is whether students borrowing from a  university library are to be granted the same protections or  considerations as individuals borrowing from a public library.      3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  GATHERING AND USE  Perhaps the biggest challenge will be transparency, in identifying  and making evident the kinds of information collected and their  use  perhaps even the ability for students to opt out of their use.  Educational institutions, many of which are government  supported, may need to set policy that addresses openness in a  way that discloses what data are collected, how they are used, etc.,  and in a way that is accessible  technically, intellectually  to the  relevant constituencies. Thus, educational settings that adopt  learning analytics may also find themselves setting policies about  how and when to convey this information to relevant  constituencies.   Approaching learning analytics from an information policy  perspective calls for greater emphasis on disclosure, and this in  turn may change the emphasis of systems development. For  instance, one of the relevant constituencies is the student  population that supplies this data. Considering information use in  the context of openness can influence learning analytics  development by establishing a higher value to providing learning  data back to students than aggregating such data for institutional  use. Where this value enters design, it can set a different policy  and practice perspective for learning analytics, one that  differentiates if from academic analytic initiatives. (For more on  values in design, see [13].)   Disclosure also has other ramifications. In particular it can place a  bureaucratic burden on educational institutions to consider the  impact of each new data stream on existing policy. This could  have a chilling effect on innovation and spontaneity in learning  analytics systems development; and it is also likely to tip the  balance to testing of data collection options to identify those with  repeatable and useful outcomes for educational practice. Policy  about research and test environments are then needed to balance  the needs of development and production, including policy to  safeguard conditions for innovation, e.g., by designating and  maintaining separate exploratory data repositories, and by  establishing short rather than long-term retention policies about  test data.  Along with disclosure about data collection and use,  communication in clear language, and opportunities for  amendment of records, freedom from surveillance draws attention  to the need to address whether and for what data individuals may  withhold consent for data collection. Moreover, while the  emphasis is normally on surveillance, i.e., top down,  organizational monitoring, not all surveillance comes from above.  As monitoring technologies have become more prevalent, they are  now found in the hands of students, and thus policies about  sousveillance [16] need to be considered. There are already issues  arising around student filming of lectures, raising questions about  intellectual property: Who owns the lecture Who owns its  distribution rights Ubiquitous recording technologies may even  be co-opted into educational practice, e.g., requiring students to  record interviews, events, etc. as part of the class discussion. This  should immediately open up institituional discussion and policy  around ownership, privacy, ethics and academic behavior.    With every case of information gathering comes the issue of  ownership. Copyright protects original works of authorship (not  ideas, systems, or methods), but within that realm transcripts of  conversations may be included [9]. While university policies may  already lay out the parameters of ownership of materials  generated in the pursuit of education, new ground may need to be  broken to understand the copyright of online conversations in an   educational context, and perhaps even the patenting process  associated with ideas generated in online forums.   4. ACCESS TO RECORDS  Information policy developments, and Freedom of Information/  Right to Information legislation, have generated an expectation  that stored data records that are not routinely disclosed can be  made available by request. These generates a need to manage  requests for student access to their records. Learning analytics  systems may need to implement means of record production in  anticipation of such requests, and indeed such systems may be the  means for production of such records. Thus, policies about  implementation must grapple early with the eventuality of a  freedom of information request.    Similarly, requests for data may come from outside the institution,  for example in compliance with the Patriot Act/Freedom Act.  Learning analytics systems may hold data on individuals that is  not in the student record. Such data may be requested, and  become part of a record that by policy or law must be shared with  agencies outside the university. Thus, policy needs to consider the  way new data streams from learning analytics can potentially end  up in student records.    5. AMENDMENT AND REMOVAL OF  RECORDS  Mistakes, data corruption, ineffective data practices, and  individual requests can all lead to the need to amend and/or  remove data records.  Where learning analytics data and systems  are involved in creating and generating these records, policies  need to address not only whether changes can be made and under  what circumstances, but also how data changes will be  communicated to record holders.   New analytic techniques may also generate new data, which may  be retroactively attached to existing records. For example, later  analyses may generate predictive statistics on a students  likelihood of success, perhaps with the benevolent intention of  identifiying ways to increase success. Where does such data  belong in the student record If these data are generated based on  records of graduated students, should such a score be entered  retroactively into student records Where amendment might  include such new data points, policy needs to address whether  such data is retroactively attached to records or are added only  from an official start date; and where such data may appear  prejudicial in future review, policy may be needed to limi the  lifespan of the data, e.g., removing data at graduation or at another  well-considered point in time or student progress.    6. CONCLUSION  Information policy has emerged as a field of inquiry over the last  20 years, responding to the increasing presence, availability, use  and misuse of data and information streams. As a field, it aims to  affect national level policies relevant to the information activities  identified in many disciplines. While most examples here have  been of US initiatives and acts, information policies are in place in  most countries, and often stem from initiatives in  intergovernmental agencies. This paper advocates for bringing the  information policy knowledge into learning analytics policy as  well as exploring how learning analytics can add to information  policy.     7.
