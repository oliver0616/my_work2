Categorizing discussion threads into topics can provide an  overview of the discussion, improve navigation of the forum, and  support replying to a representative sample of content related  posts. We investigate four different approaches to using topic  models to organize and present discussion posts, highlighting the  strength and weaknesses of each approach to support instructors.

INTRODUCTION  Searching and navigating Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)  discussion forums, composed of high volumes of participants and  posts, is a challenging task for instructors and TAs [8]. To address  this, most forums provide searching, discussion thread labeling  [4], and some use students upvote of popular posts to denote  their importance [3]. These strategies can be helpful if an  instructor is searching for a particular type of question/comment,  but in many cases instructors read forum posts to gain a general  sense of what their students are discussing. This is an important  goal for instructors as they try to address the particular needs and  interests of their students. Instructors might want to know if  students are struggling with the content, how they are discussing  ideas, or provide support to encourage students to work  collaboratively. This serves the main intent of forums as a place to  discuss ideas, course content, ask questions, answer problems and  build networks [4][8][11].    Currently if an instructor wants to know about forum discussions  they need to read large quantities of posts, but this is overly  burdensome. Topic modeling offers a novel way to reduce this  burden by grouping similar posts together by topic [1] and  providing a topic description of their content. Grouping posts by  topics for instructors can potentially provide holistic insights into  the types of discussions occurring. Prior work using topic models  on MOOC forum data has mostly taken a researcher perspective  to understand discussions, for example to study: evolution of  discussion structures [4], organization of MOOC resources [6],   topics linked to student attrition [10], or identify MOOC topic  discussions in social media [5]. More recently, however, there has  been growing interest in developing and presenting topic models  to instructors to support their teaching.  Chen and colleagues [2]  used topic models to help instructors review large quantities of  student reflection papers. Other work [Paepcke, personal  communication] focused on the use of word clouds to visualize  MOOC discussion topic models for instructor use. The current  study expands this work by exploring how different approaches to  build nave topic models highlight different features for MOOC  instructors.    2. STUDY FRAMING  This study explores and compares the utility of four different  approaches to creating topic models to support instructors in  navigating and reviewing MOOC discussion posts. It is the first  phase of a project to design visualizations of topic models and  assess their use with teachers. This initial work addresses the  research question: What potential information is offered to  instructors by different variations of topic models The first model  is a baseline using all posts. The second approach generates topic  models from pre-sorted posts grouped into content/non-content  categories. The third approach uses a second level of topic  modeling to further group posts into subtopics. The fourth  approach creates models based on weekly course segmentation.   3. METHODS AND RESULTS  Data was all 813 starting posts from the discussion forum of a  Medical Statistics MOOC offered in 2014. Starting posts were  used for modeling as they are a parsimonious way to examine the  range of topics discussed and common way to search through a  discussion forum [9][12]. The MALLET toolkit [7] with standard  stop word list was used to develop the topic models. Number of  topics (k) was varied to optimize comprehension. In each analysis,  posts were assigned to their most related topic. Models two  through four used posts pre-categorized as content or non-content  based on a previously developed and validated classifier [12].  The first model uses a traditional topic modeling approach,  including all posts as one corpus. A 20-topic model best  differentiated posts but was difficult to navigate given the large  number of topics to examine and quantity of posts within. To  explore ways of improving ease of navigation and interpretability,  the second approach assessed the potential of using topic models  on the discussion corpus after dividing it into content/non-content.  Ten topics were generated from content and non-content posts in  order to compare a total of 20 topics to the prior model. This  substantially improved the interpretability of the topics. For  instance, the terms quiz and explain appeared in all models.  The content/non-content model provided greater context to  understand these terms as quiz was contextualized within themes  surrounding conceptual questions vs. how to access the quiz. This  also improved navigability  instructors could select either content  or non-content, then compare 10 topics, as opposed to comparing  all 20.

ACM 978-1-4503-4870-6/17/03  http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3027385.3029486     SD=0.15 to M=0.36 SD=0.12 and M=0.35 SD=0.13, content/non- content respectively. The limitation of this approach is the large  number of posts within each topic (M=45). This may be time  consuming for an instructor to review and could overlook smaller  topics within these broad topics. To address this, the third and  fourth models explored different approaches to further classifying  posts within a topic. The traditional solution would be to increase  k (# of topics) to reduce the number of posts within each topic;  however, this puts a cognitive burden on the instructor to compare  a greater number of unorganized topics. As an alternative, the  third design makes use of nested subtopics within the larger topic  to increase k but group related topics. Syphoning topics into  subtopics allows instructors to choose from a reduced list of topics  that open a list of related subtopics which link to posts. Figure 1  provides an example of this navigation using 5 subtopics.         The advantage is that instead of viewing 50 discrete topics,  nesting provides instructors with a choice among 10 topics with 5  related subtopics in each. Posts within the subtopics are ordered  by topic contribution providing instructors with easy access to the  most representative post from each subtopic. Grouping related  subtopics and listing their descriptor words can provide an  overview of the discussion without the need to read individual  posts. Instructors could use subtopic representative posts to gain  insight into the variety of questions asked. If reviewing past  courses for future improvements, this overview approach could be  beneficial to look at trends in problem areas or compare courses.  For example, an instructor could view all topics related to  algebraic computation difficulties across course chapters and  design an additional lesson to address it. A limitation to this  approach is that posts in a topic span a variety of weeks in the  course (see figure 1); however, instructors may want to see  discussion topics as they relate to their presentation of the  material. The fourth approach addresses this issue of temporality  by grouping posts according to the course schedule, creating  subtopics for each weeks posts (see figure 2). Instructors could  use a weekly summary of the discussion with representative posts   from different topics, or to address unresolved questions before  moving on to a new lesson. Additionally, listing posts by topic  groups similar questions highlighting repetition. Instructors can  quickly link questions to a prior answer post or create an   announcement that addresses a series of similar questions.  Limitations of this model are that the total number of posts change  weekly impacting the optimal number of k topics, and it is  difficult to view course wide trends.    4. DISCUSSION  This study contributes to the important question of how to make  the benefits of topic models useful to a practitioner audience of  instructors and their unique needs. Assessing the four different  approaches to grouping and classifying discussion posts using  topic models highlighted their unique benefits and drawback for  different instructional purposes. Results indicate organizing topic  models into content/non-content improves topic interpretability  with small gains in the relatedness of topic to posts. The creation  of subtopics within larger topics improved manageability of  interpretation and ease of use by reducing the number of topic  comparisons and grouping related subtopics. Model 3 highlights  the advantages of seeing topics across the course while model 4  highlights the advantages of maintaining the time sequence of the  course, representing a tradeoff between the ability to explore  either temporal features or broader concept features depending on  instructional needs. In the next phase of the project, these findings  will be used to design visualizations of the topic model designs  and assess their usability with instructors.   5. REFERENCES  [1] Blei, D. 2012.
