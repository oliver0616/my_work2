INTRODUCTION  There is an increasing interest in the analysis of both students   writing [3] and the temporal aspects of learning data [5, 25]. In   order for text-based analytics to support higher level learning    such as the sharing of ideas together, or the communication and   critical analysis of those ideas  analysis of data with a temporal   or sequential character is necessary [24, 25]. In the context of   writing, this analysis might include data regarding: writing   processes, the behaviours they involve, and the outputs they   produce (for example, note taking, drafting, copy-editing); or of   sequences, both of events (for example, the co-occurrence of   inserting a citation and inserting language from the referred to   paper), or of linguistic information within a text (for example,   argumentative moves that recur in consistent sequential forms).   These analyses are further complicated by the potential for them   to be multi-modal (for example, across online and paper-based   documents), and multi-agent (for example, including interaction   with peers, tutors, and others). This paper first discusses extant   literature on what we characterise as temporal writing analytics   (2) highlighting cohesion (2.1) and rhetorical move (2.2)   analyses. We illustrate by our developing work on a corpus   annotated with rhetorical moves and their analysis (4).   Secondly, based on literature on temporal analysis of writing,   developing analysis and sequence pattern mining, and our own   first-hand experience of sequential analysis, we propose four   approaches to pre-process and four approaches to mine frequent   sequences and dispersion of rhetorical moves in authentic student   writing, highlighting their potential for  analysis of features of that   writing  (4.2-4.3).   2. SEQUENCE AND PROCESS ANALYSES  OF STUDENT WRITING  A small body of work has explored sequence and process features   of student writing. For example, to study writing processes,   analysis has been conducted on the editing features in Google   Docs to investigate the revisioning and editing processes students   undertake in writing tasks [4, 27, 41], with similar work in an   automated writing tutor tool [37]. In other work, researchers have   explored the ways that topic modelling techniques, and social   network analyses, can be used to investigate the emergence,   divergence, and convergence of voices throughout a document   [10], describing an essays flow.   Similarly, argument mining refers to the automatic identification   of the argumentative structure contained within a piece of natural   language text [26]. The presence and combination of specific   elements of arguments (e.g. premise, argumentative move, claim)   are fundamental to definitions of argument and the   computational modelling of argumentation [e.g., 15, 45], thus   lending itself to sequence analysis for identification of argument   structures and arguments in use through the analysis of argument   constituent parts [e.g., 28].   Obviously the syntactic dependencies, represented as sequences of   parts of speech in essays, can also be used to infer structures  for   example, causal relations [18], or term-definition pairs [14]    present in a text, with the additional analysis of temporal   references in a text supporting identification of question-answer   pairs [2], and types of discourse [38]. Association rule and   sequence mining approaches have been similarly used to identify   relationships between constructs in a text [for example, 1, 20, 35],   and to detect erroneous sentences [42]. Linguistics research has   used these approaches to investigate the ways that language is   structured, and used in everyday contexts.   2.1 Text Cohesion  In research specifically on student written products, a limited   body of work has investigated the sequential structure of those   texts using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Moreover, higher quality paragraphs were easier to rate   (presumably because they best exemplified the rhetorical structure   of the intended paragraph type), and paragraph-position specific   information regarding body paragraphs may inform pedagogic   strategies [32].    In addition to textual indicators being used to identify paragraph-  position, indicators can be constructed with small but significant   predictive value for ratings of introductory (r2=0.25), body   (r2=0.10), and concluding (r2=0.11) paragraph quality [36]. This   analysis indicated that good introductions tended to be longer,   using more infrequently occurring words, plus indicators of   temporal cohesion (consistent tense, aspect, etc.) and causal   cohesion (i.e. indicators of how events and actions are connected).   Body paragraphs, then, displayed deep vocabulary alongside   locational nouns, more varied sentence structures, and an internal   cohesion. Finally, conclusions express more specific ideas using   accessible, yet varied syntax. This pattern is consistent with the   rhetorical goal of concluding an essay with a straightforward   summary of ones idea that provides the reader with a big   picture understanding [36].    2.2 The Rhetorical Structure of a Text  That work [36] hypothesised that, for example, relationships   identified in introductory paragraphs indicate authors previewing   of arguments and provision of reasons for their position.   However, the measures used provide limited insight into   rhetorical structure. Indeed, building on this work, Crossley et al.,   [12] further analysed the use of key n-grams (unigrams, bigrams,   and trigrams) in poor and high quality introductory, body, and   concluding paragraphs, by grouping the key n-grams into clusters   of rhetorical, grammatical, syntactic, and cohesion features   [12]. Across all three paragraph positions, rhetorical features were   identified as most important, indicating the potential of analysing   rhetorical n-grams within paragraph-contexts to inform automated   approaches to assessing whole-essay quality [12].   An alternative approach to understanding sub-patterns within texts   has emerged from work informed by Swales analysis of   rhetorical moves in academic writing [43]. In research paper   introductions, these moves mark the: introduction of a topic and   its background; raising questions, contrasts or the need to extend   the topic; and establishing the contribution or novelty of the given   text (its niche or the gap it occupies). Swales thus offers a   template for thinking about the kinds of linguistic patterns   (rhetorical moves) that occur in texts, where in texts they might   appear and in what kind of sequence. Specifically, we would   anticipate that texts make moves between: (1) introducing topic   background; (2) establishing a space within that topic through its   critique, contrast, discussion of its potential for extension, etc.;   and (3) filling that space by taking a particular position or stance   with regard to it. These moves might be dispersed both within a   particular section of text (i.e., we would expect more 1 moves   earlier, and more 3 moves later in an introduction), and within   particular sub-section-sequences such as individual paragraphs.   Thus, we might expect paragraphs to introduce background (move   1), evaluate that information (move 2), and point to the potential   for future research (move 3). In related work on Argumentative   Zoning, location is used as a feature in order to determine the   rhetorical move being made in a scientific text [17, 44].   One tool that has investigated automated approaches to the   detection of these moves at a sentence level, and specifically in a   higher education context, is the Intelligent Academic Discourse   Evaluator (IADE) [7], research on which has demonstrated the   variation in the weight of particular rhetorical moves in different   disciplinary texts. Of course, analysis of rhetorical moves above   the sentence level (or, moves as comprising many sentences) is   important too [6, 13], and indeed a tool based on these rhetorical   moves has been developed to give feedback on the moves within   abstracts [13], with a newer tool (the Research Writing Tool    RWT) developed to support students in reflecting on the rhetorical   moves that should be present in each section of their text, in their   disciplinary context [8, 9].    2.3 Summary: Developing Analytic  Approaches  Across the body of work reviewed above that explores this issue,   analysis has indicated that sections of a text (for example,   introduction, body, conclusion) contain different linguistic   features, and that the presence of these features may be an   indicator of the appropriateness (or quality) of those sections. That   is, good introductions tend to have particular characteristics as   compared to other text sections and poorer quality introductions.   Across this work, the rhetorical structure of a text has emerged as   a particularly salient feature. Extant analyses of student writing   have investigated the weight of particular rhetorical moves, or   textual features, in sections of a text. These analyses have been   related to: human assessments of the type of text observed (i.e.,   whether it was introduction, body, or concluding text);   disciplinary genre; and  in a few cases  the quality of the text   observed. This analysis has tended to focus on describing the   nature of particular text sections, but less on relating these to   assessment criteria judgements, or feedback to students.   Moreover, extant prior analyses have not, to our knowledge,   extended to the potential of sequence and process mining   approaches for understanding textual data.    3. SEQUENCE AND PROCESS MINING  ON STUDENT DATA  Sequential mining and process mining are techniques that have   been used to identify patterns in educational datasets by   considering the order of students actions in learning system   activity logs [21, 29, 33]. Examples of sequential pattern   extraction and modelling have examined the temporality of   students actions in order to gain insights into: the development of   strategies, or to differentiate or group students who show similar   behaviours [21]; students strategies [e.g., 31], students profiles   [e.g., 34], conversation patterns [e.g., 30], the temporal evolution   of students strategies [e.g., 22], or to compare cohorts of students   by identifying the actions that differentiate them according to their   expertise [19]. To a lesser extent, sequence mining techniques   have also been used to focus on understanding the evolution of the   artefacts created by the students [e.g., 29, 34].    The potential of these techniques for learning analytics is that   analysing sequences of events can be a quite generic approach to   consider the temporality for distilling interesting patterns where   the sequence of occurrence (absence or dispersion) of certain   event can be crucial for learning. We propose that such techniques   could have potential to provide insights into student writing, and   in the light of the above literature analysis, to provide feedback on   the rhetorical structure of a text. Although, similar sequence or   process mining techniques have, to our knowledge, not yet been   applied to student writing, some techniques applied to event data     could easily be operationalised to undercover patterns in texts. To   summarise, the preliminary work reported here motivates a   theoretically sound rationale for the application of sequence   mining to student writing, which we hope other researchers can   use as a reference, and establish the steps needed to prepare data   to maximise the opportunities of finding useful insights.    4. APPROACH  This section presents work analysing sequences and dispersion of   moves in student writing. Below, we illustrate our approaches for   preparing (pre-processing) and analysing (mining) the dataset   based on our specific case of rhetorical moves in student writing.   However, our claim is that the general approach described is   applicable to other contexts, and is agnostic regarding the kind of   analytic approach taken to identifying moves in a text. We   finalise the section with an illustrative example of cohort analysis   of rhetorical moves dispersion.   4.1 Dataset: Annotation of Rhetorical Moves  Analysis is underway on a dataset from multiple disciplinary   genres (law, accounting, and biology), annotated using the Xerox   Incremental Parsers (XIP) instantiation in tools for feedback on   analytical academic writing [23, 39, 40]. Within the Academic   Writing Analytics (AWA) tool developed at UTS, the analytic   parser is designed to detect rhetorical steps, inspired by Swales   moves, that indicate specific rhetorical functions falling under the   general moves described above. These steps are then  through   AWA  highlighted within a submitted document, in order to give   students feedback on the rhetorical structure of their text.    The analytical module labels thus include: Summarising issues   (describing the articles plan, goals, and conclusions) (S),   describing Background knowledge (B), Contrasting ideas (C),   Emphasising important ideas (E), mentioning Novel ideas (N),   pointing out Surprising facts, results, etc. (P), describing an open   Question or insufficient knowledge (Q), and recognising research   Trends (T). Thus, as in Figure 1, each sentence in a document is   labelled with none, or with one or more of these steps.        Figure 1  An Example AWA Report   4.2 Dataset Preparation Approaches  Texts submitted to AWA are processed, with the marked up   documents displayed to students in a report which highlights   individual sentences that display indicators of particular rhetorical   moves. In order to process the student texts the original files (docx   or pdf) were cleaned to remove: student IDs and names; headings;   preface (such as cover sheets, or the essay prompt); end-matter   (such as reference lists); and figures, tables, and captions. In   addition, lists were converted to paragraph text. These texts were   analysed using the AWA tool, with outputs in JSON format    Thus, documents submitted to AWA can be represented as sets of   ordered sentences, with each sentence annotated with particular   features  including which (if any) rhetorical moves it appears to   exemplify. These texts may then be represented using a few   different approaches, with important implications for the unit of   analysis  for example, whether to treat the whole-text as a single   unit, or to analyse meaningful sub-sections (such as the paragraph,   or headed-section).    Essays can thus be represented as ordered lists of sentence-types.   We can consider all the sentences or rather only those sentences   for which moves are identified (i.e., ignoring blank sentences)    levels 1 and 2 in Figure 2. In addition, the repetition of   particular features (including blank sentences) might be   collapsed into a single item, or treated separately. In addition,   representations may capture elements of the process of writing a   text  the key sections or elements that a text is built up from, for   example, the paragraph, or introduction/body/conclusion  as in   the right most two representations in Figure 2 (levels 3 and 4). In   this latter model, sentences, then, might either be treated as   ordered or unordered elements within the constituent parts. That   is, they can be treated as components of the sequences seen in the   left most columns, or treated such that the order of the items   within the sub-section does not matter.     Figure 2  Levels for Representing/Aggregating Students   Writing: 1) Sentences (all), 2) Sentences marked as moves, 3)   Paragraphs, and 4) Sections   4.3 Analysis (Mining) Approaches  Given the relationship between the XIP identified rhetorical   moves within the AWA tool, and Swales rhetorical moves, our   hypothesis is that methods to treat the sequences of rhetorical   moves temporally may yield insight and aid us in designing   actionable feedback for learners. Specifically, we are orienting our   analysis around four approaches to the data analysis (which  as   described below  may not be mutually exclusive):    Analysis of Sub-sequences commonly occurring throughout a text    for example, the recurrence of background, contrast,   novel moves in sequences indicating a typical analysis style   sequence. Analysis based on this approach  for example using   TraMineRs analysis of frequent sub-sequences [16]  could   indicate patterns in the ways in which groups of texts use   particular structures in their text as indicated by their patterns of   rhetorical move. This analysis could be conducted on any of the   levels of data segmentation in Figure 2.   Analysis of Dispersion or weighting of moves across sub-sections   of a text (e.g. introduction, body, conclusion)  for example, a   tendency for background moves to appear more in the   introduction, with emphasizing moves more in a conclusion.   This type of analysis could also indicate the dispersion of sub-  sequences throughout a text. Analysis based on this approach   could indicate the ways that texts are structured to show how   sections of text fulfil particular functions. Analysis of this sort   could be conducted on levels 3 & 4 of representing the data, as it   requires a way for weighting the moves within particular sub-  sections.     Analysis of Associations between moves that co-occur in   meaningful sub-sections of text (e.g. the paragraph level), in   non-ordered ways. For example, a tendency for novel and   surprise moves to co-occur. This type of analysis could   indicate that particular sub-sections of text have   characteristic moves  but that these moves can occur in a   variety of orders. Analysis of this sort could be conducted on   any of the levels of representing the data.    Analysis of Processes of moves occurring over a whole text    for example, a text might include a cycle of sections   weighted towards a particular move (as in the dispersion   analysis), in sequences  for example, more background   moves, followed by more question moves, followed by   more novel, although within each element other moves   might occur. For example, we might see a repeated pattern   of shifts from mostly background steps to mostly question   steps, to mostly trends steps, as in discussion papers that point to   emerging research directions based on questions in the earlier   literature. Analysis of this sort could be conducted on any (1-4) of   the levels of representing the data.   4.4 Illustrative Example: Cohort Analysis of  Rhetorical Moves Dispersion  Here we present a preliminary example of the potential of   analysing the dispersion of rhetorical moves in students texts   Figure 3 shows the rhetorical moves for 6 students texts of two   cohorts: those that received high distinction (HD) and pass (P)   marks. For illustrative purpose, this simple visualisation shows all   the rhetorical moves of the texts divided at a section level, with   each students text arbitrarily divided in quantiles to explore the   dispersion of the rhetorical moves.    The HD texts present a larger mix of rhetorical moves,   particularly in the first and last quintiles (see particularly Q1 and   Q2 for texts B and C). Notably, they all commenced with an   EMPHASIS move followed by a combination of SUMMARY,   CONTRAST sentences and other moves. In Q4 and Q5 these texts   also showed a quite varied combination of moves. By contrast, the   P texts, overall, showed fewer, and more dispersed, rhetorical   moves. Notably, the three P examples present some moves in the   middle of the text (at Q3) which are not observed in the HD texts.   Additionally, these texts include a smaller range of moves either   at the beginning (Q1 for F) or the end (Q5 in D and E) of the text.   This illustrates the potential insights that can be gained by   analysing sequencing and dispersion of rhetorical moves. Finding   patterns of this type in larger cohorts may be useful to generate   the means for providing automated or hybrid feedback to the   students about their writing.    5. CONCLUSIONS  This paper has sought to present an account of sequential and   process analyses of writing, using data from our own research to   highlight the ways in which student-texts might be treated using   these approaches. In doing so, we foreground the potential of   different types of analysis and data representation. There is   potential to draw on these analyses to feedback to students and   instructors regarding the structure of their written work. Analyses   are ongoing to demonstrate this potential empirically.   6. REFERENCES  [1] Bchet, N., Cellier, P., Charnois, T. and Crmilleux, B.   2012.
