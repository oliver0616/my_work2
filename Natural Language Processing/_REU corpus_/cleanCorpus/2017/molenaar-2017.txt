This quasi-experimental study investigates the effects of a  LA-ET on the development of students arithmetic skills over one  schoolyear. Children learning in a traditional paper & pencil  condition were compared to learners using a LA-ET on tablet  computers in grade 4. The educational technology combined  teacher dashboards (extracted analytics) and class and individually  paced assignments (embedded analytics). The results indicated that  children in the LA-ET condition made significantly more progress  on arithmetic skills in one schoolyear compared to children in the  paper & pencil condition.

INTRODUCTION  Even though the recent influx of tablets in primary education is  based on the vision that educational technology empowered with  learning analytics (LA-ET) will revolutionize education, empirical  results supporting this claim are scarce [1]. Specifically, these  advances are expected to enhance the effectiveness of education [2,  3]. The present study investigates the effects of an LA_ET on the  development of childrens arithmetic skills compared to a  traditional paper & pencil learning environment in grade 4 of  primary education. Most research on effectiveness of educational  technologies entails so-called individually paced technologies: i.e.  these technologies adapt pace and difficulty of assignments to  students skills. Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) and  Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are both examples of   individually paced technologies [3]. A meta-analysis evidenced  that comprehensive blended learning scenarios, in which CAI or  ITS are combined with classroom activities, elicit larger learning  gains, compared to using educational technologies in isolation [3].  Yet, both CAI and ITS are not often used in blended scenarios  combining teacher-lead instructions, class-paced and individually- paced practice. This can be explained by the fact that CAI and ITS  are both individually paced, which entails that students learn and  advance at different speed. For teachers, it is difficult to connect  individually paced practice with classroom-wide activities that are  meaningful for all students. Extracted analytics in the form of  dashboards can support teachers to view class wide as well as  students individual  progress. This can function as a bridge to  combine class-paced activities (instruction and practice) and  individually paced practice.   2. THE PRESENT STUDY  Hence teaching with LA-ET can support blended educational  scenarios in primary education. These scenarios combine teacher- lead instructions, class-paced and individually-paced practice. In  this study, the learning analytics empowered educational  technology provided teachers with dashboards that gave an  overview of class and student progress. Moreover, individual  practice was adjusted to the students current  performance level.  This quasi-experimental study investigates the effect of  using this  LA-ET on the development of students arithmetic skills in grade 4  over one schoolyear. Children learning in a traditional paper &  pencil condition were compared to children using a LA-ET on  tablet computers. We expect that on average, skill development will  be larger for the students who work with LA-ET compared to the  paper & pencil condition. This hypothesis is based on positive  effects of earlier CAI and ITS studies [3] and research indicating  the benefits of applying CAI in blended learning scenarios [3].  Additionally, dashboards (extracted analytics) are expected to  support teachers to connect teacher-lead instructions, class-paced  and individually-paced practice, which can also enhance students  arithmetics skill development.    3. METHOD  3.1 Participants  In this study, 41 schools participated, with 1579 children in grade  4. Informed consent was obtained from the schools before students  were allowed to participate. Students data was stored anonymously.    3.2 Learning analytics empowered technology  The LA-ET used in this study is called Snappet. This technology  is used for both arithmetic and language education across schools  in the Netherlands. The practice activities are comparable between  conditions as the arithmetic assignments in the LA-ET are   Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The  technology operates on tablet computers and features both  embedded and extracted learning analytics. Class and individually  paced assignments are available and children receive immediate  feedback after finishing each assignment. Individually paced  assignments are adjusted automatically to students current  performance level. Teachers have access to 3 different types of  dashboards with which they can monitor class and student progress.   3.3 MEASURMENTS  3.3.1 Arithmetic skill development and ability levels   The Dutch national standardized arithmetic assessment, CITO  Rekenen-Wiskunde 2.0 [Arithmetic-Mathematics] was used to  measure childrens arithmetic. Childrens raw scores on these  assessments were thus converted into national standardized normed  ability scores that showed the degree to which the student masters  arithmetic skills.   3.4 Procedure  The data collection took place over one full schoolyear from June  2015 to June 2016. The standardized test scores (CITO) are from  June 2015 (Time 1) and June 2016 (Time 2).   3.5 Data-analysis  To examine the effect of LA-ET on students arithmetic skill  development over one schoolyear, a random effects model was with  Time (Time 1 / Time 2) as within-subject-factor, Condition (LA- ET / Control) as between-subject-factor, and Subject and School as  random effects.   4. RESULTS  Analysis of arithmetic skills showed a significant effect of  Condition and an interaction effect of Time X Condition.  Disregarding Condition there was a significant increase in scores  over time, t(1427.7) = 34.33, p < .001. The students in both  conditions made significant progress during the year. Disregarding  Time, no significant difference was found between the LA-ET and  the Control condition, t(39.3) = -1.83, p = 0.13. Students in both  conditions scored equally high on arithmetic skills. The interaction  effect between Time and Condition was significant, t(1427.6) = - 8.15, p < 0.001. Students in the LA-ET condition made more  progress on arithmetic skills than students in the control condition  (see Table 1 and Figure 1).     Table 1. Arithmetic Skills per Condition    Time 1 Time 2 Progress    N M SD N M SD    LA-ET 742 80.39 14.68 778 94.64 12.54 14.25   Control 730 81.66 13.41 727 92.20 11.76 10.54                              5. DISCUSSION  In this study, we examined the effect of an LA-ED with both  embedded and extracted analytics on the development of arithmetic  skills over one schoolyear. The results indicated that children in the  LA-ET condition made significantly more progress on arithmetic  skills in one schoolyear compared to children in the paper & pencil  condition. This supports the notion that educational technologies  that translate data into actionable information for teachers indeed  support student learning. Moreover, in this study we learned that  educational technologies combining extracted and embedded  learning analytics did indeed support blended education scenarios  including teacher-lead instructions, class-paced and individually- paced practice. However, many variations in blended scenarios  were noticed, which stresses the need for advanced efforts to  balance embedded analytics and extracted analytics in such a way  that system strengths and human strengths together optimally  support learning in learning analytics empowered technologies in  primary education.   6.
