Multilevel   analyses of 208,057 fourth grade students in 40 countries showed   that clustering students in schools by past achievement was linked   to higher reading achievement, consistent with the benefits of   customized, targeted instruction. Meanwhile, students had higher   reading achievement with greater differences (variances) among   classmates past achievement, reading attitudes, or family SES;   these results are consistent with the view that greater student   differences yield more help opportunities (higher achievers help   lower achievers, so that both learn), and foster learning from their   different resources, attitudes and behaviors. Also, a student had   higher reading achievement when classmates had more resources   (SES, home educational resources, reading attitude, past   achievement), suggesting that classmates shared their resources and   helped one another. Modeling of non-linear relations and   achievement subsamples of students supported the above   interpretations. Principals can use these results and a simpler   version of this methodology to re-allocate students and resources   into different course sections at little cost to improve students   reading achievement.

INTRODUCTION  As classmates interactions with each student differ, their effects   differ across students, so some arrangements of students into   classrooms yield superior learning overall compared to others.  For   example, grouping students by ability (tracking) is a common but   controversial education policy. Past studies of tracking has yielded   mixed results (positive effects: e.g., [1]; negative effects: e.g., [2];    Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are   not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies  bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

To explain these   contradictory results, we propose that the impact of tracking on   student achievement differs across levels (across schools vs. within   school), differs across types of classmate resources (past   achievement, reading attitude, family socio-economic status [SES])   and depends on a students own academic ability. Armed with this   knowledge and methodology, school principals can analyze their   data and use evidence-based arrangements of students into course   sections for superior learning instead of idiosyncratic systems (e.g.,   gender balance, parent requests, etc.) [4].     Data or analytic limitations might also account for some conflicting   results. While some schools track openly, other schools do so   quietly without a public tracking policy, even though students can   often recognize different achievement patterns across groups [5].   Hence, we examine the distribution of students by their actual past   achievement, instead of deferring to incomplete school declarations   of tracking [6].  Analytic limitations of past studies include omitted   variable bias, multi-collinearity, and failure to model the nested   data structure of students within classes within countries [7, 8].    To disentangle the effects of different types of tracking on reading   achievement, this study considers different levels of factors and   extends past research on tracking in four ways through analyses of   208,057 fourth grade primary school students in 40 countries.   (Many primary schools track their students, some as early as first   grade [9].) First, we examine how tracking students both across   schools (school-level) and across classes within schools (class-  level) affects reading achievement. Second, we examine how both   the amount and variation in different types of classmate resources   (past achievement, reading attitude, family socio-economic status   [SES]) are related to a students reading achievement. Third, we   analyze whether these relations differ across students with different   levels of past reading achievement. Lastly, we overcome the   statistical limitations of past studies through representative   sampling, inclusion of central variables, structured sets of   variables, and multilevel analyses. By understanding how tracking   operates, this study can help explain different tracking effects and   inform school policies on allocation of students into different   course sections to improve student learning.    2. TRACKING MECHANISMS  Under a tracking policy, students with similar past academic   achievement are grouped together for instruction. Whether tracking   raises or reduces student achievement depends on (a) the impact of   student similarities vs. differences and (b) whether classmates   compete or share resources.   2.1 Student Similarities vs. Differences  Education administrators can track students by placing those with   similar academic competences together, separating them from other   mailto:Permissions@acm.org http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3027385.3027439   students with higher or lower levels of past academic achievement.   Or, they may mix together students with different past   achievements.   2.1.1 Clusters of similar students  Students with similar academic competences can be assigned   together to the same school (academic or vocational streaming) or   to the same classes within a school (course-by-course tracking) [1].   Grouping similar students together can improve their learning by   enabling teachers to customize instruction to similar students,   capitalizing on student preferences to interact with and help similar   peers and enacting self-fulfilling prophecies of their labels and   norms [10].   When facing students with similar academic competences,   educators can customize the curriculum, lessons, teaching   materials, and teaching pace to the needs of each group of similar   students, which can improve their learning (customized instruction)   [11]. In contrast, when the competences of students differ widely,   teachers may focus on the learning needs of a subset of students to   the detriment of other students with much higher or much lower   competences [12]. Such customized instruction is easier for a   streamed school with similar students rather than for a tracked class   with similar students (but different students across classes) [10]. In   a streamed school, teachers design lessons for all students within a   small range of competences [4]. In contrast, tracking within a   school requires much more teacher time and effort to create lessons   for classes of students at different competences [11]. Hence, we   expect instruction customization to occur more often and improve   student achievement more in streamed schools than in other schools   (with or without internal tracking of classes).   As students often prefer to interact with others who are similar to   themselves, those with similar academic competences might be   more likely than others to interact, befriend, and help one another   to learn, compared to dissimilar others (homophily bias) [13]. As a   result, academically similar students in streamed schools might be   more likely to help one another and contribute to a school-wide   community culture of mutual support, compared to students in non-  streamed schools [14]. (While academically similar classmates in   tracked classes within a non-streamed schools might help one   another more, they might be less helpful to academically different   schoolmates in other classes.)    Although students placed in schools or classes labeled as high-  achieving might benefit from self-fulfilling prophecies by enacting   high expectations and norms (assimilation) [15], students labeled   as low-achieving might correspondingly suffer. Teachers and   parents of students in schools labeled as high-achieving typically   have high expectations of them, which students often internalize   [16]. As a result, these students, their teachers and their parents tend   to invest more time, effort and other resources to improve their   learning, compared to those in non-streamed schools [17].    Assimilation effects might be stronger when tracking within a   school rather than streaming across schools. When students are   tracked within a school, teachers can devote more attention, effort   and other resources to students in higher tracks than to students in   lower tracks [18]. This unequal distribution of teacher resources not   only increases the gap between high- and low-achieving students   but its unfairness can demoralize low-achieving students; as a   result, the drop in the academic performance of low-achieving   students might exceed the gain in that of high-achieving students,   thereby yielding lower overall academic performance [14].    In contrast, the negative effects of assimilation and demoralization   might be weaker for students within a streamed school.  As   academic comparisons with other schools are more distant from   students and teachers immediate experiences, such labels might   have less impact on their behaviors, especially as they acclimate to   their streamed school environment [14]. (However, such labels can   still influence parents and attract teachers to reputable schools in   education systems with open markets for hiring teachers [unlike   school systems like South Korea that randomly rotate teachers to   different schools every five years [14].) Furthermore, students   within a school share the same label, so teachers and staff are less   likely to treat students differently [18]. As a result, these students   are more likely to view their teachers as fair, to be less demoralized,   and show higher overall academic performance compared to   students in schools with tracked classes.   Hence, streamed schools might have more benefits from   customized instruction and homophily, and less harm from   assimilation and demoralization, compared to schools with tracked   classes. As many schools systems do not explicitly stream their   schools, we operationalized the degree of streaming across schools   with a school clustering by past achievement measure (ratio of   student past achievement variance across schools over total   variance of past achievement in a country) [18]. Hence, we propose   the following hypothesis:   H-1. In education systems with greater school clustering by   past achievement, students have higher academic   achievement than otherwise.     2.1.2 Mixing different students  While clustering similar ability students together aids instruction   customization and capitalizes on homophily, mixing different   ability students together can facilitate helping behaviors and   learning from schoolmates/classmates with different experiences.   Mixed classes offer more possible pairs of a higher-achieving   student helping a lower-achieving student (help opportunities).   Helping benefits both the recipient who receives additional   information and explanation, and the giver who often learns more   by re-organizing and elaborating his or her knowledge to give a   suitable explanation to the recipient [19]. Unlike clustering which   operates across schools, help opportunities occur primarily in direct   interactions among classmates.    H-2a. When classmates have greater variance in their past   achievements, a student has higher academic   achievement.    Compared to less diverse groups, more diverse groups often have   weaker interpersonal relations, more disagreements and less early   learning, but their greater range of experiences and resolution of   disagreements can increase their later learning [20]. Due to   homophily bias within a group, members often categorize   themselves into subgroups based on similarity (similar to ingroup   members and different from outgroup members, social   categorization) [21]. People trust ingroup members more,   cooperate with them more often, and have better relationships with   them, compared to outgroup members. Moreover, diverse   groupmates often have unfamiliar ideas, attitudes, and experiences   [22] that can conflict, thereby igniting disagreements that hinder   interpersonal relations initially [21]). Thus, less diverse groups   often initially function better than more diverse groups do [20].    However, diverse groups different ideas and disagreements can   legitimize different opinions, thereby stimulating group members   to pay attention, share more ideas, and reduce premature consensus   [23]. Group members' diverse views also help them recognize flaws   and correct them to yield better ideas [24]. If diverse groupmates   can reconcile their different views, resolve their disagreements, and     integrate their information, they can create and learn new ideas   [25]. Lastly, divergent views can stimulate a group to reflect and   improve on its own functioning [26]. Thus, over longer time   periods, diverse groups produce ideas that are more diverse and   learn more compared to homogeneous groups [27]. As these   students have shared a classroom for several months, we focus on   the long-term effects of diversity. Also, many countries do not have   much racial diversity across classmates, so we examine diversity of   classmates family SES and propose the following hypothesis.     H-2c. When classmates have greater variance in their family   SES, a student has higher academic achievement.    Greater differences among classmates increase the extremes of   diametric opposites, which can draw attention to them and aid   learning. Consider two classes whose students reading attitudes   have the same mean but greater variance in the second class than   the first. As reading attitude extremes are likely greater in the   second class than the first [8], the second class likely has both the   student with the best reading attitude (let us call her Heidi) and the   one with the worst (Lola). Heidis concrete behaviors embody her   reading attitude (e.g., reads many books; tells their stories by acting   them) and yield beneficial consequences (high reading quiz scores;   smiles at her graded quizzes; teacher praises her, reading awards,   etc.). In contrast, Lola rarely reads (I never read books theyre   boring), has low reading quiz scores, frowns at her graded quizzes   and so on.    As extremes, Heidi and Lola mutually highlight their differences   (contrasting cases), thereby attracting and focusing more attention   on the two of them than on either one alone or on classmates with   smaller reading attitude differences (focusing function, Schwartz &   Bransford, 1998). This focusing function helps classmates include   important differences and omit unnecessary information from their   working memories (cognitive load theory) [28], which are smaller   in young children than in adults [29]. As contrasting cases of people   rather than abstract ideas, Heidi and Lola serve as detailed reference   points for inferences about students in the continuum between them   (cognitive reference point reasoning) [30]. Rather than observing   other students or either Heidi or Lola alone, a student who focuses   on both of them can create a network of their contrasting reading   attitudes and related information in his or her short-term working   memory (hippocampus) and then encode it into his or her long-term   memory (cerebral cortex) [29], thereby learning effectively and   efficiently about reading attitude, remembering it reliably, and   acting on it accordingly to learn more than otherwise [31]. Hence,   we propose this hypothesis.     H-2b. When classmates have greater variance in their reading   attitudes, a student has higher academic achievement.    2.2 Classmates Compete vs. Share Resources  The impact of tracking on student achievement also depends on the   extent to which classmates compete or share resources. When   competing with classmates with greater cognitive, social and   material resources in a zero-sum game, a student could have lower   academic achievement. Classmates can serve as a collective ruler   against which to judge a students relative competence   (comparative reference-group view). When surrounded by lower-  achieving classmates, a student often has greater confidence in his   or her competence (self-concept), expectation of future success,   motivation, and academic achievement (social comparison) [32].   Conversely, higher-achieving classmates can demoralize a student,   reduce his or her self-concept, lower future expectations, and yield   lower academic achievement.     H-3. When classmates have a higher mean past academic   achievement, a student has lower academic   achievement.    In this social comparison view, tracking benefits lower-achieving   students at the expense of higher achieving students.   On the other hand, classmates, especially high-achieving ones, can   help a student learn directly or indirectly [33]. Classmates can   directly help a student by sharing information. For example, a   higher-achieving classmate can help a student correctly spell an   unfamiliar word.    A classmate can also help students learn indirectly through   motivation or norms. For example, a classmate can dramatically   enact a scene from a storybook, which can entice and motivate   other students to discuss it and learn about it [33]. Over time,   students greater motivation helps them exert more effort and   persevere when facing difficulties [34].   Classmates, especially higher-achieving ones with higher status,   can help create and maintain norms of positive attitudes toward   reading, regular learning behaviors and high reading achievement   [35]. Classmates can articulate and model positive academic   attitudes, such as sharing their enjoyment of specific stories.   Furthermore, they can discuss their readings daily to promote peer   pressure toward regular reading of new books. Together,   classmates can cultivate a culture of positive reading attitudes and   behaviors in which to immerse a student, which typically yields   higher reading achievement [36]. Note that hypothesis H-4a   competes with H-3 above.   H-4a. When classmates have a higher mean past academic   achievement, a student has higher academic   achievement.    H-4b. When classmates have a higher mean attitude toward   reading, a student has higher academic achievement.    A student can benefit not only from family resources but also from   classmates family resources.  Families can use their financial,   human, cultural and social capital to give their children learning   opportunities. Specifically, families with more money (financial   capital) can buy more educational resources (books, calculator,   etc.) to create a richer learning environment [18]. Furthermore, high   SES students often spend more time with their parents (due to less   parent time on housework and multi-tasking parents), so they can   benefit more from their parents human, social and cultural capital.   Families with more education, knowledge or skills (human capital)   often create better learning environments for their children, foster   better attitudes toward reading and teach them more skills   compared to other families [18]. Likewise, high SES families often   have cultural possessions or experiences (cultural capital) that can   help their children learn societys cultural knowledge, skills and   values to adapt to their school culture [34]. High SES families also   often have large social networks of relatives, friends and   acquaintances with skills or resources (social capital) that can help   their children learn [35]. Using their greater financial, human,   social and cultural capital, higher SES students can better   understand others expectations, behave properly at school, have   closer relationships with teachers and classmates, and learn more in   school than lower SES students do.    Similarly, a student can benefit from a classmates family resources   directly or indirectly [35]. In the most direct case, a student visits a   classmates home and uses the latters educational resources. A   student may work with a classmate on the classmates computer   (classmate family financial capital), discuss a book with the   classmates mom (classmate family human capital), discuss a     painting in the living room (classmate family cultural capital) or   chat with a family friend over dinner (classmate family social   capital). Less directly, a student can learn from a classmate   learning experiences at home [35], for example, when the classmate   talks about it (my mom was telling me about the presidential   election).    H-4c. When classmates have a higher mean family SES, a   student has higher academic achievement.    Tracking provides higher-achieving students with higher-achieving   classmates who often have more intellectual resources. However,   tracking provides low-achieving students with low-achieving   classmates who often have more intellectual resources. Hence,   tracking might benefit high achieving students more from low-  achieving students.   2.3 The Present Study   This study examines the effects of tracking on students reading   achievement through analyses of 208,057 fourth grade primary   school students in 40 countries. We focus on three research   questions. First, does tracking at school- or class-levels linked to   better reading achievement Second, do these links operate through   the mechanisms of customized instruction, homophily, giving help,   receiving help, diversity, competition/social comparison, sharing   resources or superior benefits for high-achieving students Lastly,   do these relations differ across subsamples of the lowest-achieving   10%, 20% and 50% of students and the highest-achieving 50%,   20% and 10% of students   As past studies have shown that reading achievement is related to   the following variables, we included them in our regression model   to reduce omitted variable bias [8]: country economic growth   (gross domestic product per capita) [18], family income inequality   in a country (Gini index) [18], family SES [35], home educational   resources [18], student gender [36], reading self-concept [38],   attitude toward reading [35], parent attitude toward reading [35],   school climate [39], and teacher gender [40].   3. METHODS   3.1 Data   In 40 countries, the International Association for the Evaluation of   Education Achievement Progress in International Reading Literacy   Study (IEA-PIRLS) assessed 208,057 fourth-grade students, and   their parents, teachers and school principals completed   questionnaires [41]. IEA chose at least 150 representative schools   in each country, based on neighborhood SES and student intake.   From each school, IEA selected one or two 4th grade classes,   yielding a sample size of at least 4,000 students per country   (stratified sampling) [41]. Participating students completed an 80-  minute assessment booklet and then a 1530-minute questionnaire.   The World Bank collected economic data for each country (annual   income and income inequality) [42].    3.2 Variables  Table 1.

First, we enter past student achievement (Past_Literacy_Skills).   Readingijk = 000 +eijk + f0jk + g00k + rjkPast_Literacy_Skillsijk         + 00sCountry00k + tjkFamilyijk + ujkClassmates_Familiesijk   + vjkSchool&Teacherijk + wjkStudentijk + xjkClassmatesijk     + zjkClassmates_Varianceijk          (1)    Then, we entered a vector of s variables at the country level: GDP   per capita, Gini index, school clustering of students by past reading   achievement before school (Country, see table 1) to test whether   more school clustering is linked to higher reading achievement   (hypothesis H-1). To test for non-linear effects, squared terms (e.g.,   Gini2) were added. We tested whether sets of predictors were   significant with a nested hypothesis test (2 log likelihood) [8].   Non-significant variables were removed. Next, we added family   variables: family SES, parents' attitude towards reading and home     education resources (Family). Then, we added class means of   family SES, home education resources, and parents attitudes   toward reading (Classmates_Families) to test whether higher   reading achievement is linked to higher classmate SES (H-4c).   Next, we added school and teacher variables: school violence,   female teacher, and homework mismatch (School&Teacher),   followed by student variables: gender, students attitude towards   reading, students reading self-concept (Student). Then, we added   the class mean of past reading achievement and class mean of   attitude towards reading (Classmates). This tests the competing   hypotheses of whether higher classmates past achievement is   linked to a students lower reading achievement (H-3) or higher   reading achievement (H-4a). It also tests whether classmates with   superior reading attitudes are linked to a students higher reading   achievement (H-4b).   Lastly, we added the class variances of past student achievement,   SES, and students' attitude towards reading   (Classmates_Variance) to test whether higher academic   achievement is linked to higher variance in classmate past   achievement (H-2a), to higher variance in classmate reading   attitude (H-2b) or to higher variance in classmate SES (H-2c).     To determine whether high-achieving vs. low-achieving students   have greater access to or benefits from available resources, we   tested if the above links differed across student sub-samples. We   created six sub-samples of students by reading achievement   (bottom 10%, bottom 20%, bottom 50%, top 50%, top 20%, and   top 10% from each country).    4. RESULTS  4.1 Summary Statistics  This samples countries ranged from poor, very unequal nations   (e.g., Iran) to rich, relatively equal ones (e.g., Luxembourg). See   Table 1 for overall summary statistics.   4.2 Explanatory Model  Past reading achievement, country, family, school, teacher, student,   classmates and class variance variables accounted for differences   in students reading achievement (see Table 2). The differences in   reading achievement at the country-, school-, and student-levels   were 58%, 13%, and 29%. All results discussed below describe first   entry into the regression, controlling for all previously included   variables.    4.2.1 Past Reading Achievement   Students whose past reading achievement exceeded the mean by   10% averaged 5 more points in reading achievement (Table 2,   model 1). Past reading achievement accounted for 2% of the   differences in students reading achievement.   4.2.2 Country  Meanwhile, students in richer or more equal countries scored   higher (see Table 2). If a richer country's GDP per capita exceeded   the country mean by 10%, its students averaged 4 more points in   reading achievement. (Regressions with linear GDP per capita did   not fit the data as well, explaining less of the variance in students'   reading achievement.) Meanwhile, when a country's GINI   exceeded the mean by 10%, its students averaged 20 points lower   in reading.    If a countrys clustering of students by past reading achievement   exceeded the mean by 10%, students averaged 45 more points in   reading achievement, supporting hypothesis H-1 (instruction   customization). Furthermore, school clustering showed a non-  linear effect (see Figure 1). The effect size increases up to a    Table 2.

Extreme school clustering beyond two   standard deviations (> 0.30) tends to reduce student reading   achievement.

If parents have 10% better reading attitude, their         Figure 1. School Clustering by Past Achievement. All   figures graphs have the same reading achievement y-axis   scale of -100 to 200. Each blue dot indicates an explanatory   variables mean value, and the solid blue curve indicates   values within two standard deviations of this mean. The   dashed curves indicate extreme values outside two standard   deviations of this mean. Some curves have a turning point   (minimum or maximum), indicated by a red X.    children averaged 2 points higher in reading. Meanwhile, students   with 10% more home education resources averaged 4 points   higher in reading. Family variables accounted for an extra 7% of   the variance in students reading achievement.   4.2.4 Classmates Families  Classmate family variables were also linked to students' reading   achievement (see Table 2). If classmate family SES exceeded the   mean by 10%, students averaged 4 points higher in reading   achievement, supporting the classmate sharing hypothesis H-4c,   and this non-linear effect decreases for higher classmate family   SES (diminishing marginal returns; see Figure 2) [18].       Figure 2. Class Mean SES   Students with classmates who had 10% more education resources   at home averaged 5 points higher reading achievement. (This   technically non-linear effect was nearly linear, see Figure 3.)      Figure 3. Class Mean Home Education Resources   4.2.5 School and teacher  School and teacher variables were linked to students' reading   achievement (see Table 2). Students in schools with 10% less   school violence averaged 2 points higher in reading, and students   with a female teacher averaged 5 points higher than those with a   male teacher. Also, if teachers' misjudgment of students' homework   time exceeded the mean by 10%, their students averaged 1 point   lower in reading. School and teacher variables accounted for an   extra 1% of the variance in students reading achievement.   4.2.6 Student  Girls outscored boys by 13 points on average (Table 2, model 6).   Moreover, students with 10% better reading attitude or 10% higher   reading self-concept averaged 3 or 6 points higher in reading,   respectively (see Table 2). Student variables accounted for an extra   4% of the variance in students' reading achievement.   4.2.7 Classmates  When classmates past reading achievement exceeded the mean by   10%, students averaged 2 points higher reading achievement,   supporting hypothesis H-4a (classmates share) and rejecting   hypothesis H-3 (classmates compete). See Table 2. This nonlinear   effect has a minimum when classmate past achievement is -0.30   (~10th  percentile at -0.63 SD (below the mean); -0.63 = [-0.30  0]   / 0.48); at lower values beyond this turning point, student reading   achievement scores tend to be higher (see Figure 4). Together,   classmates' family variables accounted for an extra 6% of the   variance in students' reading achievement.      Figure 4. Class Mean Past Reading Achievement   When classmates reading attitudes exceeded the mean by 10%,   students averaged 1 point higher in reading (see Table 2),   supporting hypothesis H-4b; the link is slightly stronger for higher   classmate reading attitudes (see Figure 5).  This classmate variable   accounted for an extra 0.1% of the variance in students' reading   achievement.      Figure 5. Class Mean Reading Attitude   4.2.8 Classmate variance  Classmate variances were also linked to student reading   achievement (see Table 2). When variance of classmates past   acheivement exceeded the mean by 10%, students averaged 1 point   higher in reading achievement, supporting hypothesis H-2a (giving   and receiving help). The strength of this link increases up to a   maximum at a variance of 1.19 (~86th percentile for a normal curve   or 1.11 standard deviations above the mean; 1.11 = [1.19  0.80]   / .35 = ([X  mean] / SD).

Past Achievement  Class Variance   variances tend to reduce students reading achievement. Also,   students in classes with 10% more variance in classmates' reading   attitudes averaged 2 points higher in reading, supporting hypothesis   H-2b (attitude diversity). The strength of this link increases up to a   maximum at a variance of 1.40 (~87th percentile for a normal curve   or 1.51 standard deviations above the mean; 1.51 = [1.40  0.87]   / .35 = ([X  mean] / SD)). See Figure 7. Lastly, students in classes   with 10% more SES variance averaged 0.2 points higher in reading   achievement, supporting H-2c (SES diversity). Class variances   accounted for an extra 1% of the variance in students' reading   achievement. Other variables were not significant.      Figure 6. Reading Attitude  Class Variance   4.3 Achievement Sub-samples  Many variables showed similar, significant results in all   achievement sub-samples (see Table 3): past reading achievement,   log GDP per capita, GINI, clustering of students by past reading   achievement, parents' attitude towards reading, home education   resources, classmates mean SES, classmates home education   resources, school violence, students' gender, students' reading self-  concept, and class variance in students' attitude towards reading.    (The consistency of non-linear results can be seen by graphing the   quadratic functions. Due to space considerations, these graphs are   not included but are available upon request.)   However, the achievement subsample results varied for the   following attributes: teacher gender, homework mismatch, and   many classmate-related variables (SES variance; mean and   variance of their parents reading attitudes; mean and variance of   past achievement; and reading attitude). Teacher gender and   homework mismatch were not significant for the top 10% of   students in each country, suggesting that these factors do not affect   the highest-achieving students (perhaps because higher ability   students have successful, resilient ways of learning even in less   hospitable environments). Furthermore, variance in classmates   SES was significant for only the top 50% and top 20% of students   by achievement, suggesting that these students primarily benefit   from other students diverse resources and experiences; the results   are not significant for the other subsamples.   Also, the classmate reading attitudes results for the lowest-  achieving 10%, 20% and 50% of students were similar to the   overall result. However, the results were only significant for the   lowest-achieving 10%, 20% and 50% of students. This result   suggests that only the lower achieving students benefit from more   classmates with better attitudes toward reading.     For many subsamples of students, the links between mean and   variance of classmate past achievement and student reading   achievement were similar to the overall result. However, lower   mean classmate past achievement was linked to higher student   reading achievement for the lowest-achieving 10% and highest-  achieving 20% and 10% of students, which is consistent with the   classmate help hypothesis. Meanwhile, classmates past   achievement variance is positively related to reading achievement   for the lowest-achieving 10%, 20% and 50% of students but   negatively related to reading achievement for the highest-achieving   20% and 10% of students and not significant for the highest-  achieving 50% of students. We discuss these results below.   None of the above results show substantial homophily or labeling   effects. Analyses using standardized scores within each country   yielded similar results. Analyses of residuals showed no influential   outliers.   5. DISCUSSION  We examined the effects of tracking on students reading   achievement through analyses of 208,057 fourth grade primary   school students in 40 countries. There are five major findings. First,   tracking across schools (streaming) was linked to higher reading   achievement. Specifically, school clustering of students by past   reading achievement yielded higher reading achievement,   supporting the instruction customization hypothesis. Second, a   student generally benefited from classmates resources (SES, home   educational resources, reading attitude, past achievement),   suggesting that classmates shared their resources and this sharing   of resources yielded higher academic achievement. Third, tracking   at the class level was linked to lower reading achievement. Greater   variance of classmate family SES, reading attitude or past   achievement were all linked to higher reading achievement,   supporting the helping and diversity hypotheses. Fourth, several   relations were non-linear with turning points (minimums or   maximums): school clustering by past reading achievement, mean   and variance of classmate past achievement, and variance of   classmate reading attitude. Fifth, some relations differed across   achievement subsamples, notably classmate reading attitude,   classmate past achievement, variance of classmate SES, and   variance of classmate past achievement.   5.1 School Clustering  The school clustering by past reading achievement results likely   reflect instruction customization rather than homophily. As   homophily was not evident in the classroom-level results, it likely   does not account for the broader, school clustering result. Instead,   the school clustering and classmate results are consistent with the   view that instruction customization is likely more efficient and   effective at the school level (streaming) than at the class level. They   suggest that greater school clustering of students by past reading   achievement up to about two standard deviations above the mean   might help educators target curricula and instruction to specific   schools of students with similar academic competence to help them   learn more. The lower reading achievement of students in education   systems with extremely high clustering (more than two standard   deviations above the mean) suggest that classmates with extremely   similar past reading achievement can be harmful; instead, moderate   classmate variation is useful, consistent with the classmate-level   results.   -100  -50  0  50  100  150  200  0 1 2 3 4  -100  -50  0  50  100  150  200  0 1 2 3    Table 3.

Each regression included a constant term.  *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.   5.2 Classmate Resources  The classmate mean results show that a student generally benefited   from classmates sharing of resources (social capital [35]).  A   student whose classmates had higher family SES, home educational   resources, reading attitudes, or past achievements often had higher   reading achievement than other students. Classmate family SES   and home educational resources both had positive relations with   student reading achievement, consistent with the view that   classmates shared educational materials, ideas and experiences     with a student to aid their reading achievement [35]. Classmate   family SESs diminishing marginal returns show that it benefits   lower SES students more than higher SES students; hence, mixing   high SES students with low SES students maximizes the classmate   SESs benefits [14]. If SES is highly correlated with student past   achievement in a country however, we cannot both track students   into schools by achievement and ensure that all students have some   classmates with high SES.   Meanwhile, classmates with better reading attitudes primarily   benefited low-achieving students, showing no significant effect on   high-achieving students. This result suggests that classmate reading   attitude has a ceiling effect, helpful for low-achieving students who   might have poorer reading attitudes but not for high-achieving   students who may already have sufficiently positive attitudes   toward reading (reading attitude has a weak positive correlation   with reading achievement in these data, r = .12). Hence, assigning   some students with positive reading attitudes into the same classes   as low-achieving students might improve the latters reading   achievement without harming the former.   5.3 Tracking across Classes  Very high or very low classmate past achievement was linked to   higher student reading scores, supporting the hypothesis that   students learn more by receiving help from higher-achieving   classmates or by giving help to lower-achieving classmates [19].   The achievement subsamples further showed that lower mean   classmate past achievement was linked to higher student reading   achievement for the highest-achieving 10% and 20% of students   and for the lowest-achieving 10% of students.  As a high-achieving   student is less likely than other students to ask for help from their   classmates, she can learn more with more low-achieving   classmates, to whom she can give help (more help opportunities).   On the other hand, a very low-achieving student benefits from   classmates with lower reading achievement, perhaps because they   are more likely to understand his or her learning difficulties and   help appropriately (Vygotskys zone of proximal development   [43]). Or, a low-achieving student might have more help   opportunities with still lower-achieving classmates. Together, these   results suggest that a variety of low- and high-achieving students in   a classroom creates more helping opportunities that can aid the   learning of both givers and receivers of help.   The results involving classmate variances (reading attitude, family   SES, or past achievement) do not support tracking across classes   (within school). Greater variance in classmate reading attitude was   linked to greater reading achievement, consistent with the view that   students learn from observing the consequences of classmates with   different reading attitudes and appreciating the importance of   desirable ones. Variance in classmate reading attitude also showed   diminishing marginal returns, indicating that some variation in   classmate reading attitude is sufficient to realize much of the   benefits and that maximizing variation is not necessary.   While higher classmate family SES generally benefits all students,   greater variance in classmate family SES is linked to greater   reading achievement only for the highest-achieving 50% and 20%   of students, with no significant effects on other students.  Hence,   mixing students with different family SES together might benefit   these high-achieving students without harming other students.   Lastly, the link between variance in classmate past achievement   and reading achievement differs across achievement subsamples.   For the lowest-achieving 10%, 20% and 50% of students, greater   variance in classmate past achievement is linked to higher reading   achievement. This result supports the view that a greater variety of   classmates across achievement levels offers more opportunities for   a low-achieving student to give and receive help to learn more.   Meanwhile, the highest-achieving 20% and 10% of students have   higher reading scores when their classmates have similar, low past   achievement levels. Perhaps, a high achieving student can elaborate   his or her knowledge with a helpful explanation to a lower   achieving student, but has difficulty creating several explanations   for students at different, lower-ability levels which might be   frustrating, time-consuming or harmful to his or her learning.    Meanwhile, variance in classmate past achievement is not   significantly related to reading achievement for the highest-  achieving 50% of students, possibly because they generally face   sufficient variation in classmate ability to both give and receive   help.  Together, these results suggest placing high-achieving   students with a limited range of low-achieving classmates.   This study not only provides general advice for assigning fourth   grade students to classrooms but also showcases a methodology for   principals to use on their own school data to customize assignment   of their own students. While this analysis uses data from many   countries and schools, a principal can analyze his or her own school   data across time for assigning his or her students.   6. CONCLUSION  This study investigated the links between grouping students by   ability and their reading achievement, suggesting possible   mechanisms and showing how it might influence the learning of   students at different levels of reading ability. Greater clustering of   students by past reading achievement in schools is linked to greater   reading achievement, suggesting that streaming across schools can   be effective. However, tracking at the class level was not linked to   greater reading achievement. Instead, greater variances in   classmates family SES, in classmates attitudes toward reading   and in classmates past reading achievement were linked to greater   reading achievement. Moreover, when classmates had greater   family SES, home education resources, attitudes toward reading or   past reading achievement, a student had higher reading   achievement. This result suggests that classmates shared   educational resources, attitudes, ideas and experiences to help a   student learn. The nonlinear links between several factors   (especially school clustering and classmate past achievement) and   reading achievement, and the results of the achievement subsample   analyses further support these interpretations. These results suggest   low-cost education policies, namely re-allocation of students and   resources, for improving students reading achievement.   7.
