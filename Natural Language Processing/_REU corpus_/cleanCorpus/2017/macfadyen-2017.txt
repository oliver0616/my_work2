This interactive half- day workshop responds to the LA literature describing the benefits  and challenges of institutional LA implementation by offering  participants an opportunity to learn about and begin planning for a  program to actively engage faculty as leaders of data exploration  around the theme of student success. This session will share  experiences from five institutions actively engaged in fostering  Learning Analytics Communities (LAC) by identifying key issues,  sharing lessons learned, and considering structural frameworks that  are transferable to other institutional contexts. Structured  discussion and activities will engage participants in developing an  action plan for establishing an LAC on their own campus.

WORKSHOP BACKGROUND  Institutional implementation of learning analytics calls for  thoughtful management of cultural change. In addition to technical  and infrastructure planning, researchers and institutions engaged in   LA planning have identified that effective implementation of  institutional learning analytics requires strategic efforts to engage  the community in conversations about the potential for learning  analytics to improve student success, and to generate excitement  and engagement by key stakeholders (students, faculty, instructors,  senior administrators) [1,2]. As change management specialists  [3,4,5] have pointed out, change in habits, practices and behaviours  is not brought about by simply giving people large volumes of  logical data [6]. Overcoming resistance to innovation and change  calls for planning processes which create conditions that allow  participants to both think and feel positively about change   conditions that appeal to both the heart and the head.    Research suggests that communities of practice have positive  effects on teaching development, and that faculty engagement in  such communities leads to positive changes in teaching behaviors.  [7,8,9]. Moreover, faculty who engage in systematic inquiry on  student learning in their own classrooms and programs  (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning or SoTL) report a wide  range of benefits, including documented improvements in the  quality of their students learning, more of their students achieving  higher standards, and an increased interest in positively influencing  teaching in their department beyond their own practice [10,11]   In order to increase the use of big data for informed decision- making in higher education, we must expand its use to the  departmental and course levels, which calls for faculty ownership  of research questions that examine and define student success.  LACs offer the potential to bring faculty of all ranks into the  learning analytics conversation early, and allow them to lead data  exploration projects and share their findings with colleagues and  peers. Such programs can be conceptualized as fostering  institutional Communities of Transformation [12] that can  address both individual faculty and broader systemic change, and  create innovative spaces that have the potential to shift institutional  and disciplinary norms. This workshop will describe and share our  experience with establishment of institutional LACs that can foster  enthusiasm about the affordances of learning analytics and their  potential to support student success and improved teaching and  learning.

This workshop will be led by and  will draw on the experiences of LAC leaders in these institutions.   2. WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES  This half-day workshop will help participants create a plan for  building a campus community devoted to using learning analytics  to improve teaching and learning. It will explore the challenges and  successes from similar programs at universities in the BVA, lead  participants through exercises in setting goals, creating meaningful  questions, and encourage involvement from faculty and  departments for data-driven decision making at the course, program  and curricular levels.    The workshop will start with a brief self-assessment on the needs  of individual campuses, and the challenges participants are likely  to encounter in using learning analytics to improve teaching and  learning. Workshop leaders will then draw on their institutional  experiences to help participants address a series of topics and  questions:   Program goals: How can institutions create communities of  transformation around learning analytics How can we expand  faculty inquiry about student success from the course level to the  curricular level How are we facilitating the use of LA by faculty,  departments, and campus leaders   Establishment of community: How might LACs differ from other  types of Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) How can we best  facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations throughout the inquiry  process   Types of research questions explored: What types of questions  work best in tying learning analytics to teaching and learning  Which have driven research in existing LACs How have these  questions been answered and how have they informed our  understanding of student success    Data collection and management: What types of data are most  valuable in addressing questions about student success How have  these data been collected and managed to increase efficiency of  delivery to faculty investigators What other data might be valuable  (e.g., student surveys)   Supporting faculty LA research: Which methods best support  faculty-led LA research (especially those not familiar with data- rich social science research methods)    Throughout this workshop, participants will be encouraged to use  an action-plan worksheet that assists with analysis of their own  institutional contexts. In the engagement phase, participants will  brainstorm and work with fellow participants to identify local goals  and stakeholders. By the end of the workshop participants will have  created an action plan for development of an LAC on their own  campuses.    Overall, participants will: Evaluate learning analytics readiness on  their campus; Learn how other institutions have used data-driven  decision making to improve student success; Identify key issues  relevant to establishing faculty ownership of learning analytics                                                                        1http://citl.indiana.edu/programs/grants/learninganalytics-CFP.php    projects, personalizing them for their institutional contexts; Identify  potential stakeholders involved in learning analytics efforts at their  institutions; and develop an action plan for creating a learning  analytics community on their campus.   3.
