However, in large-scale online contexts, such as MOOCs, the  number of learners and highly asynchronous nature militates  against the development of a sense of belonging and dyadic trust.  Given these challenges, instead of conventional instruments that  reflect learners affective perceptions, we suggest a set of  indicators that can be used to evaluate social activity in relation to  the participation structure. These group-level indicators can then  help teachers to gain insights into the evolution of social activity  shaped by their facilitation choices. For this study, group-level  indicators were derived from measuring information exchange  activity between the returning MOOC posters. By conceptualizing  this group as an identity-based community, we can apply  exponential random graph modelling to explain the networks  structure through the configurations of direct reciprocity, triadic- level exchange, and the effect of participants demonstrating  super-posting behavior. The findings provide novel insights into  network amplification, and highlight the differences between the  courses with different facilitation strategies. Direct reciprocation  was characteristic of non-facilitated groups. Exchange at the level  of triads was more prominent in highly facilitated online  communities with instructors involvement. Super-posting activity  was less pronounced in networks with higher triadic exchange,  and more pronounced in networks with higher direct reciprocity.

INTRODUCTION  With the massification and commercialization of higher  education, universities place more demands on educators to  deliver quality teaching to more students at lower costs. As a  result, educators need to adapt and modify their pedagogical    approaches to better accommodate a significantly larger and more  diverse group of students. Well-designed assessment to some  extent can help teachers determine if their efforts to help students  learn were effective. However, student performance data alone,  does not provide sufficient information about other aspects of the  learning and teaching context. An alternate approach is required  to explore if a teachers implemented facilitation processes were  successful in promoting interpersonal relationships and peer-to- peer learning.  Various instruments have been designed to capture the evolution  of in-class social relations related to the positive impact on  learning. Examples include the community of inquiry  questionnaire [45], surveys of social presence [34] and sense of  belonging [46]. These instruments evaluate the state of trust and  community often at the group-level as the ultimate outcome of  interpersonal relationship formation.  The importance of trust-based relationships has been associated  with small online and face-to-face classes where the group  boundaries are fixed. However, there remains a significant  challenge in leveraging the benefits of such interpersonal  relationships in large learner cohorts particularly in the non- formal contexts. In massive open online courses (MOOCs) learner  participation in social activities is intermittent [55], and early  interactions can amass to a level of chaos [3] that impedes an  individuals propensity for developing relationships. For instance,  according to Gillani, MOOC forums assemble and disperse as  crowds [10]. Additionally, as stated by Poquet et al. [39] the  relatively short time frames associated with MOOC offerings  further diminish the opportunities for learners to develop  interpersonal trust. Simply put, large course size, short duration of  teaching and the non-formal nature of MOOCs militate against  the development of community. In such instances the use of  established instruments evaluating if learner-learner bonds have  been forged becomes irrelevant.  The amplification of communication between participants could  serve as an effective and proactive indicator for group processes.  The promotion of connections between learners, concepts and  artefacts is favoured by networked learning, connectivism and  socio-material approaches [1, 28, 48]. For example, a connectivist  approach to teaching in networked systems includes controlling  the network of learners through a facilitating role  by amplifying,  curating, way-finding and socially-driven sense-making,  aggregating, filtering, modelling and being persistently present  [49]. In this context, the role of the teacher becomes strongly  aligned with promotion and facilitation of networks  interconnectedness. Thus, an amplified network of learner  communications may indicate if a structure and a climate  conducive to egalitarian participation has evolved.  This present study uses network indicators to explore social  activity in an open online course.

Exponential random graph  modelling (ERGMs) was applied to understand the extent of  direct and triadic-level reciprocity and the effects of participants  posting activity within each network. ERGMs required a  theoretically-driven hypothesis to be interpreted meaningfully.  Thus, based on our prior work we conceptualized groups of  regularly posting forum users, i.e. forum cores, as identity-based  online communities. Communication within the communities  were abstracted into network graphs for ERGM analysis. Results  highlighted the differences in propensity for tie formation and the  probability of information exchange across networks of different  size and course design. The examined MOOCs were conducted in  STEM disciplines, and delivered by the Delft University of  Technology via the edX platform in 2013-2015.   2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE  2.1 Analytics for Group-Level Social Activity  The social fabric of a learning group evolves from the structures  and processes created as the collective completes the assigned  work. The development of effective group strategies requires  teachers to adopt strong facilitation skills and techniques. In this  context, facilitation skills refer to the ability to design and manage  learning group structures and processes, and employ appropriate  and timely strategies to minimize the common problems that arise  when people work together [29]. Facilitation skills, learning  design and support of knowledge construction are all required to  establish an effective online teaching program [7]. However,  facilitation can be seen as distinct from the other two. Learning  design is geared towards teachers decisions about learning tasks,  course structure and assessment [6]. The support of knowledge  construction, or content facilitation [13], refers to a teachers  ability to promote students epistemic fluency. Facilitation is  content-neutral in that it promotes a structure and a culture of  participation built on individual dispositions to the group and one  another. Measuring learning outcomes that result from effective  facilitation is particularly challenging because they fall within the  socio-emotional domain.   Group-focused analyses can provide novel insights into how  social activity unfolds. For example, Huang et al [24] examined  the health of forums at the group level in 44 Coursera MOOCs in  relation to super-posting behaviours of its learners. The authors  found that overall higher activity from super-posters is positively  correlated with higher activity from other forum users, concluding  that the super-posters do not drown out the silent majority  (p.118). It should be noted, however, that such an evaluation of  the health of the forum was limited to the correlation of individual  counts of content-related messages between different types of  learners. The study is a reflective of how social activity on forums  is approached in MOOC research to date.  In current research of platform-based MOOCs, most indicators of  social activity are not well suited to evaluate the state of social  activity in a group. Analyses have been predominantly conducted  at the level of the individual, often as a complement to academic  performance (grades). Numerous studies have analysed the  association of a number of forum posts in relation to an  individuals performance [12]. For example, Kizilcec et al. [31]  demonstrated that completing learners who attempted a majority  of the assessments were also more active on the forum. Vu et al.  [52], however, found that the relationship between learning  performance and social interactions is not bi-directional. Although  high learning performance was positively correlated with active   social interactions, active social interactions were not necessarily  associated with performance. The importance of these analyses  lies in grasping the value of social activity for individual student  certification, however, they offer little insight into the group-level  forum dynamics.   Studies measuring individual engagement with others in the form  of social capital offer an alternative to evaluating the role of social  activity through post counts. Such an approach is based on  quantifying an individual learners position within the network of  posters [8, 25, 26]. However, such an approach does little to  reveal how the network emerges from the collective contributions.  To explain, although individual learning outcomes such as social  capital do provide information about social activity, they are not  sound indicators of group-level activities.   Where social activity in MOOCs has been evaluated at the group- level, the evaluations have tended to privilege the content- dimension of interaction. For instance, Hecking et al. [21]  encapsulated social interaction within content-related posts of the  network into blockmodels describing the overall network pattern.  Or, Kellogg et al. [30] reported knowledge construction within the  network of learners through qualitative analysis of learner posts.  Similarly, Wang et al. [53] identified and evaluated groups in the  course based on higher order thinking behaviours reflected  through posted text. These examples demonstrate that the  socioemotional dimension of learning is often taken for granted.  As argued by Kreijns et al. [33], when a need for the  socioemotional is recognized, the dimension is examined in the  context of a content-loaded learning task or as targeting cognitive  processes.   2.2 Social Network Analysis in MOOCs   Social network analysis (SNA) is widely used for evaluating  group-level social activity. SNA as a methodology combines  learner agency with the context where it operates. Thus, it offers  group-level insights into social activity in MOOCs. Early on  Ferguson & Shum [9] suggested the use of SNA for investigating  interpersonal relations mediated by social platforms. They  proposed to examine social relations through the prism of strong  and weak ties  theoretically loaded terms borrowed from social  science theory. This proposition aligns with the suggested focus  on inquiries into learning ties by Haythornthwaite & de Laat [20].  However, any inferences about group-level activity in MOOCs  drawn from current SNA research in learning analytics needs to  be enacted with caution.   On the one hand, SNA requires its methodological decisions to be  theoretically driven. Network research is relational, that is, its  main unit of analysis is a theoretically defined relation between  two actors. The meaning assigned to this unit of analysis directly  impacts the interpretations of the results. In short, a network is a  representation of a phenomenon, and consequently, this  phenomenon needs to be conceptually represented in the data [2].  In practical terms this is done by providing justification for  inclusion and exclusion of ties and edges, as well as drawing  network boundaries. According to Laumann, Marsden and  Prensky [35], errors in defining these boundaries reach beyond the  consequences of slightly biased estimates of population means,  proportions, or inefficiency in statistical estimation. Flawed  boundary specification may lead to the fundamental  misrepresentation of the process under study, since errors of  omitting one actor may distort the overall configuration of actors  in the system and render the entire analysis meaningless (p.19).     On the other hand, there is a lack of theorising social processes in  open online courses. As a result, there is a divergence in the  research resulting from the differing conceptualizations of  network ties. This largely stems from how post-reply structures  are interpreted. For instance, researchers examining Twitter  networks in MOOCs analyzed communication represented  through person-to-person information flow [15, 50]. Twitter  communication interactions are possibly the least ambiguous to  interpret as they are by design identical with the name networks  where there is little doubt as to who spoke to whom [16]. Post- reply communication structures appear to be replicated in studies  of platform-based MOOCs delivered via edX and Coursera.  However, the approaches adopted to analyse the forum data  differ. For instance, Joksimovic, et al., [27] used a conventional  directed post-reply structure commonly used in online education  forums: if author A2 replied to a message posted by author A1,  we would add a directed edge A2->A1. Further, if A3 posted a  comment on A2s post, we would include A3->A2 edge as well.  In contrast, Brown and colleagues [4], [5] used a post-reply  network structure based on communication going from one person  to many prior posters. Gillani, et al., [11] adopted another  alternate approach in a Coursera MOOC. In this instance, the  authors represented communication through an edge connecting  two learners simply if they co-posted in at least one discussion  thread. The diversity in how researchers are conceptualising  information/ communication flow as network structures impedes  our capacity to make broader inferences about group-level  learning activity. Hence, to draw meaningful interpretations from  graph analytical techniques employed in SNA of MOOCs, it is  imperative to theorise and conceptualise the phenomenon that is  being studied.     3. THE CURRENT STUDY  3.1. Our Approach  The aim of the current study is to develop indicators to evaluate  social activity in MOOCs, particularly in relation to forum  facilitation. Given that interpersonal relationships at scale may be  unattainable, we propose to examine the amplification of  communication within the networks of MOOC learners.   In our earlier research we argued that teaching online approaches  are derived from formal educational contexts, and there is a strong  need for new analytical frameworks that are distinct for MOOC  settings [39]. While open and formal online learning appear  similar, processes in formal online modes are streamlined by the  strict starting dates and learners motivation to complete. The  formal boundaries and learner motivations lie in stark contrast to  the more informal and open MOOC contexts. Yet, both research  and practice use theoretical and methodological frameworks  inherited from formal settings to analyse open online courses. To  overcome the challenge of compatibility of the tools with the  object of analysis, social processes emerging on MOOC forums  first need to be examined for forum sub-groups comparable in  dynamics to formal education settings. In contrast to many  MOOC learners who drop into the forums and leave, persistent  forum contributors experience a greater sense of continuity and  established history in their relationships typical for social groups  [40]. Thus, a sub-set of forum participants, termed as the forum  core, was established.  The forum core are posters who contributed to the forum in at  least any three weeks of the course and received replies to their  posts within the same course week. The underlying characteristic  of this sub-group is repeated presence and timeliness of the   reciprocated communication exchanges. The number of posts  does not distinguish this group from other posters. Some forum  core members could have as few as four to five posts, and some  non-forum core posters could have over a hundred.  To meaningfully capture indicators of participation patterns we  conceptualized forum core, i.e. a group of returning MOOC  posters, as identity-based community. Then, building on prior  research examining the properties of network formation in social  exchange networks, we inquired about the effects different  facilitation strategies may have on network configurations. The  underlying theoretical assumptions were evaluated by statistical  network analyses applied to ten cases of MOOCs. The following  section offers an overview of the prior work and relevant  theoretical and empirical literature that shaped the research  question.    3.2 Identity-Based Communities  Education research has tended to define community development  within two broad categories  community formed through a  common-identity or formed via a common-bond. The differences  between these categories lie within the origin of the group- attachment. One-to-one attachment among members is a  consequence of people liking each other. When approaching  attachment from a bond-based perspective, the focus is therefore  on interpersonal, dyadic relationships of trust. In contrast,  common-identity attachment is a result of self-identification with  groups purpose as in topic-based groups, such as sports team or a  school newspaper. These differences between common-identity  and common-bond communities are best captured by what  happens when a member leaves. When attachment is motivated by  identity, other members are perceived as interchangeable, and  turnover of membership does not impact individual behaviour as  much as in common-bond communities where members will leave  following their friends.  A common-identity approach has previously been applied to  informal online groups [41, 47, 51]. Postmes, Spears & Lea [44]  argued that the power of anonymity in groups where individuals  do not have cognitive representations of other individuals could  enhance the salience of a groups identity. The authors suggested  that paradigms in which group members do not meet face-to-face  provide precisely those conditions predicted to maximize social  influence exerted by social norms and social identities (p. 7).  Furthermore, in a series of experiments, Ren et al. [42]  demonstrated that facilitation of identity-based attachment had  stronger effects on the frequency of engagement than conditions  targeting interpersonal attachment development. Therefore,  defining a community through identity-based attachment of one- to-many is of high relevance in educational settings such as  MOOCs where the scale and non-privacy of the environment  aggravate the development of bond-based relationships.  In light of identity-based community theory, this present study  approached forum core as a social entity where attachment is  dictated by self-identification with a group without necessarily  investing in specific person-to-person relationships. Examination  of the discourse produced by forum core indicated traces of social  processes that forum core posters engaged in [40]. More  specifically, through qualitative analysis of forum content, Poquet  [38] identified the presence of discourse negotiating situational  norms, shared domain of practice, i.e. MOOC forum, and shared  experience, and, MOOC learning and assessment. Furthermore, in  a complementary study of the perceptions among those  contributing regularly Poquet et al. [39] found that forum core     participants reported the lack of dyadic trust and dyadic  familiarity in interpersonal perceptions but presence of higher  group cohesion perceptions. In short, forum cores in some courses  engaged in collective social processes, and developed perceptions  of group cohesion without underpinning interpersonal trust. This  empirical evidence allows to conceptualize the forum core as an  identity-based community based on information exchange.   3.4 Network Exchange Patterns in Online  Communities  Insights into the baseline properties of similar networks are  required to transition from theoretical analysis of forum core as  identity-based communities to applied analysis of the  amplification of its communication exchange. Studies of  electronic networks of practice offer information about network  topography in identity-based communities that help modelling  forum core participation structure.  Electronic networks of practice are conceptually aligned with the  major premises of identity-based communities. They are informal  groups that share knowledge about specific subject of interest  from photography groups on flickr to Wikipedia contributors to  software developers blogging community. According to Wasko et  al., [54], participants of public electronic networks reported trust  in the quality of information from active members (i.e. attachment  to the group), and that those actively participating were perceived  as trustworthy (i.e. belief in the group), thereby eliciting a  stronger motivation to continue participation (i.e. commitment to  participating in groups activity). Faraj & Johnson theorised such  online communities as social exchanges between participants  situated in a network context. That is, regardless of the content of  exchange, the interactions are more than just information queries,  but also have social nature and social purpose. In other words, in  their activities posters are conscious of the potential use by  readers, as well as current and future contributors through what  becomes a part of shared history. Simply put, electronic networks  of practice appear to represent a particular kind of an identity- based community.  The work of Faraj & Johnson served to empirically validate the  consistent and predictable network exchange patterns that emerge  from divergent motivations. They proposed three network patterns  that characterize the formation of the network of practice on the  micro-level: direct reciprocity (A replies to B because B helped A  in the past), indirect reciprocity (B helped to A, and thus A will  help C), and preferential attachment where new actors choose to  interact with already well-connected actors.  Through a large- scale longitudinal research of Yahoo! Bulletin boards, they found  a significant positive high propensity of direct reciprocation (A to  B to A), significant positive low propensity for indirect exchange  happening (A to B to C), and a negative propensity for  preferential attachment. The negative propensity for preferential  attachment has also been supported in studies of MOOC forum  networks [27, 30]. In summary, network configurations of  reciprocity lend themselves nicely to modelling baseline network  properties in forum core networks for further examination of the  differences between them in different facilitation contexts.   3.4. Focus of the Study  Building on the discussed theoretical and empirical literature,  MOOC forum cores are assumed to reflect natural patterns  occurring in identity-based communities characterized by network  exchange. Accordingly, forum cores that emerge and evolve in  courses with pedagogical interventions constituted by moderation   strategies would demonstrate different dynamics, varying along  with the intensity of facilitation. These differences in network  structure in courses with moderate and higher moderation would  then indicate the effects of intended forum strategies. In line with  this argument, the following research question was posed:  Are there differences in patterns of direct and triadic-level  reciprocity in forum core networks under different facilitation  strategies   To address this research question forum core communication  networks were analysed using models of social selection based on  the p*class models  [44].   4. METHODS  4.1. Network Construction  Forum core networks were constructed based on the premise that  they represented identity-based communities. That is, the analyses  were constructed from the forum core posters that were  committed to participating in forums activity, and driven by the  mix of altruistic and selfish reasons to engage in information  exchange. Their commitment was captured by the extended  participation criterion that distinguished forum core posters from  intermittent posters.   Network ties were non-valued and directed representing the  direction of the service offered. The ties were directed to all the  posters in the same thread who preceded the actor based on  timestamps. If A posted, B replied, and C commented, and D  replied, each of the subsequent actors would have a directed tie to  everybody else prior to them. That is, B -> A, C-> B, C->A, D- >C, D->B, D->A. Such tie inclusion was based on the principle of  collective reciprocity where an individual contributed information  to the group, rather than provided a service to an identified  individual.   The network boundaries were set around the course delivery time:  between the week the first video lecture was released, and the  week when the last lecture in the course was released. As  communication between actors can potentially continue well past  the course lectures due to exams or assignments, any established  closing date for the forum analysis would be arbitrary. The  discrete temporal limits applied in this study made the comparison  of courses more feasible.   4.2 Data Description  This present study analysed the forum interactions evolving from  ten (10) STEM courses delivered by the Delft University of  technology via edX platform in 2013-2015. Due to the evaluative  nature of the study, the courses were de-identified. Table 1 offers  an overview of the disciplines, sizes of posting cohort against the  forum core, course duration and qualitative description of the  forum facilitation strategies.   The dataset included five large MOOC with forum core higher  than one hundred people, and five smaller courses with forum  cores ranging from 2370 people. Three courses were highly  facilitated, i.e. instructor was among active posters, along with  designated staff members and TAs. Five courses had moderate  facilitation, i.e. although staff and TAs helped the information  flow, instructor was not involved with the forum. Finally, two  courses had low facilitation, i.e. nobody moderated the forums  except one or two staff announcement were posted.            Table 1.

ERGM is a methodology for the analysis of social  selection models. These models assume that characteristics of  actors influence them to select or be selected by others as social  partners [44]. These micro-level interactions resulting from social  selection aggregate into group-level patterns that describe the  network. Additionally, p*/ERGM presumes that multiple  processes can take place simultaneously, and social networks are  both structured and stochastic [36 p.10].    ERGM is a probability model for network analysis [17, 19, 36,  37]. In modelling ERGM estimates the likelihood of a parameter  for a theoretically justified network configuration (form) to occur  beyond chance. This is implemented by examining the likelihood  of a studied configuration (network form) to occur in a generated  distribution of random networks modelled on the network of  interest. Additionally, multi-level analysis within ERGM controls  for the tendency of studied parameters against one another, due to  their theoretical dependency. The output includes a parameter  estimate where zero indicates that the modelled effect is not  different from random. Estimated parameters are considered of  value after the goodness of fit is conducted upon the best fitting  model.    4.4 Modelled Configurations and Effects  This study investigated three configurations within forum core  networks: direct reciprocity characterized by mutuality statistic,  triadic-level exchange characterized by simmelianties statistic,  and the effect of learner super-posting activity on the propensity  of sending and receiving ties. Figure 1 depicts three network  configurations. The first two represent configurations of direct  and indirect reciprocity that, according to Faraj & Johnson are  baseline properties of network formation in identity-based  communities. We further hypothesised that forum core members  who overtime co-occur within direct (A to B to A, Figure 1a) and  indirect reciprocity (A to B to C, Figure 1b) will overtime form  triadic network configurations representing mutual and triadic  exchange that eventually could extend to a cycle if interaction  should continue. Joksimovic, et al., [27] previously fitted similar  network configuration (Figure 1c) using simmelianties statistic in  ERGM for MOOC forums. The authors interpreted it as  Simmelian ties [32]. From the analytical perspective, we take  inspiration and build on their approach. Yet, we interpret this   network configuration as amplification of parts of the network  due to generalized information exchange between the actors. Only  direct reciprocation and triadic-level exchange configurations  were therefore modelled.       a) Direct  Reciprocity b) Indirect Reciprocity c) Triadic-level exchange   Figure 1. Network Features Modelled in ERGMs. Adapted from  Faraj & Johnson (2010).   Markov network configuration were not used in the study to  model triadic exchange. Instead we use simmelainties statistic  available in R statnet package [18]. Morris, Hunter & Handcock  [37] explain that simmelian triads (Figure 1c) can overlap in terms  of nodes and ties, thus simmelianties is rather a measure of the  clustering of Simmelians (given the number of Simmelians).  Although social circuit parameters (gwesp) were fitted on some of  the networks, they were not characteristic of all networks, and  thus not used to maintain comparability in the modelled outputs.  Table 2 presents the counts of modelled network configurations  for each of the networks.  Table 2. Counts of network configuration in analyzed  networks.

To establish the overall level of activity, we applied in-reach and  out-reach measures of each individual activity as suggested by  Hecking, Hoppe & Harrer [22]. The authors developed measures  of entropy to calculate the diversity of outgoing and ingoing  relations for a node, and account for the weight of an edge, i.e.  frequency of dyadic ties between two given actors. We have  replicated their measure1, and applied it to the entire forum  network. We then applied k-means clustering to divide all forum  posters into three groups: with highest, moderate and low forum  posting activity in the entire network. These attributes of posting  activity were used to control for tie propensity formation in forum  core ERGMs. Table 3 presents the number of actors within each  cluster. Table 3 demonstrates the number of people with different  posting activity in each of the networks. Cluster 1 refers to the  learners with low posting activity. Cluster 2 refers to the posters  with moderate posting activity, and Cluster 3 represents  hyperposters. These interpretations do not fit to describe Course  C, where Cluster 3 and Cluster 4, in fact have similar activity                                                                        1https://github.com/hecking/socio_semantic_blockmodelling/blob  /master/scripts/centrality_over_time.R     levels, but Cluster 2 has higher in-reach measures, and Cluster 3  has higher out-reach measure.

That is, a hyperposter in  one course may have similar activity numerically as the moderate  poster in another course. Appendix 1 presents the measures for  cluster representatives.   5. RESULTS  This study examined the extent of communication exchange  amplification in the forum core networks of multiple MOOC  courses. Using an ERGM approach, we modelled the baseline  density of networks, direct reciprocity of ties, and triadic-level  exchange as the propensity of simmelianties network  configuration to cluster. We have also controlled for the level of  activity distinguishing between individuals with low, moderate  and high posting behaviour. The research question inquired if any  differences were observed between the measures of direct and  triadic-level exchange in networks where staff implemented  different facilitation strategies.  All fitted ERGMs have converged, were not degenerate, and  showed acceptable goodness of fit. All models were fitted using  the described network configurations. The two exceptions were  course G where models did not converge with the effects of  posting activity, and Course D where no super-posters were a part  of the forum core. Table 4, 5 and 6 outline the results grouped  together for courses with similar facilitation strategies.   First and foremost, our hypothesis that courses with no or low  facilitation reflect the network structures typical for online public  electronic groups was supported. In courses with low facilitation  (Table 4) we observed higher propensity for direct exchange, and  low or no propensity for exchange at the triadic-level. Course B,  as a large course, had posters with high level of activity, and they  were somewhat more likely to form ties than the posters with  moderate participation, though the difference was not stark.  Course G was very small, had no triadic-level exchange features,  and the null model was only slightly improved by adding the  direct reciprocity configuration.   In courses with moderate facilitation (Table 5), where teaching  assistants, staff or community assistants were advancing the  information flow, the dynamics had some similarities and  differences with unmoderated settings. For the similarities, theta  estimates for reciprocity in Courses D and F were higher than  those for triadic-level exchange mirroring the dynamics of  unmoderated courses. In three small courses (A, F and H) triadic- level exchange parameters were not significant, or even negative.   Interestingly, the propensity of super-posters to form ties as  compared to those posting moderately was more pronounced in  courses with lower or no triadic exchange, and heightened  reciprocity.

In an  unmoderated network information exchanges are random,  distributed and decentralised. In moderated networks, moderators  have much higher posting activity, sometimes dominating in  offering information to other learners. When this occurs, the  triadic-level exchange features seem to be either low, negative or  non-significant. By translating the log odds, we observe that the  high participation posters in course A were 22 times more likely to  form a tie as compared to low posters, while moderate posters  were three times more likely. At the same time, in an unmoderated  course B: posters with higher activity were six times as likely to  make a post than those with low posting behavior, and moderate  posters were three times more likely. We can speculate that in  cases where super-posters do not over-dominate, activity of those  with moderate posting behavior overtime grows, and these actors  engage in more conversations with one another as well as     interacting with super-posters, thereby resulting in an  amplification of communication exchange.  Finally, network structures in courses with high facilitation  differed from both moderated and unmoderated courses without  instructor participation (Table 6). Overall, it appears that in  courses with high facilitation, triadic exchange configuration has  a higher likelihood to occur than direct reciprocity. Such  dynamics are demonstrated in courses E and J, where clustering  of reciprocal triads are more characteristic of the network than  person-to-person reciprocations. In a course I, however, direct  reciprocity is still more characteristic of the network, which we  interpret as the lack of amplification within the information  exchange. Again, similar to the pattern observed with the  moderately facilitated courses, in course I, high posting  individuals are much more likely to form ties. In fact, by  converting log odds, we found that a super poster in course I was  eleven times more likely to form network ties than those with a  low level of forum activity. In courses E and J the likelihood for  super-posters to form ties was three times more than participants  with a low posting behavior. To note, the individual number of  posts by super-posters in course I was actually lower by count  than that of super-posters in the other two courses.    Table 6.

Direct reciprocity  of knowledge exchange seems to be inherent in identity-based  communities, such as forum core. Overtime and with facilitative  efforts network structure starts being defined by core and  periphery: with both random reciprocation and low clustering of  more generalized, triadic, exchange, likely at the core of the  group. This clustering may also be interpreted as clique  formation, or polarization of power and access that takes place as  the network shifts from distributed to amplified. Facilitated forum  core networks appear to be characterized by higher degree of  clustering of reciprocated triads, and lower level of random  reciprocation. This could mean that random direct exchanges  within the group decrease, as information flow gets to amplify  across more and more members, shifting from cliquish core and  distributed periphery to an amplified interconnected cluster. We  also observed that super-posting activity does seem to be  associated with lower level of exchange between triads. In other  words, a moderator may be taking over what somebody else could  address by offering her services too much or too fast, therefore  not allowing other members to indirectly reciprocate to the group.   To conclude, according to ERGM results, network features  modelled to gain insight into network amplification were useful in   highlighting differences between the courses with different  facilitation strategies. More specifically, direct reciprocation was  characteristic of non-facilitated groups, while triadic-level  exchange was more prominent in highly facilitated online  communities with instructors involvement. Finally, super posting  activity was less pronounced in networks with higher triadic-level  exchange, and more pronounced in networks with higher direct  reciprocity.   6. DISCUSSION  The aim of the current study was to establish potential indicators  for evaluating social activity in MOOCs, particularly in relation to  forum facilitation. Thus, in lieu of measuring affective individual  perceptions as indicators of socio-emotional processes, the extent  of amplification in communication exchanges between MOOC  learners was examined. A sub-group of MOOC forum posters was  conceptualized as an identity-based community. Building on the  prior research on the properties of network formation in social  exchange networks, we modelled ten forum core networks using  network configurations of direct reciprocity and triadic-level  exchange, while controlling for the overall level of individual  activity.  Results support our hypotheses about the nature of the forum core  in MOOCs, and suggest that the chosen indicators of forum core  networks may be useful in evaluating the effects of facilitation.  That is, courses with varying levels of moderation differ in the  likelihood of direct and triadic exchanges that take place. In non- facilitated courses, the dynamics of the networks was similar to  electronic networks of practice, and largely characterized by  direct reciprocity. In highly moderated networks, triadic-level  exchange configurations were more prominent than direct  reciprocity. That is, these networks were amplified by the  propensity of reciprocated ties in triads to cluster. Furthermore, a  higher degree of triadic-level exchange seemed to take place in  networks where activity of super-posting participants was less  pronounced as compared to those posting moderately or at low  levels.  The main contribution of the study is that its indicators of group- level social activities differentiated between the network  structures in forums with different facilitation strategies. Our  results demonstrated that moderating the forum per se is  insufficient for the effective evolution of participation. Courses  with teaching assistants and staff demonstrate different patterns  than those with instructor involvement. In courses with moderate  facilitation interventions reciprocal triads have lower likelihood to  occur than in highly facilitated forums with instructors  involvement. These findings re-iterate the importance of teachers  social presence and its impact on the level of engagement in open  online communities.  It is not surprising to learn that an instructors presence motivates  learners to participate - even in large scale courses. This finding  has been widely discussed and supported in formal online  education research. This study offers additional insights into the  roles, played by the staff, teaching and community assistants.  MOOC research claimed their importance in supporting the spirit  of the forums. Our findings further demonstrate that moderated  forums appear to transition from their baseline properties, as the  structure shifts from distributed to more hierarchical network.  The results of the present study also support Huang et al.s  conclusion that super-posters do not drown out the silent majority.  The observed interplay between the prominence of moderator  involvement and the development of exchange at the triadic-level     features suggest that the health of the forum may still be affected.  In courses where super-posting activity is more distinct than that  of moderate posters, features of triadic-level exchange are not  more pronounced than direct reciprocity features. Such dynamics  may indicate that super-posters are limiting engagement  opportunities for learners who are moderately active. In other  words, if there is a moderator who always replies, and no teacher  to stimulate the dialogue, then the community has less reason to  engage with one another. It seems that super-posters, who are  staff and teaching assistants at early stages, help the network to  develop, but they are not always skillful at decreasing their  activity at an optimal time.  This studys analysis yielded many promising results. However,  further work is still required. Much of the interpretation of this  work and the associated implications are at this point speculative.  Future work should seek to account for the temporal aspect of  how the network unfolds and interacts, as well as include forum  core interactions with the rest of the forum posters in MOOCs. An  extrapolation of the findings relates to the time based dynamics of  network formation. We suggest that facilitation shifts the forum  core network structure from a distributed to cliquish to egalitarian  structure. Here an egalitarian structure is the product of combined  direct and indirect reciprocity. Forum core is in its turn situated  within the network exchanges of intermittent posters, and the  relationship of forum core to those posters is based on the features  of indirect reciprocity. That is, if a forum core member gets  reciprocated by a staff member at an early stage, she would be  more likely to offer answer to an intermittent poster later on. In  other words, measuring the extent of network amplification over  time offers partial explanation of the nature of social exchanges,  while indirect reciprocation between the forum core and the other  poster explains the remaining dynamics. These speculations form  the basis of our future research.  Several direct implications stem from this studys analyses. First,  empirical validation of forum core networks as identity-based  communities is valuable as MOOC forum research can build on  the established research agenda both in social science and in  studies of human-computer interaction. For instance, Ren et al.  [43] developed a set of design principles for the facilitation of  identity-based communities, and these could be applied in  MOOCs. Yet, as the dataset of courses was limited, more diverse  sets of courses need to be analyzed to see if the insights  demonstrate consistent patterns across disciplines, student cohorts  and class sizes.  While this study did not include text mining and analysis of  learner posts, identity-based online communities have been  researched using text analysis along with SNA. Particularly  [14]  suggested that measures of entropy capture the lack of topical  diversity in identity-based communities, what they refer to as  topical groups, and the divergence of discussion themes in what  they refer to as social groups. Furthermore, granular text mining  for the concepts related to power and authoritativeness [e.g. 23]  may offer insights as to where the shifts in network structure are  reflected in the text features of the various learner posts. On a  final note, the indicators proposed from this work should be  validated in formal online education environments, to assess for  comparability between formal and open online settings.   7.
