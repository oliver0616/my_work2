By combining this technology   with biological sensors, a student in a virtual educational   environment can be monitored for physiological markers of   engagement or more cognitive states of learning. With this   information, the virtual reality environment can be adaptively   altered to reflect the students state, essentially creating a closed-  loop feedback system. This paper explores these concepts, and   presents preliminary data on a combined EEG-VR working   memory experiment as a first step toward a broader   implementation of an intelligent adaptive learning system.

INTRODUCTION  An important and foundational concept of learning analytics is the   necessity of feedback or intervention to improve education and   learning.  Since the early days of learning theory, such as Kolbs   Experiential Learning Theory [1] and Banduras Social Learning   Theory [2], feedback has been considered to be an integral   element of learning. A large amount of modern empirical research   has focused on the usefulness and appropriateness of different   methods of feedback. In general, feedback seems to be more   effective when it focuses the individuals attention on task-related   information as opposed to self-related information or praise [3],   and when it is immediate as opposed to delayed, particularly when   more real-world paradigms are used [4, 5, 6]. Additionally, the   most successful feedback provides information on how to   improve, not just the correct answer, while remaining relatively   simple and easy for the learner to understand [7].   Campbell and Oblingers five-step model of learning analytics [8]   highlights the importance of tailoring interventions for learners in   the Predict, Act, and Refine stages. By collecting data about   individual learners, teachers can create personalized models that   predict success in a particular course, lesson, or even question.  If   the model reports that a student is at risk for failure, the teacher   can intervene to provide additional guidance to the student.    Finally, the result of this intervention, and continued collection of   data, can be used to refine and update the model for continued   successful prediction. These ideas of effectively utilizing data to   improve learning interventions are similarly expressed in other   learning analytics models as well [9, 10].   Recently, Clow [11] expanded on the five-step model by   introducing the Learning Analytics Cycle. Here, learners engage   in some form of education material, leading to collection of data   (which could be demographic, assessment-based, etc.) about the   learner.  These data are processed into metrics, outcome variables   which provide insight into learning or predict success. The   important last step is to use these metrics to intervene and alter the   learning process, effectively creating a closed-loop system; the   data output by the learner determines the intervention, which   affects the input.   Under this framework, learning will be most improved when   interventions are provided in real-time to the learner  as soon as   some predictive metric is obtained that identifies the individual   will fail, the system should intervene.  Here, we propose a system   to accomplish this goal that can provide rapid, informative   intervention prior to the subject even responding.  By measuring   electroencephalography (EEG) signals, we can track the   individuals learning state in real-time. Additionally, by providing   instruction in a virtual reality (VR) environment, we can not only   provide a more realistic learning environment, but also more   easily and adaptively alter the learning environment to intervene   based on the EEG signal, effectively closing the loop.    2. VIRTUAL REALITY  VR refers to technology that simulates a realistic three-  dimensional environment for the user to interact with.

The   digital environment is sent from the computer to the screen in the   headset. This allows the user to look around the 3D environment,   and also acts to reduce sensory input from the outside world.   Although interest and development of VR technology has been   present since the 1980s [12], the technological advancements of   the last several years have put a spotlight on VRs potential   applications and propelled the industry to new heights [13].   Importantly, many of these advancements, such as improved   graphical rendering and room-scale positional tracking, allow for   greater presence in the environment.  Presence, defined as the   phenomenological sense of actually being in a virtual environment   [14, 15], is important for educational VR applications.    Essentially, students will be more focused and attentive to   learning material, and less distracted by task-unrelated stimuli, if   they are deeply immersed in the virtual environment. This   immersion could enhance education in even advanced areas of   study  for example, a student studying marine biology could   explore virtual ocean environments and interact with simulated   marine life.   While the literature is currently somewhat limited, there has been   some research on VR applications geared toward training   individuals and improving learning [16]. VR has been shown to   be useful for learning certain visual-spatial tasks [17], and this   knowledge transfers to real world spatial navigation [18, 19].    Some preliminary work has also shown modest benefits on test   scores after VR training in geometry [20] and geography [21].    Additional work has shown real world benefits in surgery   performance after sessions of virtual surgery training [22, 23].    Lastly, a large-scale meta-analysis of virtual reality studies in   educational settings found that VR was overall effective at   improving learning outcomes [24]. Thus, while the evidence is   still somewhat limited, it is reasonable to believe that VR-based   educational systems give benefits to learning.   The additional benefit of a VR educational environment is it   allows for a rapid, automatic, and personalized feedback system.    Environments can be created that are tailored for each individual   based on personality factors, learning styles, and level of   knowledge about a subject. Additionally, the environment itself   can be altered in real-time based on the learners current   experience, attentional state or level of engagement, performance   on the task, or other cognitive or biological shifts that might cause   changes in behavior. There are a large number of specific   environmental changes that could be used, and which choice   would be optimal for improving learning would likely depend on   the particular task, as well as the individual. However, based on   research on effective feedback, these VR interventions likely   should rapidly direct attention to highlight important information   about the task at hand.   In order to provide these effective VR interventions, data that is   predictive of success must be collected from the learner.  Ideally,   multiple measures would be extracted in order to improve   accuracy, as a single measure is unlikely to be sufficient.    However, data based on behavioral output from the learner, such   as a response on a test, may not be informative as to the actual   internal mental state of the individual.  A better tool to measure   this is EEG.   3. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY  EEG is a non-invasive neuroimaging method that measures   electrical activity from the brain through sensors or electrodes   placed on the scalp [25]. The measured brain activity represents   the summed postsynaptic potentials (both excitatory and   inhibitory) of thousands of neurons whose firing is synchronous in   time [26, 27].  Given issues of volume conduction and spread of   electrical signals, the majority of EEG signals are likely generated   by cortical pyramidal neurons, although it remains possible that   subcortical structures do contribute [28]. Successful measurement   of EEG signals also depends on the spatial orientation of firing   cells  neurons that are parallel to each other and perpendicular to   the cortical surface will sum more effectively. Thus, it is   essentially impossible to determine exactly which structures of the   brain are responsible for the recorded signal on the scalp   (although modern computational methods can make reasonable   guesses and approximations [29]). Despite this drawback, EEG   allows for recording of brain activity with very high temporal   resolution, on the order of milliseconds. This is essential for   capturing rapid dynamics of brain activity including neural   oscillations, or rhythmic neural firing at different frequencies that   is critical for information processing [30]. This is also particularly   useful for feedback-related applications, as interventions can be   applied much more quickly.   EEG is also very useful for applied educational work because   behavioral output from the learner is not required to obtain a   signal  the brain will respond to stimuli whether or not a physical   response is made. Decades of cognitive and neuroscientific   research has demonstrated that EEG does in fact provide   informative signal that can be leveraged.  For example, induced   power in the alpha rhythm of the EEG  a neural oscillation in the   8-12 Hz range  is related to attention and visual processing of   information [31, 32]. Additionally, the phase of the ongoing alpha   rhythm is predictive of successful processing of visual stimuli [33,   34].  Thus, by measuring ongoing alpha power, we can have some   understanding of a learners attentional state, and immediately   modulate the virtual environment if attention is waning.    Additionally, we can track the phase of the alpha oscillation to   time the presentation of information and optimize its encoding.   EEG is not only useful for measuring broad state changes and low   level perceptual processing, but is also effective at measuring   higher level cognitive and mental processes. Predictive and   reliable EEG measures of successful episodic memory encoding   [35, 36], emotional operations [37], processing of semantics and   meaning [38], and second-language learning [39] have been   identified.  Thus, EEG is not simply another method of measuring   level of arousal; it potentially allows teachers to identify mental   states and cognitive processes in real-time, making it an ideal tool   for an educational feedback system.   4. PRELIMINARY DATA  We have described an idealized closed loop educational feedback   system combining VR and EEG. The actual utility of such a   system must be validated empirically. Additionally, combining   EEG and VR presents multiple technical hurdles; EEG   measurements must be sent in real-time to the VR environment   controller, and EEG data artifacts produced by head movements   and eyeblinks must be dealt with. Here, we present preliminary   data from 12 participants during an experiment designed as a first   pass to combine EEG and VR.   4.1 Experimental Design  The procedure was a visual working memory task developed with   the Unity3D game engine. The task was completed by all   participants both in VR and on in front of a computer screen with     a mouse. In a fairly simple virtual space, floating stimuli   (truncated icosahedrons) appeared in random locations from a pre-  defined set of possible locations. After appearing, the stimuli   would change to random colors for 1 sec, and then turn back to   gray for a delay of 1.1 sec. Following the delay, the floor of the   virtual environment would change to a color that one of the   stimuli had previously been. The participants then had to interact   with a stimulus to indicate which of the stimuli presented had   been that color. If correct, the stimulus exploded and the next trial   began; if incorrect, the stimulus shrunk to nothing and the next   trial began.   The task was adaptive, such that the number of stimuli presented   was dependent on the participants performance. At the start of   the experiment, 3 stimuli were presented. If the participant got a   trial correct, a counter would move up 1; if incorrect, down 1. If   the counter reached +3 or -3, the number of stimuli would   increase or decrease, respectively. Each participant completed 20   minutes of trials in the VR condition and 20 minutes in the non-  VR condition.   In the non-VR condition, participants were seated in front of a   computer monitor and interacted with stimuli by clicking a mouse.   In the VR condition, participants wore an HTC Vive VR headset   and interacted with stimuli using a handheld motion controller.    The Vive uses room-scale tracking, so participants could walk up   to stimuli and interact with them. In both conditions, participants   wore an InteraXon Muse EEG headband during the task to record   EEG data. The Muse is a consumer headset with 4 channels (2   frontal, 2 temporal), a 200 Hz sampling rate, and wireless   capabilities. Although a consumer headset may not provide as   clean of a signal as a medical grade EEG system, other work has   shown that mental states can still be classified with the Muse [40],   and demonstrating success with a consumer-grade headset   provides ecological validity, as real-life educational applications   will likely use consumer products.   Behaviorally, participants did not perform any better or worse in   VR compared to non-VR. Previous studies have found benefits   when performing tasks in VR, although these benefits are likely   somewhat task-dependent, and simpler, less complex tasks may   not lead to large improvements [41]. Thus, the simplicity of our   working memory task may have reduced the benefits of VR.    However, our primary goal was not to show large benefits of VR   usage  this experiment represents a first step towards combining   VR and EEG for neurofeedback work, and using a simple   experiment with a learning component before moving to a more   complex learning environment may allow us to identify   informative EEG features.   4.2 EEG Data  Our goal with the EEG data was to identify neural features that   differentiated trials in which participants made a correct response   from trials in which they didnt. Importantly, we examined data   during the encoding period of the task  while participants were   viewing the colored stimuli prior to the delay period.    Theoretically, this is when subjects were encoding information to   be retained in memory. If neural signals already differentiate   accurate and inaccurate choices at this time, then interventions   could be applied in real-time to lead subjects to successful   learning prior to a response even being made.   4.2.1 Event Related Potentials  We first examined event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to   the onset of the stimuli to be remembered [42]. ERPs are   measured by baseline correcting the EEG data for each individual   trial, and then averaging the trials together to create an average   response related to the stimulus. We used a baseline period of 100   ms prior to the onset of the stimuli, and filtered the data with a 16   Hz low-pass Butterworth filter to reduce noise. Plotted in Figures   1 & 2 are the grand average ERPs (averaged across subjects) of   correct vs. incorrect responses in the VR and non-VR conditions   for the temporal channels. Frontal channels were not plotted, as   the data were noisy and inconclusive.      Figure 1. ERPs from the non-VR condition during the   encoding period.  Amplitude change is plotted on the Y axis,   time (including baseline) is plotted in sec on the X axis.    Stimulus onset is at time 0. Blue lines are correct, red lines are   incorrect.      Figure 2. ERPs from the VR condition during the encoding   period.  Amplitude change is plotted in sec on the Y axis, time   (including baseline) is plotted on the X axis.  Stimulus onset is   at time 0. Blue lines are correct, red lines are incorrect.   Looking at the ERPs, it is clear that there are differences between   correct and incorrect responses during the time of encoding.   Interestingly, the large negative-going component 300 ms after   the onset of the stimulus is earlier in the VR condition, and the     differences between correct and incorrect are larger. A t-test on   the mean amplitudes between 250-400 ms across correct and   incorrect was trending toward significance (p = 0.061) in the right   temporal channel. It is unclear why the magnitude of this effect   would be larger in VR  while it is tempting to view it as a neural   correlate of immersion or spatial awareness in VR, caution must   be taken, as movement and eyeblink artifacts could contribute.   4.2.2 Time-Frequency Analysis  To examine stimulus related oscillatory activity, we performed   time-frequency analysis [43]. We computed the Fast Fourier   Transform (FFT) of 250 ms windows of the encoding period that   were tapered with a Hanning function. Each window had an 87%   overlap with the previous window. We also computed the FFT of   a 250 ms pre-stimulus baseline for each trial. After averaging   spectral data from each trial, we performed baseline correction by   Decibel conversion (10 * log(activity / baseline)). Thus, the   figures plotted display changes in power relative to baseline   across the encoding time period for the temporal channels.   Examining figures 3 & 4, we can see similarities between the VR   and non-VR conditions. First, there was an early decrease in alpha   (12 Hz) power from approximately 0-300 ms, followed by a later   increase in alpha power. Alpha effects were significant in the   early time window in the left channel (p = 0.0437) and trending   toward significance in the late time window (p = 0.0543) only in   the VR condition. Additionally, in both VR and non-VR, there   was a decrease in high beta (30-40 Hz) power from approximately   0-300 ms in correct responses relative to incorrect responses.   Average power was computed at approximately 28-33 Hz and 38-  43 Hz from roughly 0-270 ms in both channels, and these power   values were submitted to t-tests.  The lower range (28-33 Hz)   effect was significant for non-VR (p = 0.025) and VR (p = 0.044)   in the left channel only, while the higher range (38-43 Hz) effect   was significant only for VR in the right channel (p = 0.0428).   5. CONCLUSION  Here we have given a theoretical overview of a closed-loop   educational feedback system in which neurobiological signals   from the learner shape the virtual learning environment to   optimize learning. We also presented preliminary experimental   data that suggests such a predictive model is feasible, as we were   able to identify features in the EEG data that differentiated correct   and incorrect responses at the time of encoding. Future efforts will   attempt to use these features for machine learning classification of   correct vs. incorrect responses, with the eventual goal of having a   model that can accurately perform this discrimination in real-time   and intervene to improve performance. Statistically, time-  frequency responses were more robust, particularly in the VR   condition, suggesting these features may be more useful.    Important technical hurdles must still be overcome  the main   being removing artifacts from the EEG data. Eyeblinks and head   movements can create large fluctuations that mask the informative   signal. This problem is exacerbated when using a wireless   commercial headset, as the occasional signal dropout and   dropping of samples leads to even more noise. The Muse   presented an additional problem with the frontal channels  the   proximity of these channels to the reference, and to eye muscles,   resulted in highly noisy data that was mostly uninformative.   Additionally, with only a few electrodes, conventional methods   for artifact removal such as ICA [44] are mostly unsuccessful.    More advanced signal processing methods, such as adaptive   filtering [45], will be necessary to achieve high classification   accuracy, and will be critical for real-time implementation.   An important question is whether an EEG-VR intervention system   would be the most optimal system for enhancing learning.   Theoretically, interventions could occur before the participant   even makes an error, and if the participant is unaware of their   error, they may not learn as well.  In other words, errors can be   informative, and intervening before errors may not be the best   thing to do. We propose that there are multiple reasons why an   individual might make an error, including incorrect knowledge   about the problem, and lack of attention or encoding. If the   individual has incorrect knowledge, post-error learning might be   more useful; however, if the error is simply due to lack of   attention, a pre-error intervention might be more useful.  An EEG-  VR feedback system would allow for both types of interventions.         Figure 3. Time-frequency plots of the encoding period of the   non-VR condition.
