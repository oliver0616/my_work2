Two game-inspired courses were  developed at a high-enrollment public university in an effort to  increase student engagement, and to provide students with more  personalized learning experiences. We designed a learning  management system, GradeCraft, to foreground the affordances of  these grading systems, and to enhance the game-like experience  for students. Along with serving as a translation layer for the  grading systems of these courses, GradeCraft is also designed  with an eye towards learning analytics, and captures information  that can be described as student process data. Currently this data  includes what types of assignments students choose to complete;  how students assign percentage weights to their chosen  assignments; how often and how accurately students check or  model their course grades; and how successfully assignments are  completed by students individually and the class as a whole across  a structured grading rubric. We hope GradeCraft will give  instructors new insight into student engagement, and provide data- driven ideas about how to tailor courses to student needs.

INTRODUCTION  In our experience, discussions around learning analytics often  begin with the tongue-in-cheek question: Wheres the learning  This question points to a real concern within the field, namely,  that there can be an overemphasis on the analytics (i.e., predictive   models, data mining to detect patterns, etc.) and far too little  emphasis on applying this knowledge to contexts where student  outcomes can be improved (i.e., the learning). Systems like  Purdues Course Signals represent a step in the right direction  because they begin to tackle the open question of wheres the  learning by providing students with grade feedback that helps  them adjust their strategies within a given course to be more  successful [2]. We see this work as valuable and worthy of future  development, but our approach towards learning analytics is  slightly different.   Instead of working within established university courses, we have  sought to reify the complex grading systems of non-traditional  game-inspired courses and have used the opportunity to capture  student data that speaks to the process through which they reach  course outcomes. In so doing we deliberately sit at the nexus of  learning analytics and gamification. While these data are  generally descriptive in nature at this point, we see this as a  subject for iterative design; as courses evolve, so too will our  understanding of the data that we need to collect and analyze.  Why game-inspired, however Good games typically inspire  players to spend large amounts of time and effort achieving in- game success. Well-designed games succeed because they tap into  our deep-seated desire to learn and be engaged. They give players  multiple ways to succeed, maximize choice, and mitigate the cost  of failure [4]. Educators over the last decade have been inspired  by the depth of content learned and the high-intensity effort that  gamers choose to put in when engaged in a good game [6].  Similarities that commonly exist between games and school  include well-defined goals at the outset, the establishment of  specific challenges to be conquered, requiring practice to succeed,  and using assessments to gauge whether material has been  properly learned. These parallels led to the question of whether  school itself could be made into a good game.   We are currently seeing the first wave of game-inspired courses at  our university. These courses aim to increase student choice while  mitigating the negative impact of failure. Gameful elements we  have observed include: using points and incremental levels instead  of grades; awarding badges to recognize achievements and skill- acquisition; allowing students to redo certain assignments as many  times as necessary to succeed; and giving students the ability to  decide what types of assignments they will take on and how much  those assignments will be worth. Thus far our research indicates  that the frame shift of these grading systems is motivating and  encourages students to complete more work within the course [3].    Given the complexities and choices inherent in a game-inspired  grading system, it can be difficult for students to quickly and  intuitively grasp the options available to them, and also tricky for  instructors to manage. To alleviate these issues we developed     Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

This design brief describes the current application and  the nascent Learning Analytics potential of GradeCraft.    1.1 Case Study: Videogames & Learning  GradeCraft was initially developed to support an elective class on  Videogames & Learning at a high-enrollment American public  university. The goal of this course is to examine the learning and  motivational theories that operate withinand inform the design  ofvideogames. Rather than treat this content abstractly, the  course grading system is infused with gameful design principles.  The course has required assignments in addition to a series of  optional assignments. While completing all of the assignments is  possible, it involves more work than is necessary to do well in the  course. The variety of assignment options is an example of giving  students multiple routes to successa key principle that makes  videogames motivating [4].    These assignments are divided into three categories: Grinding  assignments are characterized as necessary for learning the  content, but are not always as engaging as other assignments,  including attendance, weekly reading reactions, blogging, and  team activities; Learning From Playing A Game assignments  center on students reflecting and commenting on a commercial  videogame they have chosen to play throughout the termtheir  game textand are required for all students; Boss Battle  assignments are longer, more complex, and require a certain level  of content mastery to complete successfully. As a result, Boss  Battle assignments occur near the end of the term.    Optional assignments in this course may be used as a pathway to  exceed the courses main requirements (because a student wants  an A+, perhaps) or as a way to regain points that were lost as a  result of being absent from class, missing a reading reaction, or  simply performing poorly on a required assignment. This latter  path is an example of how a game-inspired grading system can  mitigate the cost of localized failure in coursework, thereby  allowing students the opportunity to self-correct, complete the  stated learning goals, and succeed in the overall course.   Badges were introduced in the third iteration of the course to  highlight specific skills the instructor wanted students to learn, but  earning them did not contribute value towards the final grade.    1.2 Case Study: Intro. to Political Theory  GradeCraft is also currently being used in a political science  course at the same university. The professor, hoping to increase  student motivation and encourage mastery-driven learning,  designed the following gameful grading system:   Forty percent of a students final grade is traditional in that it  consists of a core set of requirements: attending lectures, writing  weekly reading reactions, and attending teaching assistant led  discussion sections. These requirements are designed to provide a  core set of content knowledge and a common course experience.  The remaining sixty percent of a students grade is determined by  two student-driven decisions:   First, students must choose what types of assignments will make  up the remaining sixty percent of their grade. There are four  assignment types to choose from during the term: traditional  essays, an open-ended group project, an open-ended individual  project, and contributing to the class blog. Students are  encouraged to work on two of the four assignment types, but are  allowed to select any number.   Second, students are given the freedom to determine how each of  the four assignment types is weighted. This decision is  operationalized by giving students six points to spend on any  assignment type they wish. These points determine the weight of  each assignment they select and have no inherent valuethey are  only meant to simplify the process of determining how the  assignments they choose to do are weighted. A student can, for  example, assign all six points to academic essays. Doing so  amounts to the student choosing to focus only on writing essays.    Finally, students are awarded badges that either recognize or  incentivize certain behaviors. These badges are valued at up to  twenty-five percent of the students grade.    The remainder of this design brief will explore how these choice- driven grading systems are reified through the GradeCrafts  student and instructor interfaces as well as explore the  implications for the kind of data collected by GradeCraft.   2. GRADECRAFT  GradeCraft allows for three types of users: students, teaching  assistants, and instructors. For the purposes of this paper we will  collapse the teaching assistant and instructor roles, as they are  functionally similar. At its core GradeCraft is a comprehensive  dashboard that allows students to see their course performance in  a single view, much like the dashboard of a videogame. The  instructor dashboard displays a summary of students, sections, and  the overall class performance across a variety of metrics.   We will illustrate the analytics displayed through a series of  hypothetical situations, beginning with reviewing what a student  sees in GradeCraft.   2.1 The Student Perspective  Upon logging into GradeCraft, a student sees their current score, a  chart of the points they have earned so far, and a chart of the  points that are available to earn throughout the entire course.       Figure 1: Student Dashboard    The dashboard shows students up-to-date grade information for  their course. These descriptions are intended to be both  informative and empowering because students have a summary  view of their performance, and see a decomposed view of  performance by assignment type (Figure 1). This information can  be buried in traditional courses, and its inclusion reflects a growth  model of learningstudents are shown that their current progress  can be altered through effort and forward planning for future  assignments.    On their dashboard, students can also see which badges they have  earned, their progress towards completing unearned badges, and  which badges their classmates have earned. They can notify  instructors that they have completed a specific task on the path to  earning a badge.   261      Figure 2: Badges for understanding course content     Course objectives are also displayed on a student's dashboard,  allowing them to visualize their progress towards these  overarching goals. This helps orient students to the greater  purpose of the course, rather than just their grades.       Figure 3: Visualizing Learning Objectives     To that end, one goal we have is for GradeCraft to encourage  students to be less concerned with grades and more focused on  mastering skills by completing assignments and earning badges.  To this end, we have chosen not to display course grades on the  student dashboard by default. However, we recognize that we are  working within a dominant educational paradigm where grade  information is highly sought after, so students can click the  "Check My Final Grade" button in order to see how their current  score would translate into a final course grade. This information is  recorded, and allows instructors to know which students are  focused on this outcome. Such information could inform future  course design or pedagogical strategies.        Figure 4: Checking Their Grade     Students can also check how their current score compares to the  class average by clicking "How Am I Doing" (Figure 5). This  displays a box-and-whisker plot intended to help students gauge  their performance against the rest of the class. We opted not to use  leaderboards because they can be de-motivating to low-ranked  students/players.       Figure 5: Checking Class Standing      We believe giving students meaningful choices (ones that have an  impact on how they will play the game") is crucial to designing a  good game [5][7]. Students in the political science course  mentioned above are able to select which assignments they will do  and how much of their grade those assignments will be worth. But  how do they make these complex calculations We built a grade  prediction tool to help them in this process. When the predictor is  first loaded, the bar chart fills with any points they've already  earned, broken down by assignment type.        Figure 6: The Grade Predictor     The student can page through each assignment type, selecting how  many assignments they plan to do, how well they believe they will  score on them, and if applicable, how they would like to weight  that assignment type. Students are thus able to model their  performance, taking more responsibility for their choices than is  typical in college syllabi. GradeCraft captures these modeling  instances, allowing instructors and researchers to begin to  understand the process behind how students make course  engagement decisions.    The predictor stays in sync with the student throughout the  semester, showing them their current score at any given moment,  and allowing them to assess what work must be done to earn a  particular grade. The predictor also acts as a resource, displaying  links to materials and tools recommended by the instructor to help  students complete the assignment.   2.2 The Instructor Perspective  When initially setting up a course in GradeCraft, instructors can  declare the overarching course objectives. As they create  assignment types and badges, each one can be tagged with the  relevant course objectives.   Instructors can then visualize exactly how their objectives are  distributed across the entire course per activity, and in relation to  the grading scheme. This helps instructors to see if their learning  objectives are fully represented in the course structure or if there  are elements that need clearer application.        Figure 7: Learning Objectives Assignment Breakdown     262    Instructors can create badges to encourage the development of  particular attributes, skills, or actions that they feel are important  for their students to have or do. Each badge has a set of criteria  that must be accomplished in order for a student to earn it.  Instructors can easily view which badges have been earned, how  often, and when. They can also see which badges students are  working on, which criteria have been marked complete, and  which are proving more difficult for students to achieve.        Figure 8: Badge Analytics     Standard access datalogin count, page views, resources  accessedprovide the basic framework within which instructors  can first begin to investigate student engagement. Instructors can  view an interactive table displaying student and class statistics, on  these metrics. While this data is possible to collect in all learning  management systems, displaying these metrics for instructors use  is not frequently taken advantage of. Making this data plainly  available to instructors allows them to have a richer understanding  of how their students are choosing to engageor disengage, as  the case may bewith their course. With this information  instructors can intervene as necessary to improve student  outcomes.      Figure 9: Student Activity     When approaching the mid-point of the semester, a professor  viewing the engagement charts could, for example, sort students  by their attendance record and schedule conversations with  students who have missed a high percentage of classes.  Alternatively, an instructor might notice that a student who had  been performing well in the course suddenly stopped attending  and has not been turning in assignments. This acts as an early  warning system, suggesting to the instructor that something has  changed and that they should contact the student while it is still  relatively easy for the student to recover from the situation.   Students also need feedback regarding their class performance and  guidance as to what else they should be doing. GradeCraft gives  students direct access to analytics that can help answer these  questions, and also provides instructors with further material to  support conversations with students regarding what additional  work they can do in the course. Instructors can see each student's  dashboard view, visualize how well they have completed the  comprehensive learning objectives, and check where the student  has ranked in completing each assignment.    In discussing with students what their specific path through the  course is, instructors can use the predictor tool to keep track of the  choices a student has made, and make recommendations regarding  future work. GradeCraft logs the choices students make in the  predictor and what final grade these selections ultimately produce.  Instructors can see students predicted final grade charted over  time, and drill down to explore which specific assignments a  student was considering doing, and how well they expected to do  on any particular assignment.        Figure 10: Self-Predicted Final Grades Over Time     If instructors know when students deviate negatively (through  missing assignments or lower than expected scores) from their  original intentions on an assignment, they can predict earlier in  the course timeline which students may be in need of support.  This is an improvement on current early warning systems, which  rely on comparing a students behavior to previous classes or  current classmates. The unit of analysis in GradeCraft is the  course itself, rather than the academic histories students bring  with them. These histories cannot fully capture the nuance of a  student performing differently than they themselves had intended.   GradeCraft allows instructors to visualize which assignment types  students choose to complete, and how much weight they decide to  assign them. Mapping these choices back to students final grades  will help us investigate if students know their own skills and  choose to weight them higher, or if students weight things so as to  reduce the risk of working on assignment types they are less  familiar with. Given that one of the long-term goals of game- inspired grading systems is to encourage students to explore new  types of activities and broaden their skill sets, tracking this  relationship will be key to understanding if the frame change is  successful in achieving this goal. We need to understand how  students perceive risk-taking in relation to assignment type  selection, and how to incentivize this behavior to achieve the best  learning outcomes.   263    Clearly-designed rubrics have the advantage of helping students  understand explicitly what is expected of them and how they  should direct their efforts, provide a more concrete avenue for  instructor feedback, and reduce bias in grading [1]. To support  these goals, we designed an interactive grading rubric, allowing  instructors to set categories, enter criteria and scoring guidelines,  and then select how students had fared on each criterion. These  assessments build to a final score on the assignment.    From these selections instructors can then explore how well  students complete their work from the perspective of these  criteria. An instructor might create the category of Writing Skill  in a long-form essay rubric, with the criteria of Spelling &  Grammar, Clarity of Thought, and Supported by Research.  When the grading has been completed, the instructor can then see  how students individually, as a section, and as a class did on each  criteria. Different levels of success would have implications for  student, section, and class interventions, explanations, and greater  understanding of what the class as a whole needs to be taught in  order to succeed.        Figure 11: Class Criterion Score for Poster Assignment      3. FUTURE WORK  To date the development of GradeCraft has been focused on the  construction of the core LMS functionality and the gathering of  data to power basic learning analytics. Our next task is to take the  analytic information on student behavior and return it to the  instructor and the student in more meaningful, nuanced ways.  Currently an instructor can load the profile of any student to check  their raw activity statistics. However, especially in large courses,  this effort is both unwieldy to perform and a simplistic analysis at  best. Therefore, we intend to build a tool that allows the instructor  to establish a series of metrics that singly, or in combination,  create grounds for identifying students of concern, i.e., those  with specific characteristics that suggest the desirability of review  and potential contact by the instructor.  In keeping with the gameful nature of the system, we also intend  to build a health bar for students to review course progress. This  tool could be set to mirror the instructors early warning system  metrics, or be based on entirely separate criteria. For instance, an  instructor might choose to have the students health bar be fifty  percent reflective of attendance and fifty percent based on their  performance across course learning objectives. Absence from  class would be marked by diminished health, which could be  regained by doing other optional activities like blogging. Poor  performance on learning objectives, as assessed via the interactive  grading rubrics, would also decrease a students health. Revising   and resubmitting the assignment in question, or completing an  alternative assignment to show improvement on that learning  objective, would serve to boost the students health bar.    4. CONCLUSIONS  GradeCraft gives educators access to new types of analytics that  are focused on learning because of the multiple points at which  students interact with the system. Rather than simply drilling  down into a letter grade and examining the parts that constitute  it, GradeCraft collects data that speaks to process and decisions. It  captures which assignments students choose to complete, how  students weight those assignments, how students did in regards to  completing specific assignment rubrics, and which badges were  awarded throughout the course. Each of these decisions is  captured, and it is our hope that the resulting data will yield  valuable insights about student behavior within game-inspired  courses. It is our hope that GradeCraft foregrounds the  affordances of the game-inspired grading systems in such a way  as to make complicated decisions clear, while also yielding data  that speaks to student processes, as opposed to simply reporting  student outcomes.    5.
