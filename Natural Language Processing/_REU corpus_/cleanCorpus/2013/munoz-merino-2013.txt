In this paper, we propose a set of high level learning   parameters relating to total use, efficient use, activity time   distribution, gamification habits, or exercise-making habits, and   provide the measures to calculate them as a result of processing   low level data. We apply these parameters and measures in a real   physics course with more than 100 students using the Khan   Academy platform at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. We show   how these parameters can be meaningful and useful for the   learning process based on the results from this experience.

INTRODUCTION  An analogy can be established between learning and the business   sector, where the use of data mining techniques and business   intelligence tools [1] has become widespread in companies. A big   issue for business intelligence is how to deal with thousands of   data that are difficult to understand and convert these into high   level meaningful information that can be used as a basis for   decision making by organizational stakeholders [2]. We are   looking for the same outcome in the e-learning area.   We understand low level learning data to be the collection of   event entities and all their related data (e.g., time or resources   involved), which are usually stored in a database. They do not   usually convey any meaningful sense alone, but if we process   them properly, then useful information can be obtained. Our   motivation for this work is to transform a huge amount of low   level learning data into high level parameters that can be   meaningful for students and teachers, in order to answer questions   such as: Can this user be motivated by gamification techniques   In this work, we define a collection of high level learning   parameters that give insights into the learning process. These   parameters are calculated based on low level data. We have   applied these parameters to the Khan Academy1 platform,   extending the Khan Academy learning analytics module. Some   cases and results show the importance and meaningfulness of   these parameters for the learning process. We illustrate them in   our case study on a physics course using the Khan Academy   platform with more than 100 students.   2. RELATED WORK  The collection of low level educational data is very important.   Approaches such as Contextualized Attention Metadata (CAM)   [3] allow the retrieval of all the events from distributed sources.   The data can be collected in different formats, such as the   Resource Description Framework (RDF) [4].   Low level educational data as well as high level information have   been reported in different works. Some of the approaches [5, 6]   focus on the prediction of events by applying data mining   techniques and statistical methodologies. Other works present   practical specific visualization tools such as goals, activities, or   number of events per item [7], social network visualizations in the   CAMERA tool [8], or resources used, average time spent per   resource, or the evolution of the students in the SAM tool [9].   However, there are many new high level information parameters   that have not been addressed by the literature.    We present some high level information parameters that have   been applied to the Khan Academy platform. These parameters   were not present in the Khan Academy learning analytics module,   so we extended it. Some of the parameters relating to exercise   solving habits (e.g., hint abuse) have already been presented in the   literature (e.g. in [10]), but we have adapted the method of   calculating them as the semantic of the Khan Academy platform is   different from the Geometry Cognitive Tutor framework [10].     3. EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT   An instance of the Khan Academy software is installed on our   own application server2. This instance is personalized with our   own pages, badges, etc. Specific materials, including videos and   exercises, were developed at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid for   a course on physics and were uploaded onto our instance of the   Khan Academy software. The course comprised a complete set of   27 videos and 35 exercises. This course took place in August 2012   over the entire month. More than 100 students were registered on   the course, which is a review of prerequisites that the students   should know before starting an engineering degree.                                                                     1 https://www.khanacademy.org/    2 http://uc3m-ka.appspot.com/       Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are   not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that   copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Figure 1 shows an exercise example based on the scalar product   running on our own Khan Academy instance. Each exercise has a   related video (4) and usually some hints (3). Exercises can be   parametric (1). When a student accesses an exercise, this exercise   will not change (even if it is accessed at different moments) until   the student solves it correctly. The next time that the exercise is   accessed, a new exercise on that same topic is obtained, with only   the parametric values changing. In order to be proficient at a   certain exercise, considering maximum efficiency, a student must   complete eight exercises correctly in a row without asking for any   hint (5) and answering correctly at the first attempt (2).   Khan Academy also incorporates gamification aspects such as   points that users can earn. Moreover, a student can win badges,   e.g., by achieving proficiency in a certain group of exercises or   topics.   In order to calculate these high level parameters, a set of python   scripts using the Google App Engine (GAE) API were developed   since Khan Academy runs over GAE infrastructure.   4. PROPOSED PARAMETERS  In this section we propose a set of high level information   parameters and show how to obtain them from the processing of   the low level data. The parameters are grouped into five blocks.   4.1 Total Use of the Platform  These parameters do not take into account if a user has done very   well or badly, but only the total use of the platform.   4.1.1 Total Effective Use of the Platform (TUP)  We denote the total available exercises and videos as AE and AV,   respectively. In the case of videos, we use two measures: one for   completed videos (CV) and another for started videos (SV):                                        Three measures are proposed for exercises relating to: the number   of different types of exercises a student attempted (DEA), that a   student spent enough time (DET), and that a student attempted at   least some number of times or solved correctly (DEN).                                                             Moreover, a global measure of total use of videos plus exercises is   possible, taking into account a weight for different videos and   exercises for all presented measures.   4.1.2 Total Efficient Use of the Platform (TEP)  In the case of videos, a measure is proposed: dividing the   maximum possible video time length (TVL) by the total time   spent on completed videos by the user (TEV). Therefore, if a user   repeats watching a video, his efficiency will decrease:                     Two parameters are proposed for exercises: the total number of   exercises attempted (TEA) divided by DEA gives a measure of   the number of times a user repeats his exercises on average; the   total time invested in all exercises (TTE) divided by the total   normal estimated time (TNT) gives a measure of whether the   student spent more time than expected, on average, on solving   exercises.                                        4.1.3 Total Time and Use of Optional Items  The total time on platform (TT) is the time (in minutes) that a user   has spent with exercises (TTE) and videos (TTV). This time can   exceed the real time a user has spent interacting with videos and   exercises, because they can have the video or exercise windows   open without watching videos or doing exercises.   Moreover, the platform offers several features that are not   mandatory to use in an educational environment, e.g., for our   Khan Academy environment the profile personalization or the   establishment of goals. We measure with this parameter if the   student is motivated by features of the platform other than the   normal ones. A simple example of this measure can be to   distinguish people who had some interaction with an optional item   from people who did not.    4.2 Correct Progress on the Platform  This block contains parameters that represent how well users have   interacted with the platform. This block does not take into account   the total use but the performance of the student with the materials.   4.2.1 Effective Correct Progress on the Platform  (ECP)  Correct progress on the platform for videos can be given as the   percentage time of all the videos that have been watched, although   other video measures presented for total use might also be used.   For exercises, three measures are proposed:      is the total  correct exercises (TCE) divided by the minimum total number of   correct exercises to obtain proficiency (8 in the case of the Khan   Academy platform) and multiplied by AE, with a limit so that   TCE for each type of exercise cannot be greater than 8;      is  the number of proficiencies achieved (UP) divided by AE;       is the total progress, that is the average of the progress on all   exercises, to obtain proficiency. Each exercise has a related   progress for each student from 0 to 1 depending on the number of   correct exercises, incorrect attempts or hints used in that type.                                                                4.2.2 Efficient Correct Progress on the Platform  (EP)  The efficient correct progress on the platform for videos can be   the same as for the efficient total use. Regarding exercises, one   measure is defined as the division of the total different types of   exercises correctly solved (TDCE) by the total time spent in   solving them (TTE) and multiplied by the average expected time   to solve an exercise. This time has been set to 40 seconds for all   the exercises of our Khan Academy educational environment.   Another measure is the division of TCE by TEA:                                                    113    In addition, a maximum time limit is set for the contribution of   each exercise to TTE (180 seconds for our case) so that noise is   not introduced for the measure.     values considerably less than  1 indicate non-efficient users, and values considerably greater   than 1 indicate that users solve many exercises correctly in a   reduced amount of time.   4.3 Time Distribution of Use of the Platform  This section represents an analysis of the times when the user   interacted with the platform.    4.3.1 Total Working Schedules  These parameters show at what time users watch their videos and   do exercises. We set three time schedules (TS) by time intervals:   morning [7:00 to 13:59] (TM), afternoon [14:00 to 20:59] (TA)   and night [21:00 to 06:59] (TN). The percentages of use in each   time schedule are calculated.   4.3.2 Efficiency by Working Schedules  These parameters use the same time schedule as in the last   subsection, but in this case the efficiency (ESP) of the user doing   exercises is measured in each time interval.                                                                                                                We propose this measure aiming to find that some users might   work better at different times of the day.   4.3.3 Constancy of Users  This parameter checks if a user was studying in a constant way   during several days or was studying strongly only for a few days.   The sample mean and the variance of time spent on the platform   by day are calculated:                                                                           N being the number of days that the course took and x the time   spent each day. The learning constancy is calculated using the   sample variance of the time from each day, i.     4.4 Gamification Habits  Here we try to analyze whether a user is motivated by the   gamification elements. A measure related to user badges (UB) is   proposed. This parameter consists of the total number of badges   that the user has earned (EB) divided by the exercise correct   progress on the platform (ECP). A user that achieves more badges   than another on the platform (their correct progress on the   platform being the same) will be more motivated because of the   badges. In addition, if two users have earned the same number of   badges but have different exercise correct progress on the   platform, the one with better correct progress on the platform will   be less motivated by badges, because the more a user advances on   the platform correctly, the more badges he can earn.                   4.5 Exercise Solving Habits  These parameters represent the way a user solves an exercise.   4.5.1 Explorer or Recommendation Listener  Khan Academy allows users to define prerequisites between   exercises and also includes an exercise recommender. Therefore,   checking whether a user has accessed a certain number of   Acces to an   exercise  Answers   correctly Correct behaviorYES  Has user seen   related video  NO  Increase video   avoidance NO  Did user ask   for hints YES  Increase hint   avoidance NO  Did user   answered   reflexively  YES  Correct behavior  YES  Increase   unreflective user NO   Figure 2. Model flow diagram.   exercises according to the system recommendation will give us an   indication of whether a user usually follows the recommended   learning path (RL):                                4.5.2 Hint Avoidance, Video Avoidance, Unreflective  User and Hint Abuser  We propose a model that tries to cover all the possible situations   that a learner can encounter when interacting with an exercise on   the Khan Academy platform. Figure 2 shows this model. The flow   diagram starts at the point where a user is answering an exercise.   If the user answers correctly, then the counter of correct behavior   is increased. If the answer is wrong, then the system checks   whether the student had watched the related video. If he did not   watch it, then the local value for video avoidance (VA) profile is   set to 1, otherwise is set to 0. Next, the system checks whether the   student requested for hints. If he did not, the local value for hint   avoidance (HAV) profile is set to 1, otherwise it will be a number   in the range [0,1] representing the percentage of requested hints   for that type of exercise. Lastly, if the student answers too fast,   (e.g., less than 10 seconds), then the local value for unreflective   user (US) profile is set to 1, otherwise is 0. It is important to note   that we apply this profile only until the student does one exercise   of that type correctly; otherwise we would be contaminating with   noise since the user already knows how to solve the problem and   subsequent similar problems as they are parametric.   Each time that a student accesses a different type of exercise, each   of the aforementioned parameters is set from [0, 1]. This is the   local value of the parameters for a type of exercises. The global   value of these parameters is the mean of all the local ones among   the exercises in which students had some interaction and where   these parameters were set to some value.   In addition, the hint abuser parameter takes into account the exact   time for the first hint as well as time intervals between hint   requests. For example, if a user starts an exercise and in less than   10 seconds he has already requested a hint, then the hint abuser   counter is increased. Similarly, if the time difference between two   hint requests is lower than 10 seconds the hint abuser counter is   also increased.   5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF THE  MEANING OF PARAMETERS  In this section, we show how the presented parameters have a   utility in the learning context. Moreover, we present typical   situations in our course where they can be used. We analyze their   meaning in the context of our Khan Academy educational   environment and present some illustrative results.    114     Figure 3. Exercises efficiency in time.   Although a total of more than 100 students interacted in the   course, we have not taken into account the ones who we consider   that did not interact enough; therefore the following results are   based on the analysis of 66 students.   The plan for the physics course is based on the methodology of   flipping the classroom, so that students prepare the lessons using   the Khan Academy platform in advance of face to face lessons. It   is important for teachers to know which students are prepared well   for the face to face lessons; therefore the parameters for the   effective correct progress on the platform are important. Based on   these parameters, teachers can set a threshold for considering   which students are prepared well, e.g., a minimum number of   completed videos or minimum number of exercises where   proficiency is obtained. Usually, teachers will set a combination   of conditions on these parameters to consider that a student is well   prepared for the face to face course (e.g., an AND of conditions or   a global measure taking everything into account with a weight).   Considering a minimum of 16 videos totally completed (from       ) or 21 exercises where a student obtained proficiency (from      ), we can say that 22 out of 66 students did well on the  platform and were well prepared for the face to face sessions.   Among the students who did well on the platform (passed this   threshold of correct progress), the measures of effectiveness give   us an idea of who was more effective in terms of time or less   repetition of items. Students who are not efficient in their learning   might be advised or guided so that they can take better advantage   of their time, because it is not only important to learn but to do so   in an efficient way.    The parameters relating to effectiveness can be given in the form   of graphs. Figure 3 shows a representation of     for the exercise  solving time efficiency for all students in our experiment. The   middle value line set upon 100 percent would be the average time   that a normal user should spend to solve the exercises. If students   are far above that line, it means that they solve the exercises faster   than the critical value, while students below the line need more   time per correct exercise. Therefore, two students can have similar   values of correct progress but one can be more efficient in time   (or number of attempts) than the other.   Among the students that did wrong on the platform (did not pass   the threshold of correct progress), the parameters of total use of   the platform will let us know whether the students made some   effort to learn and where (videos, exercises, time) or if they did   not make any effort. For example, for a time (TT) exceeding 225   minutes of interaction with the platform, and more than 15 started   videos (from     ), or more than 20 attempts at different types of  exercises (from     ), we can detect that 8 out of the 44 students  that did badly made a considerable effort on the platform. These   students might need more remedial support.   A Pearson correlation test shows that there is a statistically   significant difference at 99% level between the total time (TT)   and the following parameters: videos completed from       (r=0.80), videos started from      (r=0.81), exercises attempted  from      (r=0.71), and exercises with proficiency from       (r=0.73). Therefore, the total time is related strongly to these   measures, and it is a good parameter to predict the number and   quality of interactions with the platform.    Another important issue is to identify whether or not students are   motivated to achieve badges, and this is indicated by the   gamification habits parameters. Two students might have a strong   activity on the platform, but one of them might have a lot of   badges while the other has only a few badges, indicating that he is   not motivated by them. Students that are motivated by   gamification can be identified and participate in future   gamification activities.   The parameter of total use of optional elements gives information   about whether students were interested in extra functionalities of   the platform that were not mandatory and about which they were   not given any information. A total of 17 students used some type   of optional functionality. This may denote curiosity and identify   students who like to explore things. The Pearson correlation   between the use of optional items and the total time (r=0.16,   p=0.19) and the percentage of proficiencies obtained (r=0.3,   p=0.014) suggest that the use of optional items, or not, is not   strongly related to the total time of use of the platform or whether   or not the user obtains proficiency in exercises.   In addition, surprisingly, there was not a statistically significant   relationship between the use, or not, of optional items and the   recommender/explorer parameter from RL (r=0.1, p=0.42). One   might tend to think that students who use optional items would   tend to be explorers and not take into account the   recommendations, but this relationship was not found in the   experiment.   The parameters relating to constancy in learning give us an   indication of whether or not students learn in a constant way. The   variancebut also the meanshould be taken into account for   the interpretation. In many situations, students might learn better   for the long term if they do it in a constant way, so a system might   recommend non-constant students to learn in a more constant way   or hide some activities from them until some specific date.   Figure 4 shows the constancy measures (mean and variance)   applied to top users according to their activity on the platform   during a time interval from [01/08/2012] to [08/09/2012]. We can   see, for example, that user 4 is a constant student because his   variance is very low with respect to the mean. In the same way,   user 8 has not been learning in a constant way but only for a few   days. With a similar analysis we can reach conclusions for all the   users.   Moreover, time schedules where students spent more time and   where they were more efficient can be of interest, e.g., for   personalization of tasks to time slots.   115    Figure 4. Constancy measure applied to top users.   Finally, some help-seeking bugs, such as help abuse, are   correlated with learning gains according to the literature [10].   Therefore, knowing the exercise solving habits parameters is of   special importance as teachers can act and intervene to change the   behavior of students so that they can learn in a more effective   way.   Considering a level of more or equal than 25% as the threshold for   each of the problem solving habits parameters, we can say that   30.3 % of students had the profile of hint avoider, 25.8 % of video   avoider, 40.9 % of unreflective user and 12.1% of hint abuser.   In addition, table 1 shows the correlations among the different   categories of problem solving. The only correlations that are   statistically significant at the 99% level are 1) the unreflective   user with respect to hint abuser and hint avoider, which makes   sense as a user that does not reflect on his learning can select, or   not, a hint by chance, and 2) video and hint avoidance, which also   makes sense as a user who avoids hints can also have tendency to   avoid videos. In addition, the relationships that were not   statistically significant also make sense, e.g., the hint abuser with   respect to hint and video avoidance, as a user who tends to use   abuser techniques will not tend toward avoidance ones.    Table 1: Correlations among problem solving habits     Hint   avoid.   Video   avoid.

CONCLUSIONS  This paper proposes a set of high level parameters that can give   useful information for students and teachers about the learning   process, and we have illustrated it with a case study of more than   100 students using the Khan Academy platform. The information   obtained using our proposed parameters is not easy to obtain with   the present Khan Academy learning analytics module. For   example, if a teacher wants to know about problem solving habits,   he must go through different windows to see which videos a   student has watched, the time spent, and the details of the   resolution of each exercise and make many complex calculations.   The proposed parameters can be applied not only for the Khan   Academy platform but for other systems, incorporating the proper   adaptations. In this direction, the semantics of each platform   influences the types of parameters that can be used and the way to   measure them, e.g., the correct use of exercises can be redefined   in other platforms where the same exercise is not repeated to   obtain proficiency. In addition, on some occasions some   parameters cannot give useful information, for example, a student   may obtain all the badges and solve everything correctly, but we   cannot say that he is or is not motivated by the badges.    The results of this study can be applied for useful interventions,   for example, in recommender applications. Another challenge is   how to visualize all the information in an easy way for teachers.   7.
