In  particular for Higher Education we describe how the Virtual  World constructed using the platform Avaya Live Engage, is used  as an immersive environment with pre-service teachers, who are  undergoing a 1-year teacher training program, and how the data  analytics collected in-world is being used to monitor and direct  content development. We focus our studies on the initial  hypothesis that 3D immersive environments are highly engaging  and offer an experience that goes beyond the traditional online  education. We want to combine different analysis methods to be  able to get empirical evidence showing the students engagement  with the 3D space in ways that can help us in the design of the  learning experience accompanying the learners in their journey. In  this paper we describe the research methods we use for the study,  and give an overview of the information we can collect from the  in-world analytics. We also propose how these analytics can be  used for a predictive model with the intention of refocusing the  virtual world experience to match learner needs.

INTRODUCTION  Virtual Worlds (VWs) have been described as 3D representations   of real world communication structures, various interactions and  enterprise (Castronova, 2007). The author describes the way the  masses have embraced this medium as an exodus, whereby people  not only flock to the VWs and Virtual Realities, whether they are  immersed in games, or in any other form of activity held in the  cyberspace with motivations that extend beyond the fun element.  The short-term and long-term behavioral effects that VWs and  Virtual Reality have on people have also been at the center of  recent research studies (Blascovich & Bailenson, 2011). This  investigation aims to study the impacts of the 3D immersive space  on learner engagement manifested by changes in behavior. For  this investigation and in the case studies we are presenting we  work with AvayaLive Engage. The 3D platform is currently  being used by a number of leading enterprises to deliver  innovative corporate training experiences at all stages of the  employee learning cycle; from recruitment through on-boarding to  assigning new skills, leadership development and retention  activities. Learning analytics on the other hand may be considered  an exercise in educational data-mining, that uses traces left as  breadcrumbs by the users, in this case referred to as learners, to  be able to understand what the learners are doing and how they  are navigating through their learning experiences (Pardo &  Delgado Kloos, 2011). We describe learner engagement both in  terms of content presented as well as using the critical-democratic  perspective (Portelli & McMahon, 2004). For the latter, the  authors argue that a dynamic environment does not necessarily  imply critical-democratic engagement. Critical democracy in an  individual is described as the learners state of being that goes  beyond the physical classroom/university structure. This indicates  learning which is manifested over a much longer term than any  course duration. A number of universities and higher education  institutions are finding an increased need in moving/shifting their  courses towards the online environment. Administration in such  institutions as well as in corporate training, are using big data  analytics to provide numbers showing the learner/trainee  engagement with the content, as well as with the peers and/or  academic staff members. However Portelli & McMahon (2004)  argue that such levels of engagement might not run as deep into  the formation of a critical being, as is much needed in todays  society. A critical individual possesses skills such as critical  inquiry that does away with the traditional notions of education  and views learners as responsible, autonomous learners.

In our paper we discuss two case studies involving higher  education and corporate training respectively. We shall also give  an overview of the modalities for learning that have been chosen  for the two case studies and the dashboard that is currently being  used to obtain data revealing our learners immersive journey.  Section 2 of this paper will discuss some of the background into  virtual worlds and learning analytics whilst section 3 will describe  the methodology used in two distinct case studies involving  higher education and corporate training. Section 4 will give an  overview of some of the results that are obtained using the virtual  world analytics dashboard whilst section 5 will discuss the  possible implications of collecting big data for learning inside  immersive spaces and point towards possible future research in  the area especially for learning recommendation systems  integrated inside 3D immersive spaces.    2. BACKGROUND  In this section we shall be discussing some background into 3D  immersive spaces for learning, including some of the archetypes  that they support and how these have been shown to be conducive  to a deeper engagement level. We shall also be discussing some  of the assessment strategies that are used inside immersive spaces,  and the inferences that can arise from the assessment results. In  the second part of this section we shall discuss learning analytics  in terms of the different approaches that can be chosen, the  strengths and challenges of using data to trace learning paths as  well as the usefulness both in the corporate as well as in higher  education settings.    2.1 Immersion for learning  Immersion has been attributed a number of characteristics and  definitions in various contexts. Dede & Barab (2009) view  immersion in education as focusing more on the learner  experience and less on the tools used. This may also be in  agreement with a number of other researchers in the field. Calleja  (2011) views immersion, albeit from the gamer experience as  similar in that immersion does not simply depend on the high  fidelity of graphics and audio that is involved. Although these  certainly may help render experiences, more life-like much more  can be done in the design aspect to render experiences  authentic. Salen & Zimmerman (2004) emphasize that game  design should primarily focus around game mechanics that  stimulate engagement for true immersion to occur. Carpenter  (2009) describes the experiences in VWs as the connections,  which the users nurture as they interact with the 3D environment  and with the other personalities inhabiting the world. This applies  to both social virtual worlds as well as to game worlds, where the  individual acquires a second identity embodied in the persona of  an avatar. Dede (2009) describes how symbolic immersion can  have the power of stimulating psychological associations that  would be difficult to explain. For example, the author mentions  how fighting a terrifying monster can induce fear despite the fact  that the individual is physically located in the safety of their room.  Dede goes on to discuss how immersion in a digital environment  can augment the learning experience by facilitating an  environment sustaining multiple perspectives, situated learning  (also referred to as authentic experiences (Freedman, 2011)) as  well as transfer.    2.1.1 Archetypes in Virtual Worlds  The different archetypes inside virtual worlds are responsible for  different learning experiences that can be supported. Multiple   perspectives most often arise from the ability of the individuals  who are participative inside the 3D experience to interact and  collaborate. Messinger et al. (2009) describe the concept of a  shared workspace that brings together the people inside a 3D  immersive space in a way that they can collaborate, and share  their ideas. The difference between the 3D space, and any other  environment that might be used to bring people together in a spirit  of collaboration, is also found in the embodiment of the avatar and  the narrative or diegesis (de Freitas & Oliver, 2006) that is  constructed over their shared life experiences in a manner that  cannot be reconstructed over any other environment. Situated  Learning or authentic experience is another archetype that is  supported inside 3D immersive spaces. Galarneau (2005)  illustrates how the activities by avatars inside virtual worlds most  often mirror real life situations rendering the way they solve  problems more authentic. Freedman (2011) defines authentic as  learning which is contextualized into real life practices. Therefore  the setting and the context is of vital importance to 3D immersive  space design. Transfer of the learning experience inside the world  occurs through a number of interaction processes, including the  interactions between avatars, between the world objects and  beyond the world as the avatars keep digging deeper beyond the  3D space (Camilleri & Montebello, 2008).    2.1.2 Assessment in Virtual Worlds  Assessing learner engagement in 3D spaces is one of the  important metrics when considering uses of virtual worlds for  education. Whereas a number of assessment models in online or  traditional environments might require the assessment of lower  level knowledge transfer, research has indicated that virtual  worlds and 3D spaces can support different forms of assessment.  One such model is the exploratory model (de Freitas & Oliver,  2006) which features an open-ended design in learning (de  Freitas, Rebolledo-Mendez, Liarokapis, Magoulas, &  Poulovassilis, 2010). In this kind of learning, the learners are  responsible for tracing the path to their own learning as learning  in turn is much dependent on social interactions in-world.  Therefore the assessment in this kind of model is built around an  evaluative exercise of structured activities, feedback and the  learners reactions to the feedback. However there is still a gap in  the research as to how the assessment of the learning experience  can mirror the learning objectives set for that specific context. Our  future study intends to use learning analytics to be able to provide  data filling in that gap in research.    2.2 Learning Analytics  Siemens (2010) defines learning analytics as the use of  intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to  discover information and social connections, and to predict and  advise on learning. In this context data is collected from users, in  this case learners and harvested in a way that can make more  sense in the general learning objectives. In terms of assessment,  West (2012) describes how data mining and analytic software can  facilitate real-time assessment of learning experiences as  predictions can be drawn on the basis of patterns of behavior that  each learner traces in his/her individual online pathways. Within  the same report, the author presents a number of research findings  from other researchers, as they reveal how different data from the  different learning domains that is collected, harvested and  analyzed can be interpreted in multiple ways to facilitate and  support learning. In one case example, involving pre-service  teachers, engagement assessment is carried out on the basis of  pupil interactions in an online forum. Results were considered  very effective in the reflective teaching process. Bienkowski,  Feng, & Means (2012) differentiate between educational data   231    mining and learning analytics in terms of development and  application of tools for pattern identification and prediction of  learner experiences. de Laat et al. (2007) focus on Social Network  Analysis (SNA) as they investigate the role of socialization in  human-computer interaction during computer-supported  collaborative learning. This type of learning finds its theoretical  roots in the social-constructivist paradigm, which sees learning  happening within community practices. This type of community  setting is one of the important building blocks in the dynamics of  social and game-oriented 3D immersive spaces and is one that we  focus our study on. Further research work has also been carried  out on SNA for the analysis of interaction patterns in online  course, with the aim of overcoming at least one of the challenges  most often associated to the e-environment  a sense of isolation  that most often learners tend to report (Ferguson, 2012). SNA also  brought with it the advent of visualization of data spread across  the large connection nodes. These types of visual data analytics  help individuals make sense out of the emergent data patterns  whilst at the same time the real-time visualization of how each of  the individuals stand across a continuum of learning directions.    2.2.1 Data Visualization  This notion of data visualization is also discussed in detail in  Duval (2011). The openness with which data visualization occurs,  facilitates a sense-making process as the learners, and the teachers  go through the learning pathways. The author also combines the  visualization of data with the influence that online social networks  may have on the individual users behavior. The way that the  effectiveness of this visualization of data can be measured is in  the learners behavior as this gradually shapes up to different, new  tendencies. Data visualization is also described in terms of the  prediction of failures in learning, especially when a closed  monolithic framework, such as an LMS is used to collect and  trace data from. The difficulty with using an LMS to collect data  is that the data which is visualized is not always tantamount to the  amount of learning that goes on and that other sources may be  contributing to. This is one of the challenges mentioned by Pardo  & Delgado Kloos (2011) as they attempt to investigate the use of  virtual machines to collect large sets of data triggered by events  not necessarily set inside a Learning Management System. What  many researchers agree upon, is that the user of visualization of  data can be ultimately be used not just for the prediction of  failures or successes, but also for the possibility of personalization  and adaptation of the various learning instances to match with the  learner needs.    3. METHODOLOGY  3.1 Higher Education: a pre-service teacher  experience  For our investigation we have chosen a cohort of pre-service  teachers, following a 1-year teacher-training course at the Faculty  of Education, University of Malta. Our target research question is  How can we measure the engagement of our learners with the 3D  immersive space Our second question targets the behavioral  intention of our learners to keep up with the teaching and learning  practices they go through themselves during their in-world  residence. To be able to give a measure and assess their  engagement we are utilizing the dashboard from the Avaya Live  Engage platform that gives us information on the virtual presence  of our learners in-world and about the learners interactions with  the other avatars as well as with the in-world objects. The pre- service teachers are enrolled in a semester-long course, that is  delivered entirely in-world. All the content has been purposely  designed to meet the requirements of pre-service teacher training   in the domain of learning technologies. Therefore pre-service  teachers are immersed in an environment which targets the use of  and application of learning technologies in teaching and learning  practices within the classroom. The study-methodology that is  being used involves a quasi-experimental design, using a pre-  post-test method, for giving a measure to the effectiveness of the  3D immersive world using the technology acceptance model  (TAM). Beyond data collected using pre- and post-test survey  methods, we also collect the breadcrumbs which learners leave  as they go through the immersive environment using an  exploratory method of learning, whilst combining collaborative  practices with project-based learning. The data that is generated  from the learners pathways inside the virtual world is used to  understand not only the level of engagement of the learners with  the immersive environment but use it to predict the behavioral  intention to integrate learning technologies during their real  classroom practices. The assessment of learning inside the virtual  world is based upon structured activities that are carried out in- world, as well as interactions that occur during the in-world  residence. The real-time data that is collected over the virtual  world dashboard helps to identify the level of interactions  amongst avatars, the objects inside the world that the learner  avatars interact with most, and the activities that the learners do  inside the world.    3.2 Corporate training: immersion-on-the job  TELUS, a leading Canadian telecommunications service provider  has transformed its new employee training and on-boarding  programme with TELUS Collaboration House using AvayaLive  Engage. The program it is currently offering its new employees a  more cost-effective, efficient means to bring new employees into  the company and get them excited and productive early in the  employee lifecycle as part of its national growth strategy.  Therefore the 3D immersive space is basically being used to  relieve the cumbersome task of scheduling and significant  investments in time, travel and facilities. Since June 2011, more  than 1000 new TELUS employees have been trained and on- boarded through the Collaboration House. During the training  held in-world they go through set targets to get up and running  within the company. AvayaLive Engage gives enterprises the  possibility to set up training through formal, scheduled learning  events and sessions as well as informal meetings held amongst  company employees to facilitate accidental collaboration,  especially in contexts when employees may not have other  opportunities for meeting up. Collected data shows that  satisfaction rates amongst employees have soared.    4. RESULTS  The dashboard of the Avaya Live Engage platform gives us access  to information related to the visitor history, the duration of each  avatars residence, the conversation of the avatars and which part  of the virtual world, the resident avatars spend more time in. In  corporate training, important results that need to be displayed are  real time indicators of attendance, participation and engagement  and the reduction the corporate/training and education sectors  over-reliance on lag indicators in assessment. Analytics are also  used to assess the achievements of avatars, such as who interacts  most, who converts most opportunities, or who is the best  connector. The figures below show some examples of  preliminary data that is being collected throughout our  investigation.    232       Figure 1 - An overview of the dashboard from Avaya Live  Engage  Further to the overall dashboard additional data can be collected  using the volume usage relating to the users interaction with the  content inside the virtual world layout as well as the common user  paths that are traced as the in-world avatars traverse the virtual  world.      Figure 2 - Common User Paths tracing learner activities  inside the virtual world  The conversation history per authenticated avatar is also traced  giving an overview of the learners visits in relation to the  amounts of conversation minutes which they sustain inside the  world.      Figure 3 - A visualization of the data collected for the  conversation minutes versus the amounts of minutes that  participants spend in-world   5. IMPLICATIONS   Learning Analytics are increasingly showing that through the  collection and harvesting of big data we can understand more  about the learning pathways being taken by the learners and   through adaptive techniques we can modify our methods and  approaches to teaching in a way which would benefit the learners  most (Bienkowski, Feng, & Means, 2012). It has also been shown  that the visualization of data, by both learners and teachers can  indeed motivate learners to take actions in a way that they monitor  and moderate attention levels (Duval, 2011). The dashboard we  are using carries implications in corporate training that help  administrators and managers to understand the benefits and value  of the 3D immersive experience. The analytics help them estimate  the amount of money saved by hosting events and sessions  virtually rather than physically. In addition the analytics show the  flow of the learning experience, times of day when accessed,  length of time individuals stayed in the level, and whether the  trainees are active/passive. In higher education, we focus on  collecting data that can help us focus on user behavior modeling  and thus monitor the type of actions that can lead us to predict to  user engagement with the content that the virtual world presents  and with the virtual world connections that are established in- world. Some of the questions we are trying to focus on include:  which learning objects in-world are more effective for promoting  learning Does the use of an immersive space enable a greater  access to learning What modalities of learning can stimulate  learner engagement The data that we collect include learner  actions however we aim to use other data gathered from pre-and  post-test surveys, as well as from focus group sessions to be able  to combine the multiple sources of data and provide an integrated  picture of the learners chosen learning paths across the 3D  immersive space. We want to understand the level and depth of  engagement that learners inside the immersive environment reach  and whether this leads to behavior modeling and change that is  longer term. The limitations and challenges that we are currently  facing include the size of the population participating, and the  amounts of data that we are collecting which may be considered  to be small, albeit it being the entire cohort of pre-service  teachers, and the entire group employed on the workforce of the  company. We are also aware that although the data collected may  give indications about certain directions, the learners and the  teachers may themselves have different perceptions about the  learning that is occurring. Our future research lies in how learner  progress can be monitored in terms of his/her journey inside the  immersive space. Since inside the immersive spaces learning does  not follow a structured pathway, it is very difficult for the learners  to establish their position on a learning continuum. At this  moment in time, the dashboard that we are working with, can  deliver important information to course coordinators and  organisers however this information might not be considered  interpretable for the learners/course participants. Therefore our  future research lies in designing and implementing a model for  interpreting analytics by aligning a learning continuum with the  set world objectives. The information gathered from the data  collected in-world is then used to trace a learning path covered by  the learner. This path is also made available to the learner, so that  beyond the display of statistical data about where he/she visited  and how much he/she conversed, the data is translated into  attainment targets. These attainment targets may also equate to the  measurement of knowledge, competence and skills as part of the  overall behavioral changes that might lead us to predict the level  of engagement by the learners over a period of time.    6. CONCLUSION  In conclusion we have to say that the initial data that we are  collecting over the 3D virtual world is quite encouraging. The  data is showing that the majority of learners have already  established a working presence inside the 3D immersive space   233    that goes beyond our expectations. In corporate training the  response is also extremely satisfactory with reports of increased  employee collaboration that extend beyond the face-to-face  meetings. In the case of higher education pre-service teachers we  find that from the initial findings, there is an enthusiasm for this  modality for learning that is as yet rather unparalleled when  compared to courses taught by traditional face-to-face methods.  The data analytics also show that the participants are not  compartmentalizing their learning times into set day time, but they  log in at disparate times, have meetings late at night, and work  through weekends without any undue pushing from our end. We  believe that we are still at the initial stages for exploring further  research in the exploitation of learning analytics for immersive  spaces. The directions in which we want to take our research lie  not only in terms of prediction models, but also in the ways of  presenting meaningful information to our learners. At the focus of  our interest for both higher education and corporate training, are  the learners who design their own learning pathways inside a 3D  immersive world, using data in a way that can trace a meaningful  connection in a learning environment.    7.
