The Second International Workshop  on Teaching Analytics (IWTA) 2013 seeks to bring  together researchers and practitioners in the fields of  education, learning sciences, learning analytics, and visual  analytics to investigate the design, development, use,  evaluation, and impact of visual analytical methods and  tools for teachers dynamic diagnostic decision-making in  real-world settings.

Teaching Analytics is conceived as a subfield of learning  analytics that focuses on the design, development,  evaluation, and education of visual analytics methods and  tools for teachers in primary, secondary, and tertiary  educational settings.  Teachers professional practices with  visual analytics methods and tools are a central concern of  teaching analytics. Teaching analytics methods and tools  aim to develop innovative solutions to assist and augment  teachers dynamic diagnostic decision-making in the  classrooms of the 21st century [1-3]. An example usage  scenario (but not limited to) is the use of teaching analytics  methods and tools in high-performance classrooms that are  characterized by 1:1 computing, high cognitive density, and  big data.    Building on the NEXT-TELL project and the first  international workshop on teaching analytics (TAPTA- 2012) held at EC-TEL 2012 (http://www.next tell.eu/tapta/), the current workshop (IWTA-2013)  explores methods and tools to support teachers  professional vision in classrooms. This workshops  ambitious objective is to jumpstart a new learning analytics  research stream on teaching analytics by bringing together  learning scientists in different sub-fields such as CSCL,  ITS, EDM, researchers in Visual Analytics, and data  scientists working with Big Data in public institutions  and private enterprises. In addition to researchers, we are  also targeting teachers at primary, secondary, and tertiary  levels of education to be involved as co-designers and  discussants.   As mentioned earlier, the first workshop on teaching  analytics (TAPTA-2012, http://www.next tell.eu/tapta/), was held at EC-TEL 2012.

LAK '13, April 08 - 12 2013, Leuven, Belgium   Copyright 2013 ACM 978-1-4503-1785-6/13/04$15.00.   287    participants included researchers as well as teachers. Topics  presented and discussed at the first workshop included  semiology for teaching analytics, multi-domain perspective  on data collection and analysis, ontological engineering and  scripting applications, open learner models, browser-based  learning management system extensions, and investigation  tools for teacher training. Teachers from the Strmstad  Gymnasium, Sweden were invited to present their  observations and reflections on the pedagogical practices in  their 1:1 laptop school. Workshop proceedings are available  at http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-894/.   The key lessons learnt from the first workshop were the  need to further focus the workshop on teachers current  pedagogical and analytical practices, expand the scope to  include real-time teaching scenarios in the actual classroom,  and explicitly emphasize the use of visual analytics for  technology enhanced formative assessment. Based on the  above, we invite researchers and teachers to participate in  the IWTA-2013. Workshop submissions can be in the form  of position papers, tool demonstrations, conceptual  sketches, and/or thought experiments.    Please note workshop submissions should be concerned  with teachers use of visual analytics methods and tools in  some shape or form. No requirements are placed on  contexts such as high-performance classrooms or big data  volumes or real-time decision-making.    TOPICS  IWTA-2013 workshop topics include but are not limited to  the following:    Historical and contemporary practices in notations,  representations, and  visualizations of classroom  activities and student learning    Theories and methods for designing and evaluating  new notations, representations, and visualizations  for teaching analytics    Cognitive dimensions of notations for learning and  teaching purposes    Visual analytics for activity tracking   Visual analytics for knowledge tracking   Visual analytics for formative vs. summative   evaluations   Visual analytics for technology enhanced   formative assessment   Engendering  teachers professional vision in high-  performance classrooms   Synthesis of visual analytics oriented theory and   practice in the Learning Sciences, e-Learning,  Computer Supported Collaborative Learning  (CSCL), Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),  Educational Data Mining, and Learning Analytics.    Technical architectures and technological  infrastructure for teaching analytics    Linked Data for teaching analytics   Instrumentation of classrooms and ecosystems for   learning and teaching   Critical perspectives on teaching analytics   WORKSHOP FORMAT   According to Kensing and Madsen (1991, p. 157),    A Future Workshop is divided into three phases:  the Critique, the Fantasy, and the Implementation  phase. Essentially the Critique phase is designed to  draw out specific issues about current work  practice; the Fantasy phase allows participants the  freedom to imagine what if the workplace could  be different; and the Implementation phase focuses  on what resources would be needed to make  realistic changes. These phases are surrounded by  preparation and follow-up periods.   We plan to use 75 minutes to jump start the Critique and  Fantasy phases of the Future Workshop and then the  interactive sessions #1 and #2 will be used to structure the  workshop contributions on all three phases of the future  workshop.   9.00  09:15 Introductions   9.15  10:30 Future Workshop on Teaching Analytics  (Critique and Fantasy Phases)   10.30  11.00  Coffee break   10.30  12.00  Interactive Session #1    (Critique, Fantasy, and Implementation Phases)    Position papers, tool demonstrations, conceptual  sketches, or thought experiments.    12.00  13.00 Lunch break   13.00  14.30  Interactive Session #2    (Critique, Fantasy, and Implementation Phases)     Position papers, tool demonstrations,  conceptual sketches, or thought experiments.   14:30-15:00: Coffee break   15:00-16:00: Plenary Discussion Session   16:00-16:30: Conclusion and Next Steps   19:00-22:00: Workshop Group Dinner   SELECTION PROCESS  4-6 page position papers/1-2 page tool demonstration/1- page conceptual sketches/1-paragraph thought experiments  were sought through a Call for Papers that was widely  distributed.
