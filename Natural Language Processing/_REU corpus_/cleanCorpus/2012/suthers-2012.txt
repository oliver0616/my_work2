This workshop is primarily   designed for researchers interested in empirical-analytical   studies using data-intensive computational methods of analysis   (including social-network analysis, log-file analysis, data   mining, video analysis).

LEARNING AT MULTIPLE LEVELS  Technological and societal developments over the past few   decades have led to the emergence and confluence of multiple   conceptions of learning beyond what was possible at scale in a   pre-networked age. Studies of collaborative learning originating   in educational and cognitive psychology first conceived of   social settings as providing stimuli and conditions for   individual learning, but progressed towards more collective   forms of learning agency [5]. Led by the seminal work of   Roschelle and Teasley [19], a productive line of research and   practice focuses on understanding how small groups maintain a   joint conception of a problem, taking the group as the unit of   learning agency [16, 10]. At the community level, we find   concepts of learning as legitimate peripheral participation in   the practices of a community [12]; a process that also constructs   personal identity, entwining individual learning with group   practices that themselves can change; and knowledge   building: the deliberate effort of a community to increase its   cultural capital.   The growth of online learning and increasing percentages of   working or geographically distributed students enrolled in   educational institutions makes the understanding of formal and   informal learning in online settings more pressing [1].   Furthermore, Web 2.0 technologies and their associated   practices have increased the prominence of networked   individualism [2], leading to greater emphasis on networked   learning [3]. As Jones, Dirckinck-Holmfeld, & Lindstrom [8]   point out, this conception of learning emphasizes the power of   weak ties to enable individuals to access large networks of   resources [6], and thereby challenges the emphasis on strong   ties implied by both theories of collaborative learning in closely   interacting small groups [15] and the shared identity of   communities of practice [20].    Rather than viewing these and other conceptions of learning as   competing alternatives, we recognize that todays learners   participate in multiple forms of learning that take place   simultaneously at different scales and that influence each other   in constitutive and contextual relationships. Networked   learning succeeds when there is positive synergy between   individual activity and accrual of collective value that can be   drawn upon further by individuals [9]. Sociotechnical systems   intensify pathways of influence between local times and places   and support the emergence of global social phenomena from the   myriad of associations between many actors and artifacts [11].   The information and communication technologies (ICT)   underlying such systems enable us, as was never before   possible, to observe these processes through the electronic   traces left by participants [3, 18]. Multiple levels and forms of   learning phenomena are manifest in these traces in different   ways, leading researchers to combine different analytic   techniques. For example, Harrer and colleagues [7] and   Martinez and colleagues [13, 14] have combined quantitative   and qualitative content analysis with social network analysis;   De Laat, Lally, Lipponen & Simons [4] investigate patterns of   interaction using content analysis, critical event recall, and   social network analysis; and Suthers and colleagues [18, 17]   have developed an analytic hierarchy that transforms log files   into representations of action, interaction, associations, and ties   for multilevel analysis of online learning. The present   workshop is concerned with further developing the analytic   tools needed to address multiple levels of learning embedded in   networks.

OBJECTIVES OF THE WORKSHOP  The workshop continues a series of workshops on a   multivocality theme, in which multivocal dialogue takes   place between analysts who address multiple scales of groups   and learning communities at multiple granularities of analysis,   with multiple methods of analysis and theoretical foundations.    The workshop on Connecting Levels of Learning in Networked   Communities, held at the 9th International Conference on   Computer Supported Collaborative Learning in Hong Kong,   was convened to address the theoretical and methodological   challenges of studying multi-level learning phenomena. The   workshop organizers perceive a need to connect (bridge   between, coordinate, etc.) analyses of how learning takes place   locally via individual activity and in small group settings and   global learning phenomena such as the learning of a community   or how local activity produces resources for learning in other   locales. Concomitant with these questions of the relationships   between local and network level learning phenomena come   questions of how theories at these levels articulate with each   other or explain phenomena across levels, and how methods for   local analysis, such as microanalytic or process oriented   methods and content analysis can be coordinated with methods   for qualitative case comparisons and methods for global   analysis, such as social network analysis.    The present workshop stresses how integrating multiple   methods of analysis reaches to practical questions of integrating   computational tools. Especially the interaction between certain   analysis methods and techniques and certain models and   approaches to theory building is of high interest. Guiding   questions and themes include:     How to detect emergent phenomena and patterns in traces   of collective/collaborative learning activities by using a   plurality of methods How do we interconnect these   methods    What theoretical perspectives are relevant to bridging   levels and methods of analysis    What practical techniques such as different types of   triangulation or visualization can help to connect different   levels and approaches of analysis    What are the prospects of technical integration of analysis   tools through a kind of open analysis workbench (open   architecture, adequate GUI metaphors)    REFERENCES   [1] I.
