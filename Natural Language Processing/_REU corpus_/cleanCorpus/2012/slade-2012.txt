Learning Analytics and Higher Education:   Ethical Perspectives   Sharon Slade  Open University   Foxcombe Hall, Boars Hills  Oxford, UK   +44(0)1865 486250   s.slade@open.ac.uk      Fenella Galpin  Open University   Foxcombe Hall, Boars Hills  Oxford, UK   +44(0) 1865 486284   f.a.v.galpin@open.ac.uk      Take two students who were enrolled on the same higher  education course, both of whom were identified as likely to  benefit from additional support and tailoring of their learning  experience.  Three years later, one student has gone on to gain a  good degree and is now making great progress in her career.  The  other student, whose background and learning needs appeared  similar, scraped through the experience, has recently been eased  out of her organization and is unemployed.  To what extent were  decisions taken by their tutors and institution about the design of  their learning experiences, responsible for these two very different  outcomes     **********************   The vast potential of Learning Analytics in student support and  engagement cannot be denied  a different and appropriate  learning experience tailored for each student taking a module  sounds just what learning designers would wish for  but the  ethical issues and their impact on stakeholders needs to be  carefully thought through.   With increasing competition from the private sector and reduced  funding in the public sector, many higher education (HE)  institutions are giving much more attention to retention and  progression of students throughout their studies.  At the same time  HE institutions are making increasing use of online course  delivery as part of their standard offering.  Add to this the  explosion in electronic data which it is now possible to collect,  and the potential for Learning Analytics is clear.

General Terms  Management, Measurement, Performance, Design, Human  Factors   Keywords  Learning Analytics, Open University (OU), student walk,   Analytics have been used in the corporate sector for years, where   clear benefits can be seen.  A recent McKinsey report [1] proposes  that the potential for a retailer embracing  big data (the  enormous trails of data each of us generates during our daily  lives)  can lead to a 60% increase in its operating margin.   Amazon, for example, has been using customer data for some  time to tailor their offerings accordingly, and this is generally  welcomed, or at least accepted, by customers.     HE Institutions are similarly confident that Learning Analytics is  capable of facilitating clearer and simpler means of understanding  and driving student engagement and performance, and thus  enhancing retention and progression.  But in contrast to the use of  analytics in the corporate sector, Learning Analytics is potentially  a much more emotive topic, as it raises issues of success and  failure, personal prospects and labels that can stick for life.  In his  report on the first International Conference on Learning Analytics  and Knowledge (LAK11), held in Banff, Canada, in 2011, Brown  [2] reports that speakers and delegates were in agreement that  Learning Analytics raises deep and complex privacy issues akin  to eavesdropping: the ethical concerns are clear to see.     HE institutions have, of course, been analyzing data to some  extent for many years.  Public examinations at school level, for  example, are completely accepted as indicators of student  selection for courses and institutions.  Academic analytics,  however, in which progress is measured and the approach to  supporting the student is adapted as a programme progresses, is a  new phenomenon.     The assumption that its acceptable to collect and make use of  data on individuals or groups by monitoring patterns of behaviour  is increasingly coming under the spotlight.  Facebook, for  example, has recently been in the news for using photographs of  members without their permission to endorse the commercial  products of third parties to Friends .   Earlier on, we pointed out that it would be wonderful if learning  could be tailored for each individual student.  This is usually  impractical with large groups and limited teaching resource and so  grouping of data to create a limited range of semi-standardized  learning offerings has been the obvious simplification.  Van Wel  and Royakker [3] ask what rights the student has to remain an  individual.  They express concerns about de-individualisation,  where students are judged and treated according to group  characteristcs rather than their own specific capabilities and traits.   They show, too, that the use of group characteristics can lead to  non-distributed group profiles, where not every member of the  group necessarily shares every one of the characteristics of that  group.  Personalisation of service is seen as positive, but if its  achieved by creating non-distributed group profiles, then it can  lead to de-individualised discrimination.

But if they do know, and are being given a  less than positive label  albeit in the interest of student support  and concern  what long term effect might that have  If students  are given the opportunity to withhold information about  themselves, the data set becomes weaker and therefore has less  validity and use.     The potential upsides of data collection and analysis are manifold.   Harvard, for example, are experimenting with Classroom click  streams [4] to group students, based on Learning Analytics.   Rather than asking students to discuss an issue with whoever may  be sitting next to them in the classroom, a computer chooses who  they should talk to, based on their study profile to date.  At the  Open University, and as reported elsewhere in these Proceedings,   we have found that targeted support to students has led to tangible  improvements in retention and progression.     Will Learning Analytics fulfil its promise to make courses and  institutions more accessible and appropriate, or will students be  steered away from concepts and methods that might lower their  scores  When tutors have access to substantial but selective data  will it still be possible for them to deal with their students fairly  and objectively  Perhaps a disservice is being done to students if  they are constantly directed down the right course, and have the  right materials put in front of them.  Is the institution by so  doing hampering the students ability to learn how to learn in the  long run  How will they be prepared for the real world, if  everything has been pre selected for them  How will students  learn to make their own choices  And what chance is there for  serendipity  for happy accidents or pleasant surprises   Learning Analytics will never be a panacea.  If students are not  progressing satisfactorily there are many factors to be taken into  account.  But if it can be harnessed to best effect and taking due  account of ethical considerations, surely Learning Analytics can  be a powerful tool in enhancing the students experience and  increasing his or her chances of long term success     WORKSHOP OUTLINE   A wide range of issues and consequences relating to the use of  Learning Analytics will be explored from different stakeholder  perspectives in this practical half day workshop.  The workshop  will engage participants in an exploration of some of the ethical  complexities that are introduced by using Learning Analytics to  categorise and predict student cohorts and behaviours.   Scenarios  and data sets will be used to bring out the issues for different  stakeholder groups.  Work in small groups will surface ethical  issues around Learning Analytics and identify possible ways  forward to address the issues raised.  A plenary session will share  and record group outputs, which will then form the basis for  further online discussion and potential future research.   Issues covered may include:   Might the use of Learning Analytics present insurmountable  ethical challenges    How and why do ethical decisions get made   How to bring together potentially conflicting views from those  involved in the Learning Analytics process  tutors, students,  administrators/management.   Is Learning Analytics about standardization or personalized  tailoring   Does Learning Analytics drive the behaviour of a HE institution  and what role does the culture of the institution play in Learning  Analytics How far should the responsibilities of an institution go  to support identified cohorts   Why might tutors be in favour or not of support driven by a  Learning Analytics approach   How might Learning Analytics facilitate or suppress access to  additional student support   What are the effects on student behaviour of labeling student  groups   Who are the real beneficiaries of this approach  the student or the  institution   ABOUT THE FACILITATORS   Fenella Galpin and Sharon Slade are senior lecturers in the  Faculty of Business and Law at the Open University in the UK.  They work to support both tutors and students on Open University  distance learning modules and programmes. The Open  Universitys move toward curriculum-based support means they  are at the forefront of the practical and operational use of  Learning Analytics in the University. They have significant  experience and involvement in running staff development  workshops and other sessions for OU tutors, staff and students.   Their research interests encompass online delivery learning and  tutoring, online learning communities and Learning Analytics.   REFERENCES  [1] McKinsey Global Institute. 2011.
