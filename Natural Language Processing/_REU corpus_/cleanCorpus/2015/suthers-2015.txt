From Contingencies to Network-level Phenomena:  Multilevel Analysis of Activity and Actors in   Heterogeneous Networked Learning Environments  Dan Suthers   Dept. of ICS, University of Hawaii  1680 East West Road, POST 317   Honolulu, HI 96822  1.808.956.3890   suthers@hawaii.edu     ABSTRACT  Learning in social settings is a complex phenomenon that involves  multiple processes at individual and collective levels of agency.  Thus, a richer understanding of learning in socio-technical  networks will be furthered by analytic methods that can move  between and coordinate analyses of individual, small group and  network level phenomena. This paper outlines Traces, an analytic  framework designed to address these and other needs, and gives  examples of the frameworks practical utility using data from the  Tapped In educator professional network. The Traces framework  identifies observable contingencies between events and uses these  to build more abstract models of interaction and ties represented  as graphs. Applications are illustrated to identification of sessions  and key participants in the sessions, relations between sessions as  mediated by participants, and longer-term participant roles.

Introduction  As formal and informal education increasingly takes place in  online interaction spaces, tools are needed to help those who  manage such spaces identify and understand activity and key  actors. This paper outlines one possible approach for building  such tools, based on a framework for analysis of learning  interactions that has broader ambitions. The purpose of the paper  is twofold: to summarize the current version of this framework,  called Traces, and to illustrate its relevance to practitioners via an  envisioned activity reporter.    The framework is motivated by a view of learning as a complex  and multilevel phenomenon. Theories of how learning takes place   in social settings vary in the agent of learning (e.g., individual,  small group, network or community), and in the process of  learning [34] (e.g., information transfer or knowledge  communication [6], intersubjective meaning-making such as  argumentation and co-construction [2, 33], shifts in participation  and identity [17, 27], and accretion of cultural capital [30]). We1  claim that learning takes place simultaneously at all of these levels  of agency and with all of these processes, potentially at multiple  time scales [18]. Thus, understanding learning in its full richness  requires data that reveal the relationships between individual and  collective levels of agency and potentially coordinating multiple  theories and methods of analysis [8, 21, 39]. A multi-level  approach is also motivated by our theoretical stance that social  regularities arise from how myriad individual acts are aggregated  and influence each other, possibly mediated by artifacts [16, 15],  and the methodological implication that to understand phenomena  such as actor relationships or community structures, we need to  also look at the stream of individual acts out of which these  phenomena are constructed.    The Traces analytic framework (described shortly) was designed  to meaningfully connect multiple levels of analysis. Matching  their complementary strengths and weaknesses, we combine  interaction analysis, which enables us to see what groups of  individuals are doing and how they are doing it (but at a level of  detail that obscures larger scale patterns), with social network  analysis, which provides summaries of ties and affiliations in a  form amenable to drawing conclusions about network or  community patterns (but loses the details of how people actually  interact). We also work with intermediate levels of analysis  between these extremes.    The practical relevance of our approach to learning analytics  derives from phenomena such as the emergence of Web 2.0 [23]  and its adoption by the educational communities, including more  recent interest in MOOCS (Massive Open Online Courses) [1]. In  these environments, learning is distributed across time and virtual  place (media), and learners may participate in multiple settings.  We focus on networked learning environments (NLE)2, which we  define to include any socio-technical network that involves                                                                        1 Although this paper is single-author, it is based on an ongoing   line of work reaching back over many years: see  acknowledgments for colleagues.

Our work will not be as applicable to isolated activity by  individuals, no matter how many, such as xMOOCS in which  large numbers of individuals interact primarily with courseware.  We are developing our framework using a data corpus from  Tapped In, an online network of education professionals,  including but not limited to preservice and inservice teachers. This  NLE displayed many of the characteristics of current  heterogeneous distributed environments. It offered asynchronous  threaded discussions, quasi-synchronous chat, file sharing, and  other media for interaction. Participants included members of  organizations and others in scheduled events and persons who  came to Tapped In of their own accord; and all participants were  free to wander between specific settings and events.  Consequently, the activity of a given participant resulted in  different kinds of traces in the log files associated with these  media, at different times and different virtual spaces. The trace of  what for a given participant was a unitary experience is  fragmented across these logs. The need to reassemble fragmented  traces into a single analytic artifact was another motivation for  developing Traces.    To preview the Traces approach, logs of events are abstracted and  merged into a single abstract transcript of events, and this is used  to derive a series of representations that support levels of analysis  of interaction and of ties. Three kinds of graphs model interaction:  Contingency graphs record how events such as chatting or posting  a message are observably related to prior events by temporal and  spatial proximity and by content.  Uptake graphs aggregate the  multiple contingencies between each pair of events to model how  each given act may be taking up prior acts.  Session graphs are  abstractions of uptake graphs: they cluster events into spatio- temporal sessions with uptake relationships between sessions.  Relationships between actors and artifacts are abstracted from  interaction graphs to obtain associograms [38, 40], which can be  folded into traditional sociograms.   Other publications have detailed some of the theory [15, 34] and  analytic representations [37, 40] behind this work. This paper  reports on how these ideas have been implemented to transform  events into interaction and session graphs and sociograms, and in  particular will focus on the utility of the derived sociograms and  how they retain information from the interaction analysis.   2. Tapped In  In developing and testing our framework, we use a data corpus  from SRI Internationals Tapped In (tappedin.org), an  international online network of educators engaged in diverse  forms of informal and formal professional development and peer  support [10, 31]. Tapped In was motivated by the desire to  understand how to initiate and manage large heterogeneous  communities of educators, how such communities evolve, and the  benefits that participants derive from their involvement (Mark  Schlager, personal communication). This network included  activities that were sponsored by formal organizations (e.g.,  universities, school districts, and nonprofits) mixed with volunteer  driven and other unsponsored activities, in both synchronous and  asynchronous media, with participants from across all career  stages and diverse occupations related to education. Thus, Tapped  In provides an opportunity to develop and test hypotheses, tools,  and techniques for understanding heterogeneous networks.  Cumulatively, Tapped In hosted the content and activities of more   than 150,000 education professionals (over 20,000 per year in our  study period) in thousands of user-created spaces that contain  threaded discussions, shared files and URLs, text chats, an event  calendar, and other tools to support collaborative work. Over its  16-year history, more than 50 organizations, including education  agencies and institutions of higher education became tenants in  the system with online courses, workshops, seminars, mentoring  programs, and other collaborative activities. There were also  approximately 40-60 public activities per month designed by  Tapped In members and open to anyone in the community.  Volunteers drove the majority of Tapped In community-wide  activity [10]. Extensive data collection capabilities captured the  activity of all members and groups, including chat data,  discussion board interactions, and file sharing. The trend in  current social media is for such data to be treated as a proprietary  asset, and some are even discouraging big data research outside of  industry (as reported by [5]), a dangerous trend. The Tapped In  data corpus offers a valuable opportunity for study of how large  heterogeneous socio-technical networks evolve.    We selected a period from September 2005 through May 2007 for  our research, and used smaller samples within this period to  develop and test our methods. This period was chosen because  graphs of activity showed peak usage during this time, and we  wanted to study a successful network.3 (Usage tapered off after  2010, and Tapped In was shut down in 2013.) In the remainder of  this paper, we illustrate the analytic capabilities of the Traces  framework with several granularities of analysis centered around  one day of data in April 2006. This day includes a Teaching  Teachers session on mentoring that we had previously selected  for micro-analysis due to its engaged and thoughtful discussion,  and other related sessions. (A sample of this session that will be  used for examples is shown later in Table 1.) By analyzing data  from the days and weeks surrounding this session, we can assess  how the methods described in this paper identify this session and  its actors, and how it was embedded in its surrounding context.    3. Traces Analytic Framework  This section briefly summarizes the framework, updating previous  descriptions [36, 40] to reflect the current state of design and  implementation. The representations used at various levels of  analysis are shown schematically in Figure 1 (next page):  micro- relations between situated acts by participants are identified and  then aggregated into interactional relations, and further aggregated  into network level phenomena.   At the bottom, we exemplify various traces of activity (such as log  files of events) that provide the source data. (Our actual data  includes database logs and textual transcripts of chats.) These are  parsed using methods that are necessarily system-specific into an  event stream, shown in the second level (boxes in Figure 1b). The  event representation includes their time, location, event type,  actor, and content or media object where relevant.    3.1 Contingency Graph  At this level of abstraction (Figure 1b), we compute contingencies  between events, to produce a model of how acts are mutually  contextualized (shown as arrows). Human action is contingent  upon its setting in diverse ways: our computational methods                                                                        3 After years of study of this corpus I am impressed with how   successful it was. The interaction was rich and diverse, a credit  to Mark Schlagers design vision and what he, Judi Fusco and  Patti Schank accomplished in carrying out this vision.    369    capture some of these contingencies that are amenable to  automated detection. A contingency called proximal event (PE)  reflects the likelihood that events occurring close together in time  and space are related. In analyzing quasi-synchronous chat,  contingencies are installed to prior contributions in the same room  that occur within an adjustable time window but not too recently.  A Keystroke Level Model [25] of how long a typist would have  taken to type the contribution is used to ensure that the prior  contribution was already visible when typing began by closing the  window this amount of time before the contribution (see [36] for  details). For example, referring to Table 1 (next page), APs  contribution at 23:42 is PE contingent on MTs question at 23:35,  but APs contribution at 23:38 is not, having occurred too soon  after. Address (ADR) and reply (RPL) contingencies are installed  between an utterance mentioning a user by name and the last  contribution (ADR) and next contribution (RPL) by that  participant within a time window, using a parser/matcher of user  IDs to first names. For example, an Address Contingency is  placed between DAs 24:27 That is an interesting question M  and MTs prior question at 23:35; while a Reply Contingency is  placed between MTs  thought about often D at 24:42 and  Ds 24:27. Same actor contingencies (SA) are installed to prior  acts of a participant over a larger time window to reflect the  continuity of an agents purpose. All of MTs later contributions  are contingent on the earlier ones by Same Actor in this short  excerpt. Overlap in content as represented by sets of lexical stems  is used to produce a lexical contingency (LEX) weighted by the  number of overlapping stems. For example, the lexical stems for   APs contribution at 23:38 and for ASs contribution at 24:09  overlap on peopl, using the NLTK Lancaster Stemmer, [24].  We do not claim that this specific set of contingencies is sufficient  for analysis, and others are under development, though we are  finding them to be a good starting point to explore the potential of  our framework. Our research and development strategy is to see  how far we can get with these simpler contingencies before  adding computational complexity.    The resulting contingency graph (e.g., Figure 1b) is represented  as the first layer of abstraction in what we call an Entity-Event- Contingency graph or EEC [37]. In the EEC graph, vertices are  Events. These can be of various types (e.g., enter chat, exit chat,  chat contribution), and are annotated with time stamps, actors,  content (e.g., chat content), and locations (e.g., chat rooms)  involved in the event. Contingencies are typed edges between  vertices (the types were described in the previous paragraph), and  there may be multiple edges between any two vertices (e.g., two  proximal events by the same actor with lexical overlap will have  at least three contingencies between them).   3.2 Uptake Graph  It is necessary to collapse the multiple edges between vertices into  single edges for two reasons. First, most graph algorithms assume  that there is at most only one edge between two vertices. Second,  we are interested in uptake, the relationship between events in  which a human action takes up some aspects of prior events as  being significant in some manner [37]. Replying to prior  contributions in chats and discussions are examples of uptake, but     Figure 1. Levels of Analysis and their Representations      370    uptake is not limited to replies: one can appropriate a prior actors  contribution in other ways. Uptake is not specific to a medium: it  can occur in different media, and cross media [37]. Contingencies  are of interest only as collective evidence for uptake, so we  abstract the contingency graph to an uptake graph.    As shown in Figure 1c, uptake graphs are similar to contingency  graphs in that they also relate events, but they collect together  bundles of the various types of contingencies between a given pair  of vertices into a single graph edge, weighted by a combination of  the strength of evidence in the contingencies and optionally  filtering out low-weighted bundles. Different weights can be used  for different purposes (e.g., finding sessions; analyzing the  interactional structure of sessions, constructing sociograms).  Importantly, we do not throw away the contingency weights: these  are retained in a vector to summarize the nature of the uptake  relation (and, once aggregated into sociograms, of the tie between  actors, to be discussed shortly).   An example weighting that has been used for uptake graphs is SA  2, LEX 1, ADR 3, RPL 3, PE 3. The lexical weight (LEX) is  multiplied by the number of lexical stems in common between the  two contributions, and proximal event (PE) decays according to  temporal distance between events within a time window of 120  seconds (e.g., it could be 3, 2 or 1). A permissive threshold of 1  allows creation of an arc in the uptake graph if there is just one  lexical overlap or to any event in the prior 120 seconds; a  threshold of 2 would require at least one other contingency for  older contributions before the possibility of uptake is asserted.    For example, consider DAs contribution at 24:27 and MTs  contribution at 24:42 (Table 1). The second event is contingent on  the first by lexical overlap (I), address, reply, and proximal  event (in the same room and 15 seconds apart). Applying the  uptake graph weighting, we get an uptake relation of weight 10,  annotated with a vector of weighted constituent contingencies that  we can write as: <SA 0, LEX 1, ADR 3, RPL 3, PE 3>.    3.3 Sessions  Clusters of events in spatio-temporal proximity are computed to  identify  sessions (indicated by rounded containers in Figure  1c). We can do several interesting things with uptake graphs.    For inter-session analysis, we collapse each session into a single  vertex representing the session, but retain the inter-session uptake  links. (For example, there are four sessions in Figure 1c and two  inter-session uptakes.) These inter-session links indicate potential  influences across time and space from one session to another. An  example will be given shortly in conjunction with Figure 2.    For intra-session analysis, the uptake graph for a session is  isolated. Several paths are possible from here. For example, the  sequential structure of the interaction can be micro-analyzed to  understand the development of group accomplishments: this part  is not automated. Methods for graph structure analysis can be  applied, such as cluster detection, analysis of graph motifs [20]  that represent uptake patterns of interest, or tracing out thematic  threads [41].   3.4 Sociograms  Either within or across sessions, we can fold uptake graphs into  actor-actor sociograms (directed weighted graphs, Figure 1d).   The tie strength between actors is the sum of the strength of  uptake between their contributions. These sociograms can be  analyzed using conventional social network analysis methods  such as degree or eigenvector centrality to identify key actors, etc.  [22, 42]. With sociograms we want to be stricter about the   evidence for relations between the two actors, so we use a  different weighting that downplays proximity and emphasizes  direct evidence of orientation to the prior actor. In the examples of  this paper we use SA 0 (no self-loops), LEX 3, ADR 5, RPL 5, PE  1. The threshold is set at 4, meaning the sum of weights must be at  least 4 to count towards a tie between actors in the sociogram.  (We are not claiming that these weights are optimal.)    Continuing our example, the weighing of uptake of DAs  contribution at 24:27 by MTs contribution at 24:42 becomes <SA  0, LEX 3, ADR 5, RPL 5, PE 1>. To illustrate how weights from  multiple uptakes are aggregated into a tie we need one more  uptake relation. MTs contribution at 25:18 is contingent on the  same contribution by DA (24:27) by <SA 0, LEX 0, ADR 0, RPL  5, PE 1>. If we folded only these two uptake relations by actor,  wed get a directed actor-actor tie from MT to DA weighted by a  vector of <SA 0, LEX 3, ADR 5, RPL 10, PE 2>, for a total of 20.  Of course, there are many other pairs of events that evidence  uptake of DA by MT, so the sums in any nontrival sociogram will  be larger.    3.5 Summary and Implementation  In summary, our framework provides multiple pathways for  analysis. Contingencies are applied to events in the EEC abstract  transcript to produce a contingency graph. Contingencies are then  aggregated into uptake between the same events. A single  aggregation can be used, or optionally different weightings can be  used for identifying sessions, doing detailed interaction analysis,  or constructing sociograms. In either case, uptake that crosses  partitions can be used to identify influences across space and time,  and uptake within partitions can be analyzed to study the  interactional structure of a session. Uptake graphs can be folded                                                                        4 By the Tapped In user agreement, transcripts of sessions such as   this one were public, and many were posted on a public web site  with full user login names. However, to conform to my own  institutions requirement, initials are used in this paper. The  exception will be two participants whose volunteer activities  (among that of other participants) were extremely important to  Tapped In, and who want to be identified: BjB and JeffC.

The present paper will illustrate  applications of session identification and analysis of sociograms.   Another line of analysis not discussed in this paper is to fold  events into actor-artifact networks, or bipartite weighted directed  graphs that we call associograms for short, because they capture  how actors are associated with each other via mutual read and  write of media objects. In that line of work, we have undertaken  community analysis of associograms to detect not only human  participants in communities, but also the artifacts that reflect their  mediated nature (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous) [38].    The framework is presently implemented in Java, using the  Hibernate object/relational model and persistence engine  (hibernate.org/orm), with callouts to the NLTK library (nltk.org)  and iGraph (igraph.sourceforge.net). Visualizations and  sociometrics for this paper were computed in Gephi (gephi.org).  See [36] for further discussion of the implementation.     4. Examples: Periodic Activity/Actor Reports  Facilitators (e.g., educators and learning network managers) may  find it useful, for varying reasons, to know where activity has  taken place in their NLE and the roles of participating actors.  There may be multiple virtual settings for participation (e.g., chat  rooms and discussion forums), and many potential participants.  As in our Tapped In environment, interaction events may be  scheduled formally or informally or occur spontaneously. A  facilitator might like to know: When and in what settings did  substantive interaction take place Who were the central actors  (including educators and students), and who appears disengaged  How were sessions related to each other, e.g., by central actors It  would be useful to have answers to these questions on a regular  recurring basis for timely intervention, e.g., daily or weekly, and  also over longer spans for research purposes.    This section provides examples of how our framework can  provide information relevant to these questions. We first briefly  show how sessions are detected, and then show analyses at  various granularities of analysis to illustrate the utility of the  Traces framework. At the granularity of a single session, we  identify main actors, those who may be disengaged, and   coherence of uptake. At granularity of one day, we visualize the  relations between sessions, and identify persons who are social  bridges mediating these relationships. At the granularity of one  week (where we can begin to discern enduring behaviors), we  characterize mediated relationships between actors. At the  granularity of multiple weeks, we plot the role development of  actors according to centrality metrics. These analyses are  presented in a different order than just listed, to follow a plausible  scenario of investigation. We begin with example reports for one  days activity (April 6, 2006), chosen because it includes some  interesting sessions we have studied, enabling us to validate the  results.    4.1 What happened today   Different options exist for detection of sessions in interaction  graphs. If interaction is not clearly demarcated by periods of non- interaction and one wishes to discover clusters of high activity, we  have found that cohesive subgraph detection or community  detection algorithms [11] such as modularity partitioning [4]  applied to uptake graphs are useful [36]. However, in the present  corpus, although there is ongoing activity everywhere, activity is   distributed across rooms, and the activity within a room almost  always has periods of non-activity between sessions. For present  purposes of analysis, identifying weakly connected components  on the proximal event contingency is sufficient to identify  sessions. This can be done efficiently without needing to construct  a contingency graph (it will be constructed later for other  purposes). Activity is tracked in each room, and a new session ID  is assigned to the room every time there is a gap of S seconds of  no activity. S is a tunable parameter: here we use 240 seconds.     4.1.1 What sessions of activity took place   Table 2 shows sessions comprising at least 100 events, including  chat entry/exit, chat messages, and emotes. (There were many  more small sessions. One could just as easily select by number of  participants.) We see that there is some activity in the morning  before school, and it resumes after school through the evening.   Several sessions run in parallel, and some rooms are reused.   4.1.2 How are the sessions related  Beyond size, we might be interested in how sessions relate to each  other. Figure 2 visualizes a portion of the inter-session uptake  graph for the day, including several of the largest sessions from  Table 1. Uptake relations between events in different sessions  have been aggregated into weighted uptake relations between  sessions. We see that some sessions have more heavily weighted  links between them. Reading the edges in reverse order (uptake  points backwards in time), we see that session 737 in  TI_Reception influenced 755 in Teachteach_Grp, which in turn  influenced 848 NTraining_Group. These are the three largest  sessions in Table 1. Sessions 908 (also in TI_Reception) and 828  (not in Table 1, but having the second highest number of  participants) were also related to 848. A facilitator of Tapped In  would know that TI_Reception often shows up in this manner, as  it the entry point for persons who just logged in. Clearly many  participants then went to 755 Teachteach_Grp, as indicated by the  thick 755737 link. But why is 755 so influential on 848, which  took place immediately after in NTraining_Grp A closer look at  these sessions will answer this and other questions.    Table 2.

It is also  important to know who is disengaged.    Some of these needs can be met through social network analysis.  As summarized in section 3, we can generate sociograms for any  granularity of the uptake graph (e.g., within a session, or across  sessions over a time period) by folding uptake relations between  events into ties between their actors. For example, a facilitator  might want to see a sociogram summarizing actor activity in  session 755, the Teachteach_Grp. The sociogram is shown in  Figure 3. Node size is weighted in-degree, discussed below.      4.2.1 Sociometrics  Sociograms add information over mere counts of number of  contributions (Contr in Table 3), because some sociometrics are  sensitive to the network context of nodes representing actors. For  example, weighted in-degree (WInDeg) indicates the extent to  which other acts have contingencies to and hence potentially took  up a given act: aggregating these for an actor is an estimate of  how much an actors contributions are taken up by others. This  metric is sensitive to both the level of activity of the actor and that  activitys relation to others activity. Weighted out-degree  (WOutDeg) is an estimate of how much an actor takes up others  contributions. Eigenvector centrality (Eigen) is a nonlocal metric  that takes into account the centrality of ones neighbors [22, p.  169], indicating the extent to which an actor is connected to others  who are themselves central. Betweeness centrality is an indicator  of actors who potentially play brokerage roles in the network:  high betweeness centrality means that that node representing an  actor is on relatively more shortest paths between other actors [22,  p. 185], so potentially controls information flow or mediates  contact between these actors. Betweeness will be of particular  interest when examining activity across sessions: different  sessions generally have different actors, so an actor attending  multiple sessions will have high betweeness.    4.2.2 Central actors in sessions  To continue our example, metrics for session 755  (Teachteach_Grp) are shown in Table 3. Our interest here is not  the specific actors of this historical Tapped In session, but rather  in what the analysis shows about this familiar data that it could  also show about novel data from current online interactions. We   can see that MT is the most central actor in this session by all  metrics. She has the most contributions (Contr); they are taken up  the most by others (WinDeg); and she takes up others  contributions the most (WOutDeg). As the leader, she mediates  between other actors in the session (Between). Eigenvector  centrality (Eigen) shows that other actors who are not as highly  ranked by Contr are central via their association with MT and  each other (see edge thickness in Figure 3). The sociometrics rank  actors distinctly from counts of contributions, for example, AP  has as many contributions as MT but is not as central on other  metrics. Actors WS, BJB, BJB2, and KLC have notably low  activity, and there are 6 actors not connected to any others (shown  only in Figure 3) because they did not make any contributions.  These are potentially disengaged participants, but one should  check their activity in other sessions before drawing this  conclusion. Actors BjB and BjB2 are the same person: she was  one of the most active volunteers, and often helped other  facilitators run their sessions, so she was given two accounts.  BjBs 3 contributions are all broadcast announcements of events  starting in various rooms.    A similar table for session 848 NTraining_Grp (omitted for space)  shows that MT is again the most central actor by all four metrics  shown. Examination of the transcripts for the two sessions show      Figure 2. Closeup of session graph with inter-session  uptake. Node and edge size is weighted degree.         Figure 3.

The sociometric table (and the sociogram)  for 848 shows that LH and AP are also present there: the chat  transcript shows that they followed MT to her next session and  asked permission to observe the class. This overlap in actors is the  primary basis for the weight on the combined 848755 uptake  relation, shown as line thickness in Figure 2. One apparent lurker  from 755, BJB2, is also in 848 with low levels of activity: we find  out more about her below.    4.2.3 Central actors across sessions  Some actor roles may not be apparent from a single session or  even day. Facilitators may be interested in those who are active  consistently over time. Betweeness is of particular interest here,  because sessions usually have little overlap in participants, but  some persons play key roles in Tapped In by participating in  multiple sessions, thereby potentially facilitating flow of  information and contacts across sessions. Aggregating into one  sociogram for the week from Sunday to Saturday that contains  April 6, 2006, we obtain the metrics in Table 4. We were familiar  with JeffC as the volunteer greeting participants in TI_Reception  (session 737) and MT as the facilitator of 755 and 848, but this  table draws attention to other actors. DW merits investigation as  the most active person this week. Although BjB was lurking in  the two sessions we examined, it turns out she facilitated sessions  of her own this week (including 845 ArtSites_Grp in Table 1, at  the same time as she observed 848 as BJB2). Three of the actors  are notable for their high betweeness: DW, BjB and JeffC,  meaning that they are potential brokers between the groups found  in various sessions.  Traces has detected an important role: these  three actors were volunteer facilitators who staffed TI_Reception  and helped others in their sessions (as well as their own).    Superficially, these analyses appear methodologically similar to  the many sociometric analyses found in the literature, so we  should highlight what the Traces framework has added. The  Traces framework derived these latent ties from automated  interaction analysis of streams of events, by identifying and then  aggregating multiple contingencies between events, and then  folding the resulting uptake relations between events into an  actor-actor graph. This has significant advantages over (for  example) manual content analysis or the use of surveys to derive  tie data, which are labor intensive, or reliance on explicit  friending relations: both surveys and friend links may not  reflect the ties that are latent in actual interaction between the  persons in question. Another advantage is described below.    4.3 How are actors related to each other   To recapitulate, the above analysis derived ties between actors by  aggregating multiple contingencies between their contributions.  The contingencies indicate the qualitative nature of the  relationship between these contributions, e.g., being close in time  and space, using the same words, and addressing another actor by  name. When contingencies are aggregated into uptake relations,  we keep track of what each type of contingency contributed to the  uptake relation. This record keeping is continued when folding  uptakes into ties, so that for any given pair of actors we have a  vector of weights that provides information about the nature of the  relationship in terms of the underlying contingencies.  For example, consider actors MT and DA, whom we saw  conversing in Table 1. The vectors underlying their tie for the full  week of April 2-8, 2006 are shown below. Contingency weights   have been divided by weights so that the following may be read as  counts of actual events. PE can be read as the denominator for  ADR and RPL. WS is the weighted sum based on the unadjusted  weighting scheme:    From To SA LEX ADR RPL PE WS  DA MT 0 29 16 4 34 350  MT DA 0 24 9 8 28 305   We can see that they frequently call each other by name. Sorting  all ties by weighted tie strength (WS), we find that the two closest  actors for this week were SLC and HB:    From To SA LEX ADR RPL PE WS  SLC HB 0.0 389 58 52 444 2161  HB SLC 0.0 359 40 69 414 2036   Relational information might be of interest to educators or  researchers who are managing collaborative learning activities  amongst students, or even to examine ones own relations to  students. Traces makes this possible by retaining information  about the interactional origins of ties.    4.4 How coherent are the sessions    Automating sequential analysis of uptake graphs requires further  work to bring the strength of uptake relations into closer  agreement with human interpretation. Ongoing work is addressing  this problem with further contingencies and experimenting with  weighting. However, we have found that folding our uptake  graphs to sociograms smooths out the noise and provides  sensible results [35]. Also, the uptake graphs we are presently  producing can expose some the structure of sessions through  graph clustering analysis. Specifically (and as discussed further in  [36]), applying a modularity partitioning or community  detection algorithm to the uptake graph for an entire day, we can  see whether modularity partitioning treats each session as a single  coherent graph cluster. Modularity partitioning tries to maximize  the links within a cluster as compared to what is expected at  random [22, p. 224]. Thus, if a session corresponds to a  modularity partition it has high internal linkage by our estimated  uptake relations, and lower linkage to other sessions. On the other  hand, if a session as defined by spatio-temporal proximity of  events was not coherent interactionally, then there would be more  than one modularity partition of the uptake graph for the session.  Here, coherence simply means continuity of uptake: it is not a  value judgment on the quality of interaction, as there may have  been several distinct yet high quality conversations in a space- time region.

Figure 4  shows (a) the full uptake graph colored by modularity class,  followed by excerpts for three sessions: (b) 755 Teachteach, (c)  848 Ntraining, and (d) 908 TI_Reception. As can be seen, the  topic-oriented sessions 755 and 848 are classified as mostly in one  modularity class. The second modularity class visible in both  cases is when participants were saying goodbye. On the other  hand, session 908 in TI_Reception has two large modularity  classes visible. This room is where most Tapped In users (those  who have not set their entry point to be their offices) will first  appear when they log in. Volunteers here direct newcomers to the  room holding the session they may be interested in. Various  spontaneous conversations also arise. Thus it is not surprising that  a session in TI_Reception has multiple modularity partitions. In  this session, there was an initial conversation, and then the  participants present changed around the time another session  ended at the breakpoint shown by the modularity partitioning.   All of the other sessions in Table 2 except two consisted primarily  of one modularity partition. The two exceptions were both where  chat was interrupted by other activity: in one case, an instructor  asks the students to do some work; in the other, the participants  briefly go into a Skype session. It should be noted that modularity  partitioning is sensitive to the graph over which it works. If one  gives any one of these sessions only the uptake graph for that  session, the algorithm will find more partitions. Ongoing work is  examining community detection on interaction graphs as a way of  analyzing sessions.    4.5 How does participation change over time  Analyses on longer time scales may be of interest to researchers  as well as practicing educators. Here we exemplify tracing the  development of actors roles over time in terms of changes in their  sociometrics. Using the same process as described above,  sociograms were automatically generated from over 700,000 chat  events for actors at one-week intervals over a 14-week period.  Weighted in-degree, betweeness and eigenvector centralities were  charted; due to space constraints we only show the latter in Figure  5. To illustrate different actor trajectories, we show two top actors  from Table 4 and three other actors of varying levels of  participation previously discussed.      Here, eigenvector centrality indicates the extent to which ones  contributions are taken up, weighted by the centrality of those  doing the uptaking. DW and JC are consistently highly central,  reflecting their high level of activity. MT, the facilitator of the  April 6 sessions, has varying levels of participation, sometimes as  high as the top facilitators. Her primary sessions run once a  month, as indicated by spikes every 4th week. A typical participant  is DA, who periodically comes in for moderate levels of activity,  but her eigenvector centrality is elevated in comparison to her  activity due to interacting with central actors such as MT (notice  that she has two spikes on the same weeks as MT). Finally, AP  only appeared on one day in this range of data, but achieved  noticeable centrality due to her high interaction with MT (Figure  3). The point is to illustrate that the Traces framework can  automatically generate sociometric and other data on participation  from large event logs to trace participant roles over time.    5. Contributions and Related Work   This paper introduced the Traces analytic framework, which  integrates traces of activity that are distributed across media,  places and time into an abstract transcript, and then provides a  linked abstraction hierarchy that uses observable contingencies  between events to build models of interaction and ties. It  addresses the need to understand aggregate phenomenon (e.g.,  ties, roles, and communities) as both produced by and  providing the setting of specific interactional events. The  framework has been implemented in software that enables us to  automatically analyze sequences of hundreds to millions of user  acts to derive models of interaction and social ties. This software  was developed using as a test case a rich historical data corpus  where diverse participants interacted in an environment that  exhibits many features of todays distributed interaction. The  paper illustrated the potential functionality of Traces through  examples of analyses that a facilitator of a networked learning  environment may want to undertake, including identification of  sessions and key participants in the sessions, relations between  sessions as mediated by participants, and participant roles as they  developed over time.

Modularity partitioning of uptake graph   Nodes are chat contributions. Layout is by OpenOrd in Gephi. Colors are  modularity partitions by Blondels algorithm.      375    Other authors have noted the need to combine multiple forms of  analysis, including specifically social network analysis in  networked learning environments. For example, de Laat and  colleagues [9] and Martnez and colleagues [19] showed the  utility of combining social network analysis with various  qualitative and quantitative methods in the study of participation  networks. Others have constructed and folded interaction graphs  into sociograms of ties between actors. For example, Rosen &  Corbit [29] constructed graphs based on temporal proximity, and  Haythornthwaite and Gruzd [13] describe preliminary work in  extracting interaction relations from references and names. The  Traces project is in the same spirit, but is arguably more mature.  We consider multiple kinds of relations between events to provide  a richer basis for session identification and subsequent analysis of  activity and actors within sessions, and have automated these  analyses. Work by Trausan-Matu on polyphonic analysis [41]  has affinities to our use of multiple contingencies, but has only  recently been abstracted to higher levels of analysis. A thesis by  Charles [7] has provided an alternative implementation of our  approach and extended the set of contingencies. This and other  work by Ulrich Hoppe and colleagues is closest to ours in  computational aspirations, e.g., their work on detecting  collaboration patterns [12]. Our approach dovetails with work that  applies natural language processing methods for analysis of  interactional structure [28], and indeed rules for generating  additional contingencies could be derived from such research.    6. Future Work   The present implementation is research software, written to  explore the range of analytic functionality enabled by the Traces  framework. Hence it is flexible and reconfigurable, but the level  of power and flexibility is overkill for some applications, and  reconfiguration is accomplished through a technical interface of  XML scripts and exported graph files rather than an end user GUI.  Practical implementations for specific analytic applications could  be optimized (made faster and simpler), at the cost of flexibility,  and interfaces more suitable for educators and NLE managers  would of course be needed.    The framework could be re-implemented to use current  technologies and APIs. For example, the data import layer could  utilize the TinCan API (tincanapi.com), which would make our  framework applicable to a variety of platforms adhering to this  standard and make it easier to write importers for other platforms  in a less ad-hoc manner. We might replace our custom Hibernate  graph persistence engine with Neo4j (neo4j.com), which has  matured since we started this project. An analytic workbench such  as [14] would increase usability for researchers.   Our ongoing research includes implementation and testing other  promising contingencies (e.g., n-gram echoing), and tuning  weights on contingencies for capturing the interactional structure  of sessions. Once these are well grounded, we can study how  patterns of uptake and metrics on the derived sociograms relate to  session quality, and use these to automatically identify sessions of  interest. Two other objectives include using inter-session  relationships to trace the spread of ideas, and incorporating  analysis of asynchronous discussions for analysis of cross-media  influences. Automating the generation of interaction and social  network graphs opens up further approaches for relating fine- grained interaction to more aggregated levels of analysis. For  example, multiple sociograms can be generated over time to track  significant changes to the group structure or individual role  emergence, or over larger time scales to identify critical points in  the formation of healthy or unhealthy communities. These   analytic options are enabled by our frameworks abstraction away  from media-specific concepts and representations, and the  automation of mapping between levels of analysis that this  abstraction enables.   7.
