Extending this research, this study examines whether   sequences of socially regulated learning differ across low,   medium or high performing groups. Scaffolded by a computer   avatar, 54 primary school students (working in 18 groups of 3)   discussed writing a report about a foreign country for 51,338   turns. Statistical discourse analysis (SDA) of these sequences of   talk showed that in high performing groups, high cognition was   preceded more often by high cognition and less often by denials   or low cognition. In medium performing groups, high cognition   was preceded more often by high cognition or planning. As these   results indicate that different sequences among students   cognitive, metacognitive and relational activities are linked to   levels of performance, they can inform a micro-temporal theory   of socially shared regulation.

INTRODUCTION  Students who orchestrate their individual self-regulation and   collective socially shared regulation during group activities often   learn more than other students [1]. This socially regulated   learning is a dynamic process; group members adjust the level of   control and monitoring to the learning context, the learning task,   knowledge and skills of the other group members. Yet, there are   few studies of socially regulated learning dynamics [2].    During collaborative learning, students support one anothers   learning as they discuss, elaborate, argue, confirm and regulate   one anothers activities. Regulative activities such as   metacognitive (i.e., planning, monitoring) and relational activities   (i.e., confirming, engaging) aid students learning [3]. Moreover,   sequences among cognitive, metacognitive and relational   activities link them to one another [4]. Yet, researchers have not   systematically examined the relationships between these   sequences of learning activities and group performance. In this   study of 54 primary school students (18 triads), we test whether   sequences of students cognitive, metacognitive and relational   activities are related to group performance. Our results can help   us build a micro-temporal theory of socially regulated learning   and inform our instructional practices [5].     2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  We begin by discussing the need for understanding micro-  temporal characteristics of socially regulated learning. Then, we   consider the transitions between cognitive, metacognitive and   relational activities and the relation with learning performance.    2.1 Micro-temporal, socially regulated   learning   A micro-temporal theory of socially regulated learning explains   how cognition, regulation and motivation interact over time   during collaborative learning, specifically how students regulate   their learning differently across various situations [1, 5]. Thus, to   understand socially regulated learning, we examine learning   context, task, support and other group members attributes, in   addition to individual characteristics [6].    Accordingly, we conceptualize socially regulated learning as a   series of processes that unfolds over time [5, 7, 8], explicating its   sequential and temporal characteristics. The sequential   characteristics of SocRL reflect which actions typically follow   each other; in Molenaar and Chiu [4] for example,  confirmation   of a group members idea was more often followed by reading   and processing of information, whereas denial of a group   members idea was more often followed by elaboration and   questioning. The temporal characteristics of these actions   indicate when they occur and how they influence each other over   time [7]. In Azevedo et al. [9] for example, students planned more   at the start than at the end. As most studies of SocRLs temporal   and sequential characteristics have been exploratory [2], our next   step is to statistically model characteristics that contribute to   group performance [3].

When students go beyond   the information provided to create new ideas, elaborate them, or   connect different ideas (high cognition [10]), they are more likely   than reading or processing information (low cognition) to   contribute high quality parts to the final group paper. Thus, we   expect high performance to be linked more closely to both   instances and sequences of higher cognition rather than that of   cognition. Furthermore, metacognition (planning, monitoring,)   can facilitate subsequent high cognitions and reduce distractions,   both of which might improve group performance. Lastly, positive   relational activities can encourage desirable activities that   enhance group performance, while negative relational activities   can have the opposite effect.   Metacognitive activities monitor, control and align other   activities to the groups learning goals [11]. We view planning as   an important mediator between low and high cognition, consistent   with the positive feedback loop in self-regulated learning theory   [12]. The positive feedback loop specifies that control actions,   such as planning, initiate cognitive activities in line with the task   goals. For example, when the task goal is to compare the climate   of two countries, students plan to list characteristics of both   countries climates in a table to discuss similarities and   differences. After the group has acquired enough information   about the individual climates (low cognition), the controlling   activity planning helps the group to compare the two countries   (high cognition). When cognition is well aligned with the task   goals, this process supports the groups learning performance.   Therefore we expect the sequence planning - high cognition to   support group performance.      Finally, relational activities can engage group members or   confirm the proposed direction both of which support a positive   group climate, which fosters cognition and better group   performance [13]. For example, agreement can encourages a   group mate to elaborate his or her idea. On the other hand,   negative relational activities, such as denial, can discourage   consequent high cognition which might hinder group   performance [14]. For example, after a disagreement, a student is   less likely to continue to elaborate on the previously mentioned   topic.   3. THIS STUDY  This study tests whether sequences of socially regulated learning   are related to group performance. We expect that instances and   sequences of high cognition; planning activities (the positive   feedback loop) and monitoring (via the negative feedback loop)   support performance.    3.1 Method   54 primary school students (18 triads) engaged in 51.338 face-to-  face turns of talk while working in a computer learning   environment for 6 hours (see detailed description in Molenaar et   al. [3]). Conversations were audio-taped with voice-recorders.   We analyzed their learning activities with content analysis and   statistical discourse analysis (SDA; [14]).    3.2 Participants   Teachers rated students as low, middle or high achievers based on   their reading, writing and computer abilities. Then, they created   triads with one low-, one middle- and one high-achiever, with at   least one boy and one girl.    As coding all students turns of talk requires enormous time and   labor, we randomly drew a smaller sample of 18 triads (one in   each of 3 conditions from each class) for this study. The 23 boys   and 31 girls were from six classes in three elementary schools   all in outer city, suburban areas with white, middle-class   populations. The students in this sample consisted of 9 fourth   graders, 27 fifth graders, and 18 sixth graders.    3.3 Procedure   The teacher gave the triads of students the assignment below and   monitored their progress. Each triad worked together face-to-face   in small groups on one computer. The study consisted of eight   lessons, each lasting one hour. In the first lesson, the students   completed a pre-test (about the country to be studied, Cronbachs   alpha was 0.88 for the Iceland test and 0.92 for the New Zealand   test). Then, they received instructions about the assignment and   the virtual environment. In the last lesson, the students completed   two post-tests, a metacognitive test and the country knowledge   test (same as the pre-test).    During the middle 6 lessons, the triads worked on an assignment   called Would you like to live abroad Its goal was to explore a   country of choice (New Zealand or Iceland), write a paper on their   findings and decide whether to live in this country. Before writing   a paper about the selected country, the students completed four   sub-tasks: (a) introduce themselves to the expert, (b) write a goal   statement, (c) select a country and (d) specify topics of interest in   a concept map. In this studys e-learning environment Ontdeknet,   each country expert shared information on these topics and   answered student questions on a webpage, edited by the   Ontdeknet editor [15].   All tasks, including writing of the paper, were integrated into each   triads virtual workspace. The e-learning environment stored all   clicks and edits. All lessons were supervised by one of the   authors, who did not participate in the lessons.    To control for classroom effects, we randomly assigned triads in   each class to one of the three scaffold conditions: (a) none   (control), (b) structuring, or (c) problematizing. In a computer   environment, scaffolds are messages that support a student on a   task that he or she cannot accomplish alone [16]. For students in   the structuring scaffold or problematizing scaffold conditions, the   computer environment analyzed the students attention focus,   behavior and progress on the task [17]. Using this information,   the system dynamically determined when metacognitive   activities should occur during each groups discussion and   showed at least 12 scaffolds to the students [17]. In the control   group, the avatar David occasionally asked how they were   feeling, but did not show any metacognitive scaffolds.          Figure 1. Example of structuring (left) and problematizing   (right) scaffolds for the task introduction.      237    In the structuring condition, triads received direct metacognitive   support; for example, the avatar David showed an exemplary plan   of a task The expert would like to know what you want to learn.   Please write all the topics about New Zealand that you would like   to learn more about in this mind map (see figure 1). In the   problematizing condition, scaffolds elicited students   metacognitive activities and explanations; for example, the avatar   David asks, How are you going to make a mind map These   students could write their answers in a text box on the screen.        3.4 Analysis   We analyzed the learning activities with content analysis and   statistical discourse analysis (SDA, [14]). Content analysis   yielded codes for each turn of talk. Then, we used SDA to model   how earlier activities and their interactions with group   performance were related to high cognition.    3.4.1 Content analysis    The unit of analysis was a speakers turn of talk. Each turn of talk   was coded with one main category code (cognitive,   metacognitive, relational, procedural; see table 1 based on   Veldhuis-Diermanse, [18]). All categories and their subcategories   were mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The first author and a   research assistant independently coded two randomly selected   protocols (2500 turns), with high inter-rater reliability for the   main categories [19] (Cohens kappa k = 0.92; lowest k = 0.82 for   the non-codable category and highest k = 0.94 for the   metacognitive activities).   Table 1. Main coding categories for each turn of talk.    Main category Description   Cognitive activity About task content (e.g.,  elaboration)    Summarizing Recapture previous contributions   Metacognitive activity Monitor or control cognitive activities    Relational activity  Social interactions among students    Procedural activity Regarding procedures for using the   learning environment   Teacher / Researcher Turns by the teacher or the researcher.   Off task  Unrelated to the task.   Not codable Too unclear to interpret      The cognitive activity category contains turns about the task   content (e.g., reading the material, asking a question about the   domain, discussing the learning task, elaborating specific issues   and summarizing previous contributions). Low cognition   includes reading and processing. High cognition includes asking   questions and elaborating [10]. As researchers have debated   whether summarizing is a cognitive or a metacognitive activity   [20], we kept summarizing as a separate category. Metacognitive   activity includes turns that monitor or control cognitive activities   (orientation, planning, monitoring, evaluation and reflection,   [21]). Relational activity includes turns regarding students social   interactions (engaging other group members, denying or   conforming to one anothers ideas).    3.4.2 Group performance    Each triads final paper score (ranging from 0 to 6) was the scaled   sum of two scores: (a) number of different topics about the   country and (b) the percentage of students formulated text   (excluding text provided by the country expert). The latter was   computed using Wincopyfind 2.6. Two independent researchers   counted the number of topics covered in the paper. 28% of the   papers were scored by two independent researchers (Cohens   kappa = 0.75). The groups were divided in low, medium and high.   Low scoring groups scored below 3 (mean = 1.2), medium   scoring groups scored between 3 and 4 points (mean = 3.4) and    high scoring groups scored above 4 points (mean = 5.6).   3.4.3  Statistical Discourse Analysis   We modeled students high cognition with statistical discourse   analysis [14].         High_cognitionijk = F(000 + f0jk + g00k                +00sPerformance00k +00tSchool00k +00uScaffold00k             +00vGroup00k + 0wkStudent0jk             +xjkPrevious_Speaker(i-1)jk + xjkEarlier_Speaker(i-2)jk             +zjkSchool_interactionsijk)       The probability of high cognition at turn i by student j in group k   is modeled via the Logit or Probit link function (F) of the overall   mean 000, and the unexplained student- and group-components   f0jk and g00k (residuals). Wald tests identify significant effects   (likelihood ratio tests are not reliable for multilevel analysis of   binary data). An alpha level of .05 was used. To control for false   positives, the two-stage linear step-up procedure was used. Non-  significant variables were removed. The marginal effect of each   variables total effect (direct plus indirect) was reported as the   increase or decrease (+X% or X%) in the outcome variable.   First, we entered a vector of s performance levels: high   achieving group and medium achieving group (against the   baseline of the low achieving group) (Performance).    Next, we entered t school variables: grade and school   (School). Then we added the interactions of the above variables   with high achieving group and medium achieving group   (Interaction).    Then, we applied the procedure for School to u   scaffolding conditions: structuring scaffold and problematizing   scaffold (Scaffold). Next, we applied these procedures to v group   variables: group size, ratio of girls, group mean of pretest scores,   and group SD of pretest scores (Group). Afterwards, we applied   these procedures to w student variables: age, gender, pretest score,   and study country (New Zealand vs. Iceland) (Student).   Next, we applied these procedures to previous speaker   variables (vector autoregression, VAR). More recent actions   might have stronger effects [31], so previous speaker variables   were added in reverse order, first at lag 1 (previous turn or 1):   high cognition (1), low cognition (1), summarize (1),   evaluation (1), deny (1), monitoring (1), confirm (1),   planning (1), reflection (1), motivation (1), engage (1), and   orientation (1) (Previous_Speaker). Then, x variables at lag 2   were added (Earlier_Speaker), and so on until lag 6.       4. RESULTS  4.1 Summary statistics   The 54 students (in 18 groups of 3) spoke for 51,338 turns.  33   students studied New Zealand and 21 students studied Iceland.   Students showed low cognition in 25% of the turns and high   cognition in only 2% of the turns.    4.2 Explanatory model   About 10% of the differences in likelihood of high cognition   occurred across groups, and 90% occurred across turns of talk   differences across students were not significant. All results   discussed below focus on differences in group performance and   describe first entry into the regression, controlling for all   previously included variables.   238    Group performance, school variables, and attributes of prior   conversation turns were all significantly linked to students high   cognition (see Figure 2). High-achieving groups showed 1% more   high cognition compared to low- or medium- achieving groups.   Meanwhile, medium- or high-achieving groups in school 3   showed slightly more high cognition than those in other schools   did (by 1% or 0.01%, respectively). In contrast, low achieving   groups in school 3 had 1% less high cognition compared to other   schools. Together, group performance and school variables   accounted for 31% of the differences in high cognition across   groups and 7% of the total variance in high cognition.            Figure 2. Path diagram of final 3-level model predicting high   cognition. Solid lines indicate positive effects. Dashed lines   indicate negative effects. Thicker lines indicate larger effect   sizes. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.      Attributes of the previous turn were also linked to students high   cognition. In low and medium achieving groups, low cognition   was 1% more likely to be followed by high cognition. In contrast,   low cognition in high achieving groups was 0.01% less likely to   be followed by high cognition.   The impact of the characteristics of conversation turns was not   limited to only the next conversation turn. After students in low   or high achieving groups planned, the speaker two turns later was   1% less likely to express high cognition (Table 3, panel A, model   4). In contrast, after students in medium achieving groups planned   the learning process, the speaker two turns later was 1% more   likely to express high cognition.    After a student in high achieving groups denied others' ideas, the   speaker four turns later was 0.5% less likely to express high   cognition.    After a student in medium or high achieving groups expressed a   high cognition, the speaker six turns later was 2% or 1% more   likely to express high cognition, respectively. Moreover, after a   student in a medium achieving group planned, the speaker six   turns later was 1% more likely to express high cognition.    5. DISCUSSION  Past research has shown that scaffolding, cognition,   metacognition and relational activities can support cognition   during collaborative learning and showed statistically significant   micro-level relationships among sequences of these activities [3].   However the relationships between these sequences and group   performance have not yet been examined. The results of this study   showed how low, medium and high performing groups are   associated with different sequences among students cognitive,   metacognitive and relational activities. The remainder of this   section considers the implications of the primary results, how   different sequences of cognition, metacognition, relational   activities influence group performance.    High performing groups show greater likelihoods of not only high   cognition but sequences of high cognition. As expected, high   performing groups were more likely to produce high cognition at   each turn of talk, which in turn are more likely to contribute to the   completion of the task. Moreover, medium and high performing   groups show more sequences of high cognition  followed by   subsequent high cognition. These results are consistent with past   studies showing extensive periods of meaning making in higher   performing groups [10, 22].   Unlike other groups, medium performing groups showed   planning (-2 and -6) before high cognitive activities (a positive   feedback loop). This result suggests that planning facilitates high   cognition, which improves performance but not to the highest   level. Future research can examine this result further.   Finally, the high performing groups seemed more sensitive to the   group climate. After a denial, high cognition was less likely.   Overall, low, medium and high performing groups of students   show different sequences of cognitive, metacognitive or relational   activities. The findings suggest that high and medium performing   groups tend to transfer more flexibly among metacognitive,   relational  and cognitive activities, compared to low performing   groups.    Insights into the relations between sequences of learning activities   and group performance form the foundation needed for a micro-  temporal theory of socially regulated learning [2, 4]. The results   indicate that high cognition and sequences of high cognition   support group performance. Also, metacognitive planning   supports high cognition. Finally, denial as shown in previous   studies can reduce high cognition. These findings show how   sequential characteristics of socially regulated learning influence   group performance.    This paper takes modest steps towards connecting sequences of   socially regulated learning to the group performance. However,   several limitations need to be addressed in future work. Currently,   only group performance was connected to sequences within the   groups learning activities; a natural next step is to also include   individual student performance. This paper is based on extensive   and labor intensive coding of collaborative discourse.
