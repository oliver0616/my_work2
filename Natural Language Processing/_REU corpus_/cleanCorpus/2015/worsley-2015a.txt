In this paper, we both add to  and extend this discussion by analyzing the emergence of four  affective states associated with disequilibrium: joy, surprise,  neutrality and confusion; in a collaborative hands-on, engineering  design task. Specifically, we conduct a comparison between two  learning strategies to make salient how the strategies are associated  with different affective states. This comparison is grounded in the  construction of a probabilistic model of student affective state as  defined by the frequency of each state, and the rate of transition  between affective states. Through this comparison we confirm prior  research that highlights the importance of confusion as a marker of  knowledge construction, but put to question the notion that surprise  is a significant mediator of cognitive disequilibrium. Overall, we  show how modeling learner affect is useful for understanding and  improving learning in complex, hands-on learning environments.   Keywords  Learning Sciences, Affect, Cognition   1. INTRODUCTION  In recent years the analysis of student affect in education contexts  has gained increased attention (e.g. see [1-5]). In particular,  researchers have found ways to both extract (from video, speech,  human observation and bio-sensing) and embody (within virtual  agents) various affective states. As one can imagine, many of these  projects have jointly been in the service of studying and  understanding student learning while also developing a means to  influence student affect. However, many of these projects have  been situated in the context of individual, computer-mediated  learning environments. The goal of this paper is to extend the  analysis of student affect outside of the traditional context of  computer-mediated interactions. Instead, this paper will involve  analyzing student affect during the course of a hands-on  engineering design task where two students work together over the  course of an hour. Additionally, our analysis of affect will be  discussed in the context of comparing two different learning  strategies from our prior work [6]. In [6] we defined and situated  two engineering design strategies commonly used by students:   example-based reasoning and principle-based reasoning (see [6] for  a brief description of each reasoning strategy.)  With regard to the two experimental conditions we hypothesize that  students in the principle-based reasoning condition would spend  more time expressing disequilibrium than their peers in the  example-based condition. Similarly, we hypothesize that students  in the principle-based condition transition from equilibrium   disequilibrium with greater frequency than their peers in the  example-based reasoning condition.  In approaching this paper we were centrally interested in studying  disequilibrium as proposed by D'Mello and Graesser [5]. In [5] the  authors propose that there are four primary affects that participate  in equilibrium and disequilibrium. Their model suggests that  surprise and joy are two of the emotions that either create or correct  impasses. However, [5] did not have sufficient instances of surprise  or delight to validate the existence of those pathways. Thus, one  contribution of this work is to more closely examine those  pathways. In [5] the authors also describe two direct paths between  equilibrium and disequilibrium. Their hypothesized affect  dynamics graph is reproduced in Figure 1.     Figure 1.

They  used common household materials: one paper plate, 4 ft. of garden  wire, four drinking straws and five wooden Popsicle sticks. The  objective was to use the materials provided to create a structure that  could support a weight of approximately half a pound.

Pairs of students (N=20) were randomly assigned to either use  example- or principle-based reasoning, after controlling for prior  education experience. Both conditions were initially shown a  picture of a bridge, a ladder and an igloo. In the example-based  condition after seeing the three pictures, students generated three  example structures from their home, community or school. These  student-generated example structures were to be used as inspiration  for their eventual design. In the principle-based condition students  identified three engineering principles that conferred strength and  stability to a ladder, an igloo and a bridge before embarking on the  building task.  Frontal images were generated from a Kinect sensor and used to  create a video of each students head and face. These videos were  then processed using FACET (previously known as CERT).  FACET uses facial action units to predict the presence or absence  of seven different affective states. Since we are only interested in  the states directly related to cognitive disequilibrium, we only  included surprise, joy, neutral and confusion in our analyses.    2.1 Analyses  We conducted two analyses of the student facial expressions. In the  first analyses we looked at average evidence of each facial  expression during the experiment. This analysis allows us to test  the hypothesis that students in principle-based reasoning condition  demonstrated higher values for joy, confusion and surprise than  their peers in the example-based reasoning condition.  For the second analysis we compute transition probabilities based  on the most dominant expression at a given time step. We only  focus on time steps in which the student experienced a change in  dominant facial expression. By looking at the transitions we can  explore the hypotheses that students in the principle-based  reasoning condition had a greater number of transitions between  equilibrium and disequilibrium.    3. Results  An analysis of ordinary variance (ANOVA) was run to determine  the variance between experimental groups. Based on the results  from that analysis confusion significantly differs by condition, with  the principle-based condition expressing higher confusion evidence  (p(18) < 0.05) than the example-based condition. However, there  was not a difference in the evidence for joy, surprise or neutral.   Next we looked at the number of transitions for: Neutral   Confusion, Confusion Neutral, SurpriseConfusion and  JoyNeutral. Recall that these are the expressions that the  literature describes as being relevant. We again perform an  ANOVA, and find that the two experimental conditions  significantly differed in their transition behavior from Neutral  Confusion (p (18) <0.05), as well as from NeutralSurprise  (p(18)<0.05). As before, students in the principle-based condition  were more likely to transition from NeutralConfusion than  students in the example-based condition.    4. DISCUSSION  The reader will recall that a primary motivation for this research  was to study the model of affective dynamics in [8] as applied to a  hands-on learning environment and to also investigate the different  affective behaviors with each experimental conditional. Based on   the preliminary findings from this study we find mixed  confirmation and disconfirmation. Specifically, expressions of  confusion, and transitioning from NeutralConfusion appear to be  positively correlated with high post-test scores. This conclusion  aligns with [8] and is based on the fact that the principle-based  reasoning strategy was more likely to express confusion and more  likely to transition from NeutralConfusion. These transitions to  confusion are likely to be indicative of greater cognitive  disequilibrium. However, we do not see strong results that indicate  that surprise mediates transitions from NeutralConfusion. Put  differently, it does not appear that surprise is a primary factor in  pushing students towards cognitive disequilibrium. Furthermore,  based on the analysis of transitions, going from NeutralSurprise  was more likely within the example-based reasoning condition, and  was associated with lower post-test scores. Hence, it may be the  case the surprise may be a way to induce impasse, but that it can  also simply be an expression that is associated with a lack of  conceptual understanding of the content.   5. CONCLUSION  In closing, then, by modeling and analyzing student affective state  in a hands-on learning context, and in a comparison across two  experimental conditions, we have 1) confirmed that affect is a  relevant part of studies of human cognition; 2) contributed to the  discussion of cognitive disequilibrium; 3) taken the work of  analyzing student affect to the domain of collaborating engineering  design; 4) examined how two different learning strategies are  evidenced in student affect; and 5) motivated the incorporation of  affect analysis in complex learning environments, potentially as a  tool for teachers and practitioners to leverage in providing  appropriate feedback and assistance to students.     6.
