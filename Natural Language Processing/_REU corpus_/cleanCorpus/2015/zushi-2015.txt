Also, we discuss ways to analyze the recorded mouse trajectories,  response time, and drag and drop (D&D) logs, because these  records are potential indicators of the degree of learners  understanding.

INTRODUCTION  A major goal of this study is to provide learners and teachers with  a practical Web application which will sensitize them to the  crucial aspects of solving WRPs. In WRPs learners are required to  make an English sentence from given words. This type of problem  is a popular means in Japan to measure learners knowledge of  grammatical items, sentence structure, idioms, and usagesthe  command of which is essential for producing correct sentences.  Since Japanese is a synthetic language, it has quite a loose word  order, while in an analytic language like English, word ordering  has an extreme importance to decide the meaning and  grammaticality of the sentence. This is why novice or poor  Japanese learners of English have difficulty in making a correct  English sentence, and WRPs are effective in confirming the   ability needed to produce English sentences. In the process to  achieve our goal, we have been developing software that records  mouse movements when learners solve problems, so that teachers  can analyze the mouse trajectories and other study logs in order to  ascertain the understanding levels of learners. There have been  several analyses of mouse movements such as Arroyo, E. et al.  (2006) and Freeman, J. B. and Ambady, N. (2010), but their goals  were not to ascertain learners understanding levels like ours.   In this paper, we will describe our Web application briefly and  discuss the results from a recent experiment conducted with  learners at a certain Japanese university. Exploration of mouse  movements, we hypothesize, will lead to a better evaluation of  learners performance than mere scores by binary computer  marking system.   2. WEB APPLICATION   Our web application has three modules with independent, but also  interrelated functions, with each module incorporated with special  functions to facilitate both learners and teachers using of this  software. This software has been programmed using PHP,  JavaScript, and MySQL.   1) Study Module requires learners to perform word-reordering  tasks by dragging and dropping each word into the  appropriate position in a sentence, and then to rate their  confidence levels. The module records all mouse trajectories  as well as the timing of D&Ds in answering the problems.    2) Problem Constructing Module, where all teachers have to do  is just type correct sentences in English and the  corresponding meaning in Japanese, has Chunking and Word  Fixing functions. They help teachers adjust the problems  length or avoid double answers to one problem.     3) Retrieval & Analysis Module reproduces all the actions  recorded in the learners mouse trajectories, and analyzes the  study logs both from the learners and problems  perspectives, such as the percentage of correct answers  classified by grammatical items, the total number of  problems attempted, the percentage of overall correct  answers, the average time needed for answering problems,  and the number of times a particular problem attempted by  all learners.   3. EXPERIMENT AND DISCUSSION  An important consideration is how to differentiate a confident  correct answer from a lucky hunch. Both answers are correct, but  one is reached by a learner who has full control of grammatical   Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The latter learner  may have managed to reach the target structure by coincidence  after a long period of fluctuating mouse movements. The fact of  being correct or wrong alone may not always be a true reflection  of the ability tested unless the process of the learners responses  are carefully considered.   The answers reached by learners fell into one of four categories:  1) confident and correct, 2) confident but incorrect, 3) not  confident but correct, and 4) not confident and incorrect.  Confident and correct answers include the most useful logs for  finding characteristic mouse trajectories of answers without  hesitation or uncertainty. The answers from category 3 need very  careful treatment because most computer marking systems may  evaluate them as passing in spite of the fact that learners are not  yet sure of the correct answer, or they might have reached the  correct answers accidentally. There is no need of analyzing the  answers of category 4 for the purpose of ascertaining learners  understanding levels because they clearly do not understand,  which means that they have to review from the beginning.   Through the comparison of confident and not confident answers  in our former experiments, it was found that important parameters  for mouse movements included time needed for answering, D-C  time (duration between a drop and the next click), the number of  D&Ds, and number of U-turns (the right-and-left or up-and-down  mouse movements). As is discussed in Zushi, M. et al. (2012) and  (2014), these parameters could serve as an index of hesitation  resulting from learners lack of confidence.    In order to analyze the parameters in more detail, we conducted  another experiment, asking 20 learners to solve 30 problems on  our system. We collected 581 sets of data, with 19 sets of data  missing owing to recording failure or clicking mistakes on the part  of learners. The 158 answers of category 1 and 26 of category 3  are totally different in mouse trajectories, and we found that time  for answering and D-C time are of great use as indicators which  separate these two types of answers.   Longer time needed for answering is, in the general assumption,  connected to difficulty for learners to solve the problem, and thus  to high rate of incorrect answers. But answer time does not clearly  separate the two groups of correct and incorrect answers.    N: # of data.   M: mean value.   SD: standard deviation.     Fig. 1. Distribution of correct and incorrect answers in terms of answer   time.   Answer time, as is illustrated in the box-whisker diagram (Fig. 1),  is not a perfect classifier of correct and incorrect answers. The  middle range of distribution is a domain for both types of answers.   Compare this with the diagram below (Fig. 2). Both types of     Fig. 2. Distribution of confident and not confident answers in terms of   answer time.   answers are correct, but they are far apart from each other in terms  of confidence levels, and the difference between confidence levels   is illustrated in the time difference needed for answering. Thus,  time for answering and learners confidence are deeply connected,  showing this times availability as clues to uncertainty or  hesitation in the process of solving problems. If an e-Learning  system detects problems whose answers are correct but their  trajectories belong to category 3, the system should not pass the  learners but demand them to review more of the same type of  problems. Another parameter for mouse trajectories that can be an  indicator for confidence is the longest D-C time as shown below  (Fig. 3).     Fig. 3. Distribution of confident and not confident answers in terms of the   longest D-C time.   The more uncertain the learner is of the correct sentence, the  longer the D-C time will be somewhere in performing a task, and  this time can be interpreted as hesitation of mouse movements.   These parameters, combined with excessive D&Ds (i.e., D&Ds  employed more than necessary) will be useful clues not only to  detect difficult problems for a particular learner but also to locate  which part of a problem is difficult for the learner. The process of  answers being produced is a more important clue than the answers  themselves, which might include lucky hunches, when we try to  measure learners understanding levels. Uncertainty and hesitation  in solving problems resulting from lack of knowledge or  inadequate understanding are revealed more clearly in the  processes for answering than in answers themselves.
