Connections can also  be viewed as learning outcomes, i.e. learners social capital  accumulated through distributed learning environments. We  applied linear mixed effects modeling to investigate whether the  social capital accumulation interpreted through learners centrality  to course interaction networks, is influenced by the language  learners use to express and communicate in two connectivist  MOOCs. Interactions were distributed across the three social  media, namely Twitter, blog and Facebook. Results showed that  learners in a cMOOC connect easier with the individuals who use  a more informal, narrative style, but still maintain a deeper  cohesive structure to their communication.

INTRODUCTION  Connectivist Massive Open Online Courses (cMOOCs) scale  learner interactions by sharing, aggregating, and connecting  information through the use of a diverse set of media. This  approach allows learners to interact with each other around  personal goals and common interests, outside of the teacher- controlled environment [1]. However, the distributed and open  nature of cMOOCs complicates research inquiries into learning- related processes occurring in such environments. To date, the  majority of cMOOC research has relied on self-reported  mechanisms such as course evaluations obtained through  participant surveys and identification of skills and capabilities that  effectively support learner participation [2-5].   The establishment of social ties with other learners through  interactions mediated by technology is viewed as integral to the  learning process in cMOOCs [6, 7]. The quality of the  relationships between the learners in a networked environment  can be understood through the concept of social capital [8].  Essentially, a large amount of social capital reflects strong and  productive relationships, based on the common interests and  shared understanding among the participants [9, 10]. In this study,  we further rely on the concept of social capital to describe the  individual learning outcomes that result from the user interactions  in cMOOCs using social media. Given that the social network  analysis focuses on the relationships between individuals, rather  than individuals and their properties [10], it is commonly used to  assess the social capital and estimate the opportunities and  limitations inherent to an individual actors position in a social  network [11]. For example, in an analysis of Twitter-based  interactions within a cMOOC, Skrypnyk et al. [12] reported that  an increase in the number and density of the communication acts  resulted in an increased percentage of participants sharing the  power and control over the information flow with the original  course facilitators.

Consequently, individual positions in a learner  network may indicate a degree of influence or faster access to  more human and technological resources in the particular course.   The present study investigated the influence of learners linguistic  and discourse patterns, using an automated text analysis tool, on  the accumulation of social capital. We analyzed the social  networks extracted from the learner interaction within the three  social media platforms (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, and blogs) that  were used in two cMOOCs - namely, CCK11 and CCK12, as  defined shortly. Specifically, linear mixed effects modeling  assessed the association between the accumulation of social  capital (determined through SNA) in a cMOOC and the linguistic  and discourse features [13] used by learners in the content created  and shared in social media.    2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND  2.1 Social Capital  Individual positioning inside a social structure often yields  material and symbolic resources that can be organized in a  network of relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition  [11]. The invariable benefits of such networks are often called  social capital. In educational research, social capital has helped to  explain how the frequency and quantity of learner interactions and  relationships is related to academic performance and drop out [14,  15]. There are links between academic work, social capital theory,  and learning. For example, Gaevi et al. [16] reported that  learners social capital is associated with the academic  performance, whereas Kovanovi et al. [17] connected social  capital with the social presence in the communities of inquiry.   Social network analysis as a theory and method allows us to  translate the abstract metaphor of social capital into an observable  construct [11]. Specifically, measuring network structural  properties, such as centrality, we are able to assess indicators  describing the social capital accumulated by each individual in the  network of learners. Besides focusing on the structural properties,  SNA also provides information about the nature of the  relationship and the strength of ties between learners. Therefore,  in this paper, the semantic meaning and value of the interactions  defines a tie between them, whereas measures of node centrality  (i.e., degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvalue) are used to  obtain a multi-dimensional measure of learners social capital.   2.2 Language Use  Researchers typically rely on structural properties, as measured  through SNA, when exploring online interactions. However, the  interactions themselves customarily take place in natural  language. From this view, language and discourse play a unique  role in computer-mediated learning environments. It is the  predominate channel used by learners to exchange thoughts and  content. Moreover, the connection between discourse and social  ties within a network is well established in numerous  anthropological, sociological and sociolinguistic studies (for a  review, [10]). Automated linguistics analysis methods are  particularly well suited for handling the increasing scale of  educational data. In line with this, linguistic analysis could  provide rich contextual information to the behavioral patterns  derived through SNA techniques. However, the combination of  these two analytical methods is notably scarce in the literature,  although there are exceptions [18]. The goal of this paper is to fill  the large gap between semantic content analyses and SNA.  Specifically, we adopted a theoretically grounded, computational  linguistic analysis approach in combination with SNA to explore  student interactions within an xMOOC. Psychological  frameworks of discourse comprehension and learning have  identified the representations, structures, strategies, and processes  at multiple levels of discourse [19][21]. Five levels have   frequently been offered in these frameworks: (1) words, (2)  syntax, (3) the explicit textbase, (4) the situation model  (sometimes called the mental model), and (5) the discourse genre  and rhetorical structure (the type of discourse and its  composition). We embrace this multilevel approach to language  and discourse in the current paper.   3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS  Language and discourse is a channel of communication that is  central to the information exchange within a network of learners,  so the features of the communication channel are the main  determinants of the social and cognitive processes that evolve in  social networks [22]. The main premise of this study is that  language and the quality of social ties established between  learners in a cMOOC are mutually dependent and correlated.  Building on this premise, we defined our research question as  follows:  RQ: How does the language used by learners in a cMOOC  influence the accumulation of the social capital   4. METHODS  4.1 Data  This study examined the learner interaction occurring within  blogs, Twitter and Facebook social media from the 2011 and 2012  editions of the Connectivism and Connective Knowledge (CCK)  course. Both offerings were facilitated over a 12 week period.   Live sessions were delivered using Elluminate, while course  resources were delivered via gRSShopper. For the purpose of the  automated data collection, we used gRSShopper as the source of  links to blogs and copies of tweets. Facebook data from the  courses open group were collected using Facebook API in order  to retrieve communication between course participants. Finally, in  order to support the analysis of content created in multiple  languages, messages posted in languages other than English were  translated using Microsoft Translation API (around 5% of the all  messages).   The total number of active learners (Ncck11=997, Ncck12=429)1 was  higher during the CCK11 course, which was also reflected in the  number of the posts created within the CCK11 (Npost11=5711,  M=2.59, SD=4.47) and CCK12 (Npost12=2951, M=3.41, SD=9.06).  However, despite a smaller cohort in the CCK12 course, the  participants demonstrated a higher average activity (Facebook:  Npost11f=1755, Npost12f=61; blogs: Npost11b=1473, Npost12b=624).  Twitter-mediated communication sustained similar high levels of  activity for both courses (Npost11t=2483, Npost12t=2266).   4.2 Analyses  4.2.1 Social Network Analysis  We constructed 72 undirected weighted graphs to represent  interactions independently mediated by the three media (i.e.,  Twitter, blogs and Facebook) for each week of the two courses.  Twitter-based social networks included all the authors and  mentions as nodes of the network. The edges between two nodes  were created if an author was tagged within the tweet. For  example, if a course participant @L1 mentioned learners @L2  and @L3 in a tweet, then the course Twitter network would  contain @L1, @L2, and @L3 with the following edges: @L1- @L2, and @L1-@L3. Social graphs from Facebook and blog  communication included authors of the posts, i.e. blog owners or  Facebook post initiators, as well as authors of comments to either  of these. Specifically, if a learner A1 created a blog or Facebook  post, and then learners B1 and C1 added comments to that post,  the corresponding network would include nodes A1, B1, and C1  with the following edges: A1-B1, and A1-C1. All the weekly                                                                    1 Number of students for courses under study, represents the number of active   students that participated in communication using three social media platforms  analyzed.   65    social graphs extracted, included authors who posted and/or  commented within the given week only.  The concept of node centrality is commonly used to assess the  importance of an individual node within the network [23].  Therefore, the following well-established SNA measures [24]  were calculated for each learner in all the network graphs: degree  centrality (i.e., the  number of edges a node has in a network),  eigenvalue centrality (i.e., the measure of influence of a given  node on other nodes), closeness centrality (i.e., the distance of an  individual node in the network from all the other nodes), and  betweenness centrality (i.e., the number of shortest paths  between any two nodes that pass via a given node). For the  analyses of the social network variables we used igraph 0.7.1  [25], a comprehensive R software package for network analysis.  4.2.2 Linguistic Analysis  In order to conduct linguistic analysis, we parsed all the learner  generated posts across the three media in weekly chunks.  Specifically, all the posts produced by Learner 1 using Twitter as  a media, during the first week of a course, were treated as a single  unit. However, all the text produced by the same learner on  Facebook within the same week in the same course was treated as  another unit. Discourse analyses were conducted using Coh- Metrix computational linguistic facility [13], [26]. Coh-Metrix is,  arguably, the most comprehensive automated textual assessment  tool that allows for analysis of higher level features of language  and discourse [13], [26]. In this study, we calculated the following  five Coh-Metrix principal components, for the each unit of  analysis: narrativity (i.e., the extent to which the text is in the  narrative genre), deep cohesion (i.e., the extent to which the ideas  in the text are cohesively connected), referential cohesion (i.e.,  the extent to which explicit words and ideas in the text are  connected with each other as the text unfolds), syntactic  simplicity (i.e., sentences with few words and simple, familiar  syntactic structures), and word concreteness (i.e., the extent to  which content words that are concrete and meaningful).   4.2.3 Statistical Analysis  All the variables (i.e., centrality measures and Coh-Metrix  principal components) were measured at the individual level, and  the data were structured in a way that learners were nested within  a course. Therefore, we adopted a mixed-effects modeling  approach, which is a recommended method for analyzing such  datasets [27], allowing for more stringent examination of the  effect of language on centrality by controlling for the variance  associated with individual students and course differences. Four  different linear mixed-effects models were constructed (i.e.,  centrality models), one for each of the four dependent variables:  eigenvalue, degree, closeness, and betweenness. Independent  fixed effect variables included five Coh-Metrix principal  components. Moreover, media (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, and  blogs), week, and post count were included as fixed effects.  However, given the scope of this paper, those variables are not  defined and elaborated. To address the impact of individual  variance within a model, the course and learners within a course  were treated as random effects.  The best mixed effects regression model was selected through the  several steps. Besides the model with all the fixed effects  included, null models with the random effects (student within  course, and course slope), but no fixed effects were also  constructed. A comparison of the null model with the centrality  models determined whether language predicts social dynamics  above and beyond the random effects. Intraclass Correlation  Coefficient (ICC), [28], Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and a  likelihood ratio test [29], were used to decide on the best fitting  and most parsimonious model. An effect size (R2) was also  estimated for each model as a goodness-of-fit measure denoting  variance explained [30].   All the statistical analyses were conducted using R v.3.0.1   software for statistical analysis with package lme4, for fitting  linear mixed-effects models [31]. Each of the hypotheses specify a  specific direction in the effect, therefore one-tailed tests were used  for significance testing with an alpha level of .05.   5. RESULTS   5.1 Degree Centrality  The results of the likelihood ratio test between the two models  supported the conclusion that the degree model yielded a  significantly better fit than the null model, 2(19) = 1506.5,  p<.001. Results of the linear mixed-effect analysis (Table 1.  Centrality scores as a function of Coh-Metrix text characteristics)  revealed a significant main effect for Narrativity, F(1, 3042.7) =  4.13 p = .042,  Referential Cohesion,  F(1, 2806.4) = 27.32, p <  .001, Deep Cohesion, F(1, 3034.1) = 4.22, p = .040, Syntax Ease,  F(1, 3033.8) = 4.49, p = .032. Specifically, individuals with a  significantly lower degree centrality expressed themselves with a  higher degree of referential cohesion and text simplicity.  However, the learners with higher centrality scores had higher  deep cohesion and narrativity.    Table 1.

Standard error (SE). N= 3066.   5.2  Eigenvalue Centrality  Similar to the degree model, the likelihood ratio test between the  null model and the eigenvalue model revealed a significantly  better fit of the model that accounted for variation of students  within different courses (2(19)= 681.62, p<.001). The model  (Table 1. Centrality scores as a function of Coh-Metrix text  characteristics) showed a significant negative effect of Referential  Cohesion, F(1, 2667.4) = 13.33, p < .001. Specifically, learners  who exhibited lower scores for referential cohesion had higher  eigenvector centrality values.    5.3 Betweenness and Closeness Centrality  We initially fit the same models with respect to degree and  eigenvalue centrality to investigate how linguistic features of  computer-mediated communicative utterances predict  betweenness and closeness centrality. The models with all fixed  and random effects resulted with better overall goodness-of-fit  measures (AICc, R2, and ICC). However, further investigation of  the results for the random effects showed the perfect negative  correlation between random effects specified. This indicates that  the model overfitted the data [32]. Therefore, we decided to  discard models with random slope and continue analysis with the  simpler models (i.e., student within a course as a random effect).   The closeness model did not reveal any significant linguistic  properties and therefore is not further elaborated. In the case of  the betweenness model, the likelihood ratio test with the null  model indicated a better fit of the model that included fixed and  random effects (2(19)= 390.28, p<.001). Reflecting on the  solution for the fixed effects, we were able to identify a significant  negative effect of Referential Cohesion, F(1, 3026.6) = 4.19, p =   66    .041 and Syntactic Ease, F(1, 3042.3) = 5.04, p = .025. The results  show that course participants who tended to use simple linguistic  constructs with higher referential cohesion had lower  betweenness centrality.   6. DISCUSSION  6.1 Interpretation of the results   The results indicate that deep level linguistic characteristics (i.e.,  Coh-Metrix indices) influence learner interaction within a  cMOOC. This paper did not examine surface level features (e.g.,  count of posts), however it supports the claim that a systematic  and deeper analysis (beyond the surface level dialogue  characteristics) is necessary in order to obtain a more  comprehensive insight into the linguistic processes that shape  learning in network settings and influence the development of  social connections [33].  The results suggested that linguistic and discourse features of  written artefacts are important determinants of learning in a  cMOOC environment. Specifically, our results show that learners  whose discourse was more narrative, with deeper cohesion, more  complex linguistic structures, and low referential cohesion had  more connections, and interacted more often with their peer  learners and instructors. Likewise, learners who authored posts  with low values of referential cohesion had more ties with the  most influential, well-connected learners, as indicated with higher  values of eigenvalue centrality. Finally, higher potential for the  control of communication and brokerage of information (i.e.,  higher betweenness centrality) included learners who tend to  integrate new information (i.e., lower cohesion) within each post  and who had a discourse that was more syntactically embedded.  Thus, what is the overall effect of deep level linguistic and  discourse properties on the accumulation of learners social  capital in a cMOOC Course participants who tend to use more  narrative and informal style, nevertheless still manage to maintain  a deeper cohesive structure in their communication will have  more ties. That being said, we were able to conclude that  language does define structural positions within the social  network emerging from the interaction in network learning  environment. The way the learners convey the messages and share  the information, could potentially bring them benefits in terms of  strengthening ties with peer learners and consequently increase  the social capital [11].  It is also indicative that individuals who created posts with higher  referential cohesion, attracted attention (i.e., comments and  reactions) from fewer participants. Given that referential cohesion  captures the extent to which ideas in the text are connected with  each other as the text unfolds, higher referential cohesion  indicates fewer gaps in conveying the ideas and increased text  readability and comprehension [19]. On the other hand, referential  cohesion gaps occur when a sentence has few if any words that  overlap with previous sentences. [19]. A possible explanation for  the relation of lower referential cohesion and possibly complex  syntactic structure with increased social capital could be  connected to the affordances of media used in the analyzed  cMOOC, i.e. Twitter and Facebook posts were noticeably shorter  than blog posts. This further implies that, in terms of overlap  between sentences and paragraphs, paragraph-to-paragraph  measures should be interpreted as post-to-post referential  cohesion. In this context, the lower referential cohesion might be  capturing a lack of overlap between an individual learners posts.  In this case, learners who tend to post more topically diverse  messages would naturally have less overlap and consequentially  lower referential cohesion values of their posts compared to their  more topically uniform counterparts. Therefore, it is likely that  learners who tended to provide novel information across their  posts, attracted more peers and attained more followers.  Likewise, low referential cohesion across the discourse might  indicate that those learners triggered many discussions about   dilemmas and challenging topics. High referential cohesion  might indicate the redundant information across the posts with  lack of the real contribution to discussions and knowledge  development. Such interpretations should, however, be taken with  a degree of caution until further studies test replications and  relevant interpretations.   6.2 Implications for theory and practice  Our findings have shown that learners ability to effectively use  language to communicate and share knowledge with peers is  essential to the building new ties and strengthening existing  connections. Moreover, being able to recognize important  information and coherently develop new ideas building on the  existing knowledge ultimately leads to the accumulation of social  capital. Finally, observed from the linguistic perspective, sharing  novel information, using concrete and coherently structured  language (i.e., written text) is perhaps the main prerequisite for  establishing new connections within the network of learners. It  seems that in highly distributed environments of cMOOCs,  learners tend to value new information, new ideas, triggering  novel potentially interesting and relevant discussions, rather than  elaborating on a single topic (or a small number of topics)  throughout a course. However, these new information have to be  comprehensive, well-structured in order to increase understanding  among learners and foster the interaction. Nevertheless, further  research is needed to assess individuals ability not only to  develop a social capital, but also to take advantages of the  accumulated social capital for a specific return (e.g., to facilitate  the achievement of learning outcomes).  It is questionable whether learners would be able to develop all  the necessary skills for learning in networked environment simply  by interacting with their peers. Therefore, future research needs to  investigate various instructional scaffolds and available  technological affordances that would provide guidelines for  students in developing necessary skills for learning in such  settings. Those skills, identified as new media literacies [34],  should enable learners to use media affordances more efficiently  thus gaining more from learning in distributed learning contexts.  Eventually, changes in the way learners use the linguistic features  could provide an insight into individuals progress in the  development of those literacies. On the other hand, as indicated by  various studies on online and distance education, personalized,  formative and timely feedback presents one of the most promising  approaches for fostering learning in online settings [35, 36].  Information gleaned from these findings suggests discourse  analytics could prove useful in creating personalized feedback for  students interacting within computer-mediated, networked  platforms in the future. For instance, a system could provide  accurate real time support for learners using an interface that  delivered suggestions via a simple pop up window or a more  sophisticated intelligent agent. Such computer-mediated support  could help course participants develop improved information  transfer and gathering skills. However, the value of such  enhancements awaits future work and empirical testing.  Nevertheless, this research might represents an initial step, by  highlighting potentially useful analytical tools, and stimulating  discussion about MOOC platforms capable of enhanced dynamic  social processing, and automated cognitive evaluation for learner  feedback.   6.3 Limitation  It is important to acknowledge limitations of this study. At the  time we were collecting the data for the analysis (April-August  2014), tweets posted within the both courses under study were no  longer available through Twitter API. Given that we obtained  those data using gRSShopper as a source, some of the course  interactions, such as replies, retweets, and favorites, could not be  collected. However, features such as mentions and hashtags, along  with the tweet content, were preserved. Additionally, the study   67    analyzed the data from a course in a specific subject domain. It is  reasonable to assume that different subject domains would be  characterized with different communication patterns. Therefore, it  would be prudent to analyze social interactions within courses  from various subject domains.   7. CONCLUSIONS  Through deep levels of text analyses, our findings show that  linguistic and discourse features have a significant impact on the  accumulation of learners social capital in a networked learning  setting. The findings suggest that facilitators of distributed courses  should consider a broad array of responsibilities that include and  extend simple network-formation beyond shaping and leveraging  the information flows throughout the learning network. For  example, cMOOC facilitators could introduce instructional  elements that enhance group and individual communication skills.  Finally, the study opens up for further investigation of the  relationship between social ties and language in use.    8. REFERENCES  [1] A. A. Mcauley, B. Stewart, G. Siemens, and D.
