Classroom visual design has been previously studied, but not in  terms of the systematic patterns adopted by teachers in selecting  what materials to place on classroom walls, or in terms of the  actual semantic content of what is placed on walls. This is  potentially important, as classroom walls are continuously seen  by students, and form a continual off-task behavior option,  available to students at all times. Using the k-means clustering  algorithm, we find four types of visual classroom environments  (one of them an outlier within our data set), representing teachers  strategies in classroom decoration. Our results indicate that the  degree to which teachers place content-related decorations on the  walls, is a feature of particular importance for distinguishing  which approach teachers are using. Similarly, the type of school  (e.g. whether private or charter) appeared to be another significant  factor in determining teachers design choices for classroom  walls. The present findings begin the groundwork to better  understand the impact of teacher decisions and choices in  classroom design that lead to better outcomes in terms of  engagement and learning, and finally towards developing  classroom designs that are more effective and engaging for  learners.

INTRODUCTION  Throughout the history of education, there has been interest in  designing classrooms for children that best support effective  pedagogy. The goal has been to select spatial designs for  childrens classrooms that likely influence both pedagogy and  experience in meaningful fashions [21]. Much of the literature in  this area has considered the layout of desks and students, such as  whether desks point to the teacher, or students sit in circles facing  each other [13]. Another theme has been the visual design of the  classroom. Colorfully decorated walls have become a staple of  modern classrooms [8]. There has been steady interest in the  impacts of differences in the design and utilization of classroom  walls [9], which students look towards for hours a day [26].  Differences in classroom design can have substantial impacts on  student engagement and learning. In specific, Weinstein [28]  found that extensive shelving and clearer display of materials  reduced off-task behavior and increased the frequency in which  students used manipulative materials and games. By contrast, it  has been hypothesized that colorful room designs may increase  distractibility and off-task behavior, at least for younger learners  [16, 26]. Additionally, Barret et al. [3] reported that several  classroom design parameters were significantly associated with  learning outcomes in elementary school students. Importantly, the  authors initially hypothesized that the features color and  complexity would be positively related to student learning, but  instead found that these features were negatively related to  students learning outcomes.   However, much of this work has considered visual design  attributes in isolation, identifying positive and negative correlates  to learning [25] of specific visual design choices. By contrast,  there is relatively little literature that considers that specific visual  elements may form a systematic design chosen by teachers. In  addition, much of prior work has solely considered the visual  aspects of what teachers place on walls, as opposed to the  semantic content of what is placed on walls.  Better understanding teachers systematic design choices for walls  may be useful towards understanding which designs are more  pedagogically useful, and whether some designs are distracting.  For example, using walls as a posting place for instructional  materials may be distracting to students, causing off-task behavior  [6], carelessness [7], or other forms of disengagement.

While  teachers play a dominant role in influencing students attention,  the amount of time in which students actively attend to  instructional activities is limited; this makes students more  susceptible to distractions within their immediate surroundings  [23]. Identifying the sources of these disengaged behaviors can  help teachers understand what interventions can improve  students patterns of motivation and engagement [10]. Within the  classroom setting, walls have also been used to regulate student  behaviors and attention [cf. 27], displaying classroom rules and  charts about which students are following classroom rules [24].   By considering teachers design choices for walls more  systematically, we may be able to see which overall choices have  positive impacts, and eventually may be able to create wall design  patterns that best promote engagement and learning. Over the  years, educational design patterns have been integrated into  several domains of learning technology, including the  development of computer science courses [4], web-based  instruction [15] and e-learning [11]. These design patterns can in  turn be used in discovery with models analyses [18] to discover  which design patterns are associated with better learning  outcomes and less disengagement. A list of positive design  features is likely to be less useful than a set of design patterns,  since there are several ways to combine the individual  components teachers use in classroom wall design.   One method for understanding systematic choices, that is, which  smaller-scale choices fit together, is to use clustering [20]. A  cluster algorithm can give insight into which individual elements  frequently co-occur, as part of overall patterns. Recent work in  educational data mining has attempted to achieve similar goals  toward the discovery of meaningful patterns in educational data.  Amershi and Conati [1] applied an unsupervised clustering  algorithm to determine which student interaction patterns  distinguished high or low learning; they were able to move from  relatively low-level student actions to understandable and usable  patterns. Similarly, Fouts and Myers [14] made use of clustering  to analyze various types of classroom environments during  science instruction. In specific, classrooms with high levels of  student involvement, teacher support, group affiliation, order and  organization, and teacher innovation were associated with better  attitudes toward science [14]. These studies highlight the value of  using an exploratory approach to study the combination of distinct  features within different learning environments.   In this study, we use clustering analysis to investigate features of  classroom wall design. This analysis adds to the existing literature  on classroom visual and physical design, by studying which wall  design elements go together, and whether there are clusters where  the same type of wall element can be part of very different wall  use strategies.  Within this paper, we research this question using data from 30  elementary school classrooms in the Northeastern United States.  Classrooms were photographed after school, systematically coded  by designers, and analyzed using k-means clustering. Through  this method, we will study the groupings in classroom wall  design.    2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 Data Collection  30 classrooms from local charter, private, and religious schools in  the Northeastern United States were recruited for the present   study. The following was the distribution of the different schools:  14 charter classrooms, 13 private classrooms, and 3 religious  classrooms. Within these schools, the sample included 7  kindergarten classrooms, 7 first-grade classrooms, 7 second-grade  classrooms, 3 third-grade classrooms, and 6 fourth-grade  classrooms. Photographs of classroom walls were taken during the  fall semester (October-December 2012).     2.2 Coding Scheme  To understand the types of flat materials placed on the classroom  walls, we coded for content, using a coding system developed for  this purpose, the Classroom Wall Coding System, CWaCS 1.0.  For each classroom wall photographed, units of analysis were  identified with a box in the qualitative analysis software program  Hyper-RESEARCH v3.5.2 [19]. All units in the walls were then  coded in terms of three categories: academic, non-academic, and  behavior. Academic items are relevant for student learning and  were sub-classified into two sub-categories: academic  organizational and academic topics. Academic organizational  items regard the organization of class activities and were sub- classified into eight sub-categories: goals for the day, group  assignments, job charts, labels, schedule day/week, yearly  schedule, skills, and homework. Academic topics pertain to  specific content learning materials and were further classified into  five sub-categories: content specific, procedures, resources,  calendars/clocks, and other. Non-academic items provide general  information such as school policy, teacher information, and  decorative items. Non-academic items were sub-classified into  five categories: motivational slogans, decorations, decorative  frames, student art, and other non-academic. Behavior materials  aim to influence student behavior (e.g., good behavior charts,  book challenge points). Behavior was subdivided into four sub- categories: behavior management, progress charts, rules, and  other behavior. Two trained coders coded approximately half of  the 30 classrooms each. Both trained coders then coded the same  four classrooms (13%); interrater agreement was very good  (Cohens kappa = .91). Approximately half of the wall displays  (51%) were related to academic content; the other 49% involved  other categories.   2.3 Analytical Method   Given the hierarchical coding scheme, and its application to the  data, we computed the frequency of each type of visual design  feature observed within the four walls of each classroom. We  focused on the upper level of aggregation, given the relative  sparcity of the sub-categories across the relatively small sample of  classes.  We then applied clustering to the resultant data set. Clustering is  defined as the process of grouping a set of objects, such that those  belonging to the same cluster share similarities in their feature  vectors [29].   K-means, the most straightforward and popular clustering  algorithm, was used in the present paper because of its fast and  easy implementation and interpretation. The k-means method  produces k clusters. It first involves the formation of k initial  clusters, typically (and in this case) placed randomly. Given this  initial clustering, member points are allocated according to the  nearest centroids. Once points are allocated, cluster centroids are  reassigned. This process of recalculating and updating the  centroids is repeated until the convergence criteria are met [29].    45    In this paper, since the number of clusters was not prescribed in  advance, different possibilities were randomly applied beginning  with a given minimum of k=1. The results are discussed below.   The next step was to determine what distinguishes classrooms in  terms of visual design features, by studying which variables  characterize each clusters differences from the other clusters. In  order to study this, the means plus and minus one standard  deviation were computed for all attributes within each cluster.  Calculations from both these equations were then compared  against the corresponding overall averages of each type of visual  feature. Significant differences between these values revealed  which visual features each of the resultant clusters were  particularly extreme on.   Clusters were then analyzed based on the distribution of the  different schools (e.g. charter, private, and religious). In  particular, we used the Monte Carlo method to investigate  whether patterns of teachers design decisions were associated  with a particular kind of school.    3. RESULTS   As previously mentioned, we systematically tried different  numbers of clusters within the k-means algorithm.  After 4  clusters, new clusters primarily represented outliers. We found  that k=4 clustering had one singleton (outlier) cluster (already  seen with 2 clusters); the k=5 clustering was identical, except  there was an additional cluster with two outlier data points;  further addition of clusters provided more outlier clusters. Since  outlier clusters do not provide information on cross-class trends,  we selected the clustering analysis for k=4 for further analysis.  The resultant clusters varied somewhat in size: cluster 1 (n=6),  cluster 2 (n=15), cluster 3 (n=8), and cluster 4 (n=1).   In order to identify visual features that distinguished between the  clusters, the means and standard deviations of clusters were  compared against the overall averages of each visual feature.  Table 1 summarizes a list of distinct visual features for each  cluster. Plus and minus signs correspond to high and low values.    There were observable differences between the feature averages  in different clusters. Classrooms grouped in cluster 1 had walls  with considerable numbers of labels and non-academic content,  particularly in the form of decorations. This cluster represented  classroom walls covered with organizational and decorative  content. Cluster 1 was the only group that had average levels of  content-related decorations, whereas the rest of the clusters were  significantly above or below the mean for this feature. As shown  in the high cluster averages and standard deviations, classrooms  included in Cluster 3 were particularly high in terms of academic,  content, decorations, and student art. Cluster 3 reflected walls that  were covered in content-specific and decorative materials.  Conversely, classrooms belonging to Cluster 2 had walls that   were relatively low in academic content, labels, and decorations.  Cluster 2 was also extreme on the content-specific feature, but in  the opposite direction, having classroom walls with relatively  little content-specific content. Classroom walls in cluster 2  classrooms were also low on academic and decorative content.  The singleton Cluster 4 had walls with substantial amounts of  other nonacademic, procedural, and content-specific materials.   Relative to other groups, this cluster represented classroom walls  that were considerably distinct on other nonacademic wall  material, content-specific content, and procedures. Interestingly,  every cluster had at least some wall displays related to classroom  behavior; there was no cluster where this design choice was rare.  In summary, the amount of content-specific and decorative  materials distinguished most of the classrooms. Figure 1  illustrates the differences among clusters in terms of these  features. From this scatterplot, we can see that the classrooms in  Cluster 2 showed relatively low amounts of content-specific and  decorative displays compared to the rest of the other clusters.  Cluster 1 generally had more decorations and content-specific  displays. Cluster 3 had relatively more content-specific content  and less decorations than other classrooms (except for one outlier  within this cluster). Cluster 4 (outlier) was relatively similar to  Cluster 3 in terms of these variables (but differed strongly in  terms of other non-academic content).      3.1 Clusters and Type of School  One additional research question that was asked of this data is  whether the clusters were related to the type of school. In other  words, are some design decisions driven by the fact that the  school is a charter school, a private school, or a religious school    In investigating this, we determined that 5 out of the 6 charter  schools were in Cluster 1, and that 10 out of the 15 private  schools were in Cluster 2. However, it was not clear whether  these proportions were due to chance, and there is not a  straightforward statistical test for answering this question. An  alternative approach is to run a Monte Carlo analysis [17] where  we assume chance distribution of classrooms to clusters (based  solely on the clusters size), and see how often these proportions  are obtained. Hence, in our Monte Carlo analysis, we assumed  that classrooms were randomly assigned to clusters in the  following proportions: Cluster 1 (6/30), Cluster 2 (15/30), Cluster  3 (8/30), and Cluster 4 (1/30), regardless of private, charter or  religious status.     We assigned clusters in this fashion 10,000 times. Based on the  Monte Carlo analysis, we found that the probability that 5 out 6  charter schools would be grouped in Cluster 1 based solely on  their proportion in the data set was 0.0405 (i.e. p=0.0405). The  probability that 10 out of 15 private schools would be grouped in   Table 1: Distinguishing visual features for k=4  Feature Cluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 Cluster 4  Content specific  - + +  Decorations + - +    Labels + -    Other   nonacademic  +   +   Procedures    +  Student art   +        Figure 1: Feature comparisons among clusters   46    Cluster 2 based solely on their proportion in the data set was  0.0131 (i.e. p=0.0131). In both cases, then, random chance would  result in the effect seen less than 5% of the time. This result  indicates that charter schools were disproportionately represented  in Cluster 1 and private schools were disproportionately  represented in Cluster 2. As such, something in the school culture  and practices of charter schools in this region results in  significantly greater amounts of wall decorations than other types  of schools. By contrast, some aspect of the school culture or  practices of private schools in this region results in low numbers  of wall displays.    4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  The present study forms a first step in investigating visual  classroom design using a clustering algorithm. While it is  common practice for teachers to consider and discuss what to  place on the walls of their classrooms, this is rarely an emphasis  in educational research [12]. As such, the implications of this  study provide a first empirical look at how teachers systematically  design the visual classroom environment.   Our findings indicate that one big difference between classrooms  was whether teachers chose to focus their walls on content- specific topics, which combined with other design decisions in  interesting ways. For instance, as mentioned earlier, walls in the  singleton Cluster 4 were predominantly covered with content- specific, procedural, and non-academic materials. The teacher  from this cluster likely made use of visual displays for guiding  student learning, focusing on academic topics and procedures. He  or she also utilized the wall space for posting general information  and teacher-related content. This combination of features may  represent a type of teacher who seems to view visual displays as a  means of recalling or referring to information that is particularly  intended for students or educators.   Similar to this, Cluster 3 was also particularly high on content- specific wall displays. In addition to exhibiting content-specific  topics, a significantly high amount of decorations was observed  within this set of classrooms; this was the only group that had  substantial amounts of student artwork displays. In a national  survey of instructional strategies, Burton [5] found that some  teachers post artworks to engage and motivate their students.  Similarly, teachers from this cluster may regard decorative  materials as motivational tools for learning. However, walls rich  in class work and academic displays do not necessarily indicate  better use of wall space. Considerable amounts of wall displays  can potentially appear cluttered and disorganized, making it more  difficult for students to recognize and find pertinent information  [2]. In addition, content-specific material may not be useful in  many situations, such as mathematics content during a language  arts lesson.  The integration of high academic and decorative material seen in  these clusters is a stark contrast to the classrooms belonging to  Cluster 2. This group of classrooms had the opposite pattern from  Cluster 3, with low amounts of both academic and nonacademic  wall displays. This reflects a set of teachers  many of them  private school teachers  who rarely use academic displays,  labels, or decorations in designing a classroom. Teachers who  refrain from displaying various types of decorative materials may  consider wall decorations to be distractors from learning. It has  also been hypothesized that teacher effectiveness may be higher  when teachers dont need to compete with visually stimulating  wall displays for student attention [2, 26]. Consistent with these  hypotheses, Godwin and Fisher [16] found significantly higher   proportions of student off-task behavior in learning settings  furnished with high amounts of visual materials, as compared to  learning settings with few sources of visual distraction. Further  studies need to be conducted to understand the link between  specific types of classroom decorations and attention, as well as  the motivations behind the infrequent use of specific visual  features by these teachers.   The last cluster, Cluster 1, includes classrooms where walls were  covered with organizational and nonacademic information, rather  than content-specific. Given the substantial amount of labels,  decorations, and teacher-related content, classrooms in this cluster  represent print-rich environments. Since labels were used to  describe materials and areas in the classroom, this set of teachers,  primarily charter school teachers, likely made use of print  displays to help students navigate their way around the classroom.   Features from the behavior category were also not found to be  significant in distinguishing between clusters. Behavior-specific  features were common across all clusters and types of schools.   Considering these clustering findings, the importance of the  content-specific feature suggests that educators have different  approaches in displaying academic content with other decorative  materials. The clusters found also indicate that the display  features can interact in different ways. As shown in Clusters 1 and  2, the preference for posting decorations and labels seems to be  associated with each other.   The degree to which teachers post organizational and decorative  content is possibly related to a certain type of school. This may  relate more broadly to some of the goals adopted at these schools,  as well as more general school culture and practices. For example,  at the Charter schools studied, considerable emphasis is placed on  literacy development; students have 2.5 hours of reading and  writing each day. This may explain why these schools are more  likely to encourage print-rich environments, where students are  immersed in colorful decorations and functional text. This could  also explain why considerable amounts of decorations and labels  were observed in this cluster that was substantially comprised of  charter schools. In contrast, the relatively visually sparse  classrooms represented in Cluster 2 predominantly came from  private schools. This suggests that private school teachers in this  region may consider visual displays distracting. However, these  hypotheses are clearly speculative at this point, and further  research is necessary to explore these possibilities. In particular, it  may be valuable to interview teachers about their classroom  display choices in order to understand these choices better.  Nevertheless, the type of school appears to be another relevant  factor in determining specific patterns in teachers design  decisions.   Overall, the reported findings suggest that there is systematicity in  how teachers from varying schools choose to decorate their  classroom walls. While a number of previous studies note the  importance of classroom design on learning, much of this prior  research discusses design factors as individual components. To  the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to report  clustering outcomes on the systematic patterns teachers use to  design classroom walls. In a classroom setting where  environmental features are all interrelated [3], understanding a set  of design patterns is more pedagogically useful than investigating  features in isolation.   Given that the sample studied here was drawn from a single  region, future broader-scale research is necessary to be able to   47    generalize these results to a wider population of schools and  educators. Beyond this, it may be worthwhile to further examine  why private and charter schoolteachers differ in choices of wall  design, perhaps integrating interviews to better understand these  choices. Another interesting area for future work might be to  explore clustering from the wall level and determine if there are  any significant differences in the content between the main (e.g.  whiteboard and blackboard) and supporting walls. Prior work has  indicated that wall organization strategies, wherein main and  supporting walls are clearly defined, show considerably higher  percentages of skill acquisition in academic tasks [10].   Perhaps, the most important area of future work is to study the  impact of visual design choices on other variables of interest.  Different schools in the region studied make distinct choices  about how to use classroom walls; what are the effects of these  choices There are significant differences in between classrooms  and across classes studied - nearly half of the wall displays is  unrelated to academic topics. It may be valuable to examine how  the visual content and organization of classroom walls influence  student performance. Studying how classroom design choices  influence childrens engagement and learning outcomes will help  us to understand the impacts of these design choices, and to move  towards an era when classroom visual design is engineered based  on data rather than intuition.   5.
