That  workshop succeeded in its aim of catalysing ideas and building  community connections between those working in this field of  social learning analytics. It also proposed a mission statement for  DCLA: to devise and validate analytics that look beyond surface  measures in order to quantify linguistic proxies for deeper  learning. This year, the focus of the second international DCLA  workshop, like that of LAK14, is on the intersection of learning  analytics research, theory and practice. Once researchers have  developed and validated discourse-centric analytics, how can  these be successfully deployed at scale to support learning   Categories and Subject Descriptors  K.3.1 [Computers and Education]: Computer Uses in  Education.

WORKSHOP CONCEPT  The success of the 1st International Workshop on Discourse- Centric Learning Analytics [1] demonstrated that an important  class of learning analytic is emerging that is concerned with the  use of discourse to support learning and teaching. These analytics  are being developed at the intersection of fields including  automated assessment, learning dynamics, deliberation platforms,  and computational linguistics. What moves these developments  into the category of learning analytics, as opposed to research that   sits in any of the above categories, is their use or potential to  generate actionable intelligence specifically in the context of  learning. This may include the development of information  displays that help learners and educators to understand significant  discourse patterns and to reflect on learning dialogue, or tools that  support interventions to improve discourse for learning.   Unlike other analytics, which take measures such as engagement,  attention and test scores as proxies for learning, discourse-centric  analytics offer researchers from different traditions the potential to  focus on the quality of the learning process, using (largely  written) language as a lens on the learners minds. Cognitive  constructivists approach this work from the perspective that  engaging in online dialogue encourages learners to make explicit  what they have stored in their memories, while social  constructivists may be focused on the ways in which dialogue  promotes the collaborative process during which meaning is  negotiated and knowledge co-constructed [2]. Dialogue can reveal  engagement with the ideas of others, the development of  reasoning, shifts in understanding and the ways in which learners  relate new ideas to personal understanding [3]. Studies have  shown that, in a variety of contexts, educational success and  failure can be related to the quality of learners dialogue [4, 5].  From an educators perspective, written discourse is one way of  gaining insights into deeper learning and the higher order qualities  associated with it, including critical thinking, argumentation and  mastery of complex ideas. These skills are difficult to master and  are a focus for assessment, particularly in the field of higher  education. Discourse-centric learning analytics offer the  possibility of using students written drafts to generate feedback  that will help them to reflect upon and improve the ways in which  they express their understanding [6].   The use of these analytics is not confined to the formal learning  sector; they can also be applied to informal learning, where  learners set their own goals and select their own methods of  achieving them. For example, learners can use an Evidence Hub  to make sense of the written ideas of a community. Algorithms  can be used to identify key issues, ideas and evidence and to  support the development of a reflective community of practice by  making it clear where people disagree and why [7].   Potential benefits and applications of discourse-centric analytics  are clear, yet their development and deployment face challenges.  This workshop addresses two of these in particular: fragmentation  of the field and barriers to adoption.

Even within these areas, the work and  its topics are diverse. Researchers focused on networked learning,  computer-mediated collaboration, computer-mediated discussion,  computer conferencing, and asynchronous learning networks may  all be working on similar data but with only limited opportunities  to share their conceptualisations and their findings.   This can result in a failure to build upon the work of others. De  Wever and his colleagues carried out a review of instruments used  for content analysis over a period of 13 years, from 1992 to 2005.  They examined 15 instruments and found that instruments are  hardly compared or contrasted with one another. As a  consequence, the empirical base of the validity of the instruments  is limited [2].   These studies  and the analysis of them as a group  all have  implications for DCLA, but they were carried out before the  emergence of learning analytics as a field of study. A related  cause for concern is therefore that researchers who are new to the  field may neglect or be wholly unaware of relevant work in  related areas. The DCLA community needs to be active in  identifying and sharing key research and development that has  taken place in related fields.   1.2 Barriers to adoption  The concern that researchers in the field of discourse-centric  learning analytics may not build effectively on past work is  mirrored by a concern that they may not be building effectively  for the future. Learning analytics are an element of technology- enhanced learning (TEL); they make use of online data and  computer algorithms to support both learning and teaching.   TEL is a complex system made up of many different elements, all  of which must be taken into account as an innovation is designed,  developed and embedded. Successful implementation of  discourse-centred analytics requires attention to both technology  and pedagogy. It also needs to take into account diverse elements  of the TEL complex, including activities and expectations of  learners and teachers, policies on privacy and data protection,  staff training, technical support, institutional goals and technical  infrastructure [8].   Researchers in this area therefore need to look to the bigger  picture. For these analytics to have real impact, they need to be  capable of working at scale in a variety of different contexts.  Much research and development in this area to date has focused  on catwalk technologies that demonstrate exciting new concepts  but that are also costly, difficult to maintain and impractical for  extended use, particularly if deployed in new areas [9]. Successful   mass exploitation of these analytics requires a ready-to-wear  system that can be used off the shelf without problems.    MOVING FORWARD  The challenges faced by discourse-centric learning analytics  mirror those faced by the field of learning analytics as a whole.  The DCLA workshop series therefore mirrors the development of  the LAK conferences. In 2013, the first workshop began to  address the issue of fragmentation in the field by bringing together  researchers from different communities to share ideas and tools  and to consider shared goals and visions. In 2014, the workshop  looks forward, beginning the task of achieving those goals and  visions by identifying the steps that need to be taken on the way.
