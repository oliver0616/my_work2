In this study, we investigate the poten- tial differential effects of text-based and image-based student learning activities on student learning outcomes in a func- tional anatomy course. When controlling for demographics and prior GPA, participation in in-class image-based activ- ities is significantly correlated with performance on associ- ated exam questions, while text-based engagement is not. Additionally, students rated activities as helpful for seeing images of key ideas and as being significantly less mentally taxing than text-based activities.

Surprisingly, there is little evidence for this approach[3, 6]. For exam- ple, Tangen et al.[8] compare student quiz scores following three different types of lectures  with visuals relevant to the content, with visuals not relevant, and with text-based bullet points  and find no significant difference in accuracy among them. Lin and Atkinson[5] find similar results, albeit for animated vs. static graphics.  However, research on visuals may be helpfully contextual- ized by two key factors. First, visual learning formats may be more beneficial in course contexts requiring the interpre- tation of complex visual material [3, 4], such as anatomy or art history. Second, research on learning through visual- verbal presentations has relied primarily on lecture-based pedagogy, not accounting for the processing time students need to make sense of both pieces of information[5, 8]. There- fore, we offer a important case study of student learning in an anatomy course at the University of Michigan. Anatomy is a discipline with a significant visual component, for stu- dents to recognize and identify corporeal elements such as bones, ligaments, and muscles. Additionally, this course de- votes significant in-class time to active learning, which we hypothesize allows for the cognitive processing needed to en- hance student learning. Previous studies have treated active learning as a separate condition from visual and text-based learning (e.g., Tangen et al.[8], and Bockhoven[1]), but we seek to investigate their integration.  2. METHODS The study analyzes data from a University of Michigan  class, Human Musculoskeletal Anatomy, a sophomore-level course required for all students majoring in Movement Sci- ence. Taught fall and winter terms, the course averages 101 students, and it is comprised of about 60% Movement Science majors and 40% non-majors. The class provides students with an in-depth knowledge of the musculoskeletal system in order to better understand the functional relation- ships between human musculoskeletal anatomy and body movement.  Each class session consists of lecture segments punctuated with active learning activities in which students work inde- pendently or in pair-share dyads to answer interactive ques-  275    Figure 1: Examples of in-class activities  tions asked through LectureTools, interactive presentation software (Fig. 1). Both text-based and image-based activi- ties are included in each class session. Text-based activities consist of a written question and multiple-choice answers. Image-based activities consist of either a question associ- ated with a particular image (and multiple-choice answers) or an image map where students are asked to click on the image in order to answer the question. Student participation on all learning activities is tracked  using LectureTools analytics data. The number of activities in which a student participated is collected for each student. Student learning outcomes are assessed via exam question scores. Individual exam questions are written to correspond to single lecture topics (and therefore either image-based or text-based learning activities). Care is taken to write exam questions of equivalent difficulty. Regression analyses are used to look for correlations between student scores on ex- ams and student participation in learning activities. Demo- graphic data including gender, underrepresented minority status, and cumulative GPA are also included in analyses. Additionally, students were asked to participate in a end-  of-semester survey, which asked them to reflect on how much mental activity (i.e., cognitive load) was required when participating in image- and text-based activities. Survey questions were modeled on the instrument for measuring cognitive load described by Lin & Atkinson[5]. Student re- sponse rate was 88%.  3. INITIAL FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION We predicted that participation in all learning activities  would be positively correlated with student-learning out- comes. However, given the visual nature of the discipline and active learning format, we hypothesized that partic- ipation in image-based learning activities would be more strongly correlated with exam scores than participation in text-based activities. Students reported that with active learning, image-based  activities present less of a cognitive load. Nearly all students (95%) agreed or strongly agreed that LectureTools learning activities were helpful for seeing images of key ideas in the course. Additionally, on a scale of 1 to 8, with one cor- responding to easy and 8 corresponding to demanding mental activity, students rated image-based activities as 4.14 (SD=1.83) and text-based activities as 4.78 (SD=1.81), a statistically significant difference (p<0.0001). Linear regressions suggest that participation in both text-  based (r=0.46) and image-based (r=0.47) in-class activities are correlated with performance on associated exam ques- tions (p<.0001). However, when GPA is taken into account using multivariate regression, participation on text-based questions is no longer significantly correlated with exam grade (Table 1), indicating that higher performing students  Table 1: Regression model predicting exam perfor- mance with in-class participation and demographic variables.

This is not the case for image-based questions, in- dicating that participation in image-based in-class questions raises exam scores.  The active learning classroom is an ideal setting for ad- vancing our understanding of how text-based and image- based materials support student learning. In the active learning setting, students have more time to process infor- mation, thus reducing cognitive load and potentially increas- ing deeper learning, particularly with image-based activities.  4.
