ABSTRACT 

Prior research offers evidence that differing levels of student 

engagement are associated with different outcomes in terms of 

performance. In this study, we investigating the efficacy of a model 

of behavioural and agentic engagement to predict student 

performance (low, middle, high) at four timepoints in a semester. 

The model was significant at all four timepoints. Measures of 

behavioural and agentic engagement predicted membership across 

the three groups differently. With a few exceptions, these 

differences were consistent across timepoints. Looking at 

variations in student engagement across time can be used to target 

interventions to support student success at the undergraduate level.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Prior research suggests that by examining differences in 

student engagement we can better understand differences 

in student achievement [2]. Four dimensions of student 

engagement have been identified: behavioural, emotional, 

cognitive, and agentic [2][5]. Behavioural engagement (baseline 

participation) and agentic engagement (participation extending 

beyond what is expected) are positively related to performance [5]. 

However, student engagement on these dimensions is likely to 

fluctuate across time and individuals. Measures of student 

engagement are still developing [6] and there is a lack of research 

examining differences in student engagement across time.  

Recently, the learning analytics literature has used measures of 

student engagement to predict and investigate student success [4]. 

This type of prediction often has a negative flavour; models have 

typically focused on predicting students at risk for course failure or 

attrition [3]. While this type of prediction is vital, it largely ignores 

a large subset of students: students who fail to be identified as either 

successful or failures. These students may not be at immediate 

academic risk, but may at increased risk for academic failure or 

attrition later in their academic careers [1].  

In a prior investigation of student engagement in a learning-to-learn 

course, we found that despite high and middle performing students 

evidencing similar levels of behavioural engagement, high 

performing students evidenced more agentic engagement [Davis, 

Edwards, Hadwin, & Milford, personal communication]. The 

current study extends findings by investigating the efficacy of a 

model of behavioural and agentic engagement at four different 

timepoints in the semester to predict student performance.  

2. METHOD 
2.1 Research Question 
How do measures of behavioural and agentic engagement predict 

students’ final course grade at four different timepoints during the 

semester? 

2.2 Context 
The study took place within a semester-long elective course, 

comprised of 52% first-year students (N=139), where students 

learned about self-regulated learning and how to apply it to their 

other courses.   Students were enrolled in at least one other 

academic course concurrently. Each week there was one 90-minute 

lecture and one 90-minute lab in which students applied lecture 

material.  Other topics covered in the course included 

procrastination, motivation and emotion, time management, test 

anxiety, and collaboration.  

2.3 Measures 
Measures used for this study were measures of academic history, a 

prior knowledge (PK) survey and incoming semester GPA (GPA); 

measures of behaviour engagement, the number of lecture synthesis 

activities completed (LS) and the number of MyPlanners completed 

(MP); and a measure of agentic engagement, the number of days 

viewed course (Days). Measures are detailed in table 1.

2.4 Procedures 
All measures were (a) completed online as a part of the lecture, lab, 

or homework, (b) collected from institutional data, or (c) logged by 

the course management system. None of the measures directly 

contributed to the overall course grade.           

2.5 Performance Groups 
Data revealed a trimodal distribution of final course grades. 

Students were divided into three groups, consistent with three 

modes for the final grades: (a) low—students at risk of failing (F to 

C +, N=59), (b) middle—students performing adequately (B- to 

B+, N=36), and (c) high—students excelling (A- to A+, N=44). 

3. PREDICTIVE MODEL 
3.1 Model 
Multinomial logistic regressions were performed to predict 

performance group membership (low, middle, and high) at four 

timepoints in the semester, weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Five predictor 

variables were included in the model, see table 1, and were selected 

for this model because they contributed significantly to the binary 

logistic regression models from our previous investigation [Davis, 

Edwards, Hadwin, & Milford, personal communication]. All five 

variables correlated with group membership between >0.2 and 

<0.8. The referent group was the low performance group. 

3.2 Results 
All models were significant at p<0.05, see table 2. The strength of 

the relationship between predictor variables and performance group 

was relatively strong with Nagelkerke’s R2 between 0.54 and 0.65.

All predictor variables contributed significantly to the model at 

least one time point. The measure of agentic engagement, days 

viewed course, (a) predicted group membership at all four 

timepoints when comparing middle-high and (b) at the final three 

timepoints when comparing low-high, but (c) did not predict group 

membership at any timepoints when comparing low-middle. One 

measure of behavioural engagement, lecture synthesis, (a) 

predicted group membership at all four timepoints when comparing 

low-middle and low-high, but (b) did not predict group membership 

at any timepoints when comparing middle-high. The other measure 

of behavioural engagement, MyPlanner, (a) did not predict group 

membership at any timepoint when comparing low-middle or 

middle-high, but (b) did predict group membership at week 9 when 

comparing low-high. 

4. CONCLUSIONS  
We expected more differences across the four timepoints between 

the groups.  The measure of agentic engagement, days viewed 

course, and one measure of behavioural engagement, lecture 

synthesis, differed among students in the three performance groups 

and these differences generally stayed consistent. The other 

measure of behavioural engagement, MyPlanner, did not contribute 

to the model. Further investigation of this variable is warranted.  

Examining engagement in a self-regulated learning course through 

learning analytics is important because it is a context where 

students actively modify their study strategies and metacognitive 

awareness of academic tasks. Middle group students appeared to be 

behaviourally engaged but did not evidence the same levels of 

agentic engagement seen in the high group. To promote student 

success in already behaviourally engaged middle group students, 

they should be encouraged to adapt their agentic engagement.
