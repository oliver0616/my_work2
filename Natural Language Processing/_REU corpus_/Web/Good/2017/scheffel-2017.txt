ABSTRACT
The collaborative learning processes of students in online
learning environments can be supported by providing learn-
ing analytics-based visualisations that foster awareness and
reflection about an individual’s as well as the team’s be-
haviour and their learning and collaboration processes. For
this empirical study we implemented an activity widget into
the online learning environment of a live five-months Master
course and investigated the predictive power of the widget
indicators towards the students’ grades and compared the re-
sults to those from an exploratory study with data collected
in previous runs of the same course where the widget had
not been in use. Together with information gathered from
a quantitative as well as a qualitative evaluation of the ac-
tivity widget during the course, the findings of this current
study show that there are indeed predictive relations be-
tween the widget indicators and the grades, especially those
regarding responsiveness, and indicate that some of the ob-
served differences in the last run could be attributed to the
implemented activity widget.

1. INTRODUCTION
One way to support the collaborative learning processes

of student teams in virtual learning environments is to pro-
vide explicit information to the students about the activities
of the group members and to stimulate awareness, reflec-
tion and social interaction [11]. Although using behavioural
data automatically collected from the learning environment
is not to be seen as a one-to-one replacement for using sub-
jective data collected via questionnaires or interviews [8],
making use of learning analytics based on interaction data
does have the advantage of being non-disruptive and cov-
ering the whole student population of a course. A learn-
ing analytics widget in a computer-supported collaborative
learning environment can thus provide feedback [9, 14] to
students as well as teachers by visualising the students’ ac-
tivities within the virtual learning environment in order to
facilitate awareness and reflection[15].

Endsley [5, 6] describes being aware of one’s own situa-
tion as a three level process: (i) perceiving the elements in
the current situation, (ii) comprehending the situation, and
(iii) projecting what a future status could look like. Once
awareness of the situation is established, a user can reflect
on it in relation to his behaviour [19] and can subsequently
adapt or even change his behaviour if necessary. Accord-
ing to McAlpine & Weston [13] reflection is to be seen as
a mechanism that can improve teaching and thus maximise
learning and not as an end in itself. Reflection processes
and behavioural change are, however, not only influenced by
awareness [2]. Whenever someone engages in self-regulated
learning, they bring their own knowledge, beliefs and skills
into the process [23]. Additionally, emotions, the social envi-
ronment as well as one’s own behaviour play a role [25]. The
way in which someone acts and reacts in a given situation
thus depends on the different ways they have constructed
their current knowledge [24].



The relevance of these aspects has been emphasised by
Verbert et al. [22] in their process model for learning ana-
lytics applications that consists of four stages: awareness, re-
flection, sensemaking, and impact. As the discussion about
the effect of learning analytics and the need for empirical
studies has increased [20, 7], a number of recent studies have
investigated the impact of learning analytics dashboards on
different aspects, e.g. individual goal attainment and mo-
tivation. Lonn et al. [12] investigated whether the motiva-
tion of students in a summer bridge program, i.e. students
among the at-risk population in postsecondary education,
was affected by the use of learning analytics. Their findings
suggest that being exposed to a learning analytics applica-
tion displaying their academic performance can negatively
predict the change of mastery orientation, i.e. it decreases,
and can thus affect a student’s interpretation of their data
and their success. The authors stress that student goal per-
ception and formative performance thus need to be carefully
considered when designing learning analytics interventions.

Beheshitha et al. [1] also examined the effect of learn-
ing analytics visualisations. Their experiment took place in
a blended course setting where each student was randomly
assigned to one of three available visualisations. The results
revealed that the visualisations had different, i.e. positive or
negative, effects on the quality and quantity of forum posts
by the students that depended on the students’ achievement
goal orientation. These authors stress that it is important
to consider individual differences such as achievement goal
orientation in the design process of learning analytics visuali-
sations. A third study by Khan and Pardo [10] showed that
students use learning analytics differently, i.e. depending
on their information need or the learning activity or phase.
All three of these studies clearly emphasise that for learn-
ing analytics visualisations to have a positive effect, they
need to be embedded into the instructional design and that
the students’ personal preferences, e.g. goal attainment or
motivation, need to be considered.

In order to add further results to the collection of empirical
data studies, we have designed a learning analytics widget
called ‘activity widget’ and implemented it into the learning
environment of the European Virtual Seminar (EVS), an
online course where geographically dispersed students work
together on different topics in small teams. Based on data
automatically collected in the EVS platform, the activity
widget is made up of several radar and bar charts. The
aim is to make students aware of the platform activity of
their team in relation to their own activity level. Apart
from making students aware, the activity widget also aims
to foster reflection about how their behaviour can influence
their position in the team and their course outcome.

1.1 Exploratory Offline Study
In a previous exploratory data study [17] (referred to as

‘exploratory study’ throughout this paper) we investigated
the predictive power of several indicators of the activity wid-
get towards the students’ grades by instantiating these in-
dicators with data from the four previous runs (2011-2012,
2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015) of the European Vir-
tual Seminar on Sustainable Development (EVS). That is,
although the activity widget had not been used in those
years, we analysed the log data from these years to explore
what the widget indicator scores would have been if the
widget had been used in those years. We tested whether

the students’ activity scores of the previous runs correlated
with the tutor gradings and whether they validly reflected
them. We did so for the whole run of the courses as well as
for individual months.

More specifically, in the exploratory study we wanted to
know (1) whether the widget indicator scores correlated with
the tutor gradings of individual students at all, (2) whether
the scores of some widget indicators were better predictors
for the students’ individual grades and (3) whether certain
points in time produced indicator scores that are better
grade predictors than others. We hypothesised that signifi-
cant positive correlations existed between the widget indica-
tors and the grades, that the widget indicator ‘presence’ (see
explanation below) was a better predictor than the other
ones and that the widget indicator scores produced in the
second half of the course were better predictors towards the
grades than those in the first half of the course.

The results of the correlation analysis and the structural
equation modelling (SEM) of the exploratory study showed
that most of the indicators indeed significantly and posi-
tively correlated with the grades and that they can be used
as predictors. The scores of the ‘presence’ indicator, how-
ever, did not turn out to be better predictors for the grades,
neither for the whole run nor for the individual months.
Instead, the ‘responsiveness’ indicator achieved the best re-
sults. Looking at the individual months, the analysis showed
that the months in the first half of the course yielded better
correlation and SEM results than those in the second half.
This unexpected outcome was due to an unforeseen large
usage of communication tools outside of the course’s learn-
ing environment. For detailed results and their discussion
please refer to [17].

1.2 Approach
Keeping these results in mind, we implemented the acti-

vity widget into the learning environment of EVS and made
it available to students and tutors in the 2015-2016 run of the
course. In this current study (referred to as ‘online study’
throughout this paper) we investigated whether using the ac-
tivity widget live in a run of the course yielded similar or dif-
ferent correlations between the widget indicator scores and
the grades and whether the regression analyses performed in
SEM showed approximately the same path-coefficients when
compared to the exploratory study. The same set of analy-
ses as used in the exploratory study was therefore applied
to the data from the 2015-2016 run. The research questions
that guided the correlation and regression analyses in our
online study are:

RQ-A1: With the activity widget in use, do widget indica-
tor scores again correlate significantly and positively
with the tutors’ gradings of individual students?

RQ-A2: With the activity widget in use, are the scores
of the responsiveness indicator again better predictors
for the students’ individual grades than those of the
others?

RQ-A3: With the activity widget in use, are the widget
indicator scores produced in the first half of the course
again better predictors than those produced in the sec-
ond half?

As the activity widget aims at making students aware of
their own activities relative to those of their fellow students



as well as fostering reflection about how their behaviour in-
fluences their position within the team and the team’s col-
laboration processes, we were interested in the users’ ex-
perience with the widget during the 2015-2016 run. We
therefore evaluated the activity widget using the Evalua-
tion Framework for Learning Analytics (EFLA) question-
naire twice: the first evaluation was conducted in the middle
of the course and the second one at the end. Using EFLA
allowed us to take the students’ as well as the tutors’ points
of view into account and to compare the two user groups
with one another. The research questions that guided the
widget evaluation are:

RQ-B1: Is there a difference in widget evaluation results
between the mid-course questionnaire and the end-
course questionnaire?

RQ-B2: Is there a difference in widget evaluation results
between students and tutors?

The next section describes the course, the activity widget
and the evaluation questionnaire in more detail and also
elaborates on the method of analysis. After that, we present
the results of our online study followed by a discussion and
the conclusions.

2. METHOD

2.1 Participants and Materials

2.1.1 The EVS Course
Coordinated by the Open University of the Netherlands,

the European Virtual Seminar on Sustainable Development
(EVS) is a web-based Master course jointly offered by ap-
proximately ten different universities in Europe each year,
some of which are campus universities while others are dis-
tance education institutions. An extensive description of
EVS1 and its aims is provided in [3].

EVS runs for five months (November 1 till April 1) every
year. During that time students work together on sustain-
ability issues in teams of four to seven, with about six to
nine teams every year. Ages range between 20 and 25 years
for the students from the regular universities and between
30 and 50 years for those from the distance universities. Ev-
ery team is coached by a tutor and guided by an expert on
the team’s topic.

The students’ final grade for the course can range from
0 to 10 and is comprised of several components: 50% are
based on the grade for a team’s research report which is
given by the expert; 20% are based on the grade for a team’s
collaboration process which is given by the tutor; 30% are
based on the grade for the individual student’s contribution
which is also given by the tutor. This last grade is called
the ‘individual-overall’ grade (T4) and is divided into three
subgrades: ‘T1 planning & progress’, ‘T2 contribution to
team’ and ‘T3 support’. These four grades evaluating an
individual student’s contribution are the ones used in our
analyses. Table 1 explains the different aspects covered by
these grades.

Since the run of 2011-2012 EVS has been using an Elgg-
based2 platform which automatically collects and generates

2https://elgg.org/

data on the students’ activities on the platform. This data
forms the input to our awareness widget.

2.1.2 The Activity Widget
We developed the widget as an Elgg environment plug-

in. It can be downloaded under the GNU GPL version 2
[21]. The widget is meant to make students aware of their
activities on the platform in relation to those of their team
members and to then reflect on this information. It also
allows the tutors to become aware of the different activity
levels of the students in their team. There are five indica-
tors representing different types of activities on the platform:
‘W1 initiative’, ‘W2 responsiveness’, ‘W3 presence, ‘W4 con-
nectedness’ and ‘W5 productivity’. Table 2 explains how the
scores of the different widget indicators are calculated.

There are two different views available in the activity wid-
get: one showing the widget indicator scores for the whole
run of EVS (see Figure 1) and one showing them per month
(see Figure 2). The widget indicator scores are automati-
cally calculated from the data recorded in the EVS platform
and are scaled from 0 to 10. The team member with the
highest activity gets a score of 10 for that widget indicator
and the scores of the other team members are then scaled
in relation to that. In both views, the team average scores
are shown in blue while the current user’s scores are shown
in orange.

As showing a student’s widget indicator scores to the other
team members is a privacy sensitive issue, we followed the
process suggested by Drachsler and Greller’s DELICATE
checklist [4] and created a manual explaining the widget’s
intentions and functionalities. It was distributed to all EVS
users making clear what data is collected, how it is visualised
and how they can protect their privacy. Implemented within
the widget is a Reciprocal Privacy Model (RPM) that allows
students to decide whether their team members can see their
widget indicator scores or not. Those students that share
their data get to see the data from those who also decided
to share theirs. Those students that do not want to share
their data do not get to see their team members’ data. The
team average is visible to all students all the time.

2.1.3 The Evaluation Framework for Learning Ana-
lytics

The added value of providing learning analytics to stu-
dents and teachers has clearly been recognised in many edu-

cational institutions. While new widgets and dashboards are
continuously being developed and implemented, their evalu-
ation has not been standardised yet. We thus developed the
Evaluation Framework for Learning Analytics (EFLA)3 that
can be used to evaluate learning analytics tools according to
several aspects.

The first version of the EFLA was developed with experts
from the learning analytics community using a group con-
cept mapping study [18]. It consisted of five criteria (‘Ob-
jectives’, ‘Learning Support’, ‘Learning Measures and Out-
put’, ‘Data Aspects’ and ‘Organisational Aspects’) with four
items each. In a follow-up study [16], this first version of the
EFLA was evaluated by a small group of learning analytics
experts. Based on the results of this evaluation combined
with a revisit of the original group concept mapping data
as well as a thorough look at related literature, a second
version of the EFLA was developed. This version is split in
two parts, one for learners and one for teachers, that both
consist of four criteria (‘Data Aspects’, ‘Awareness’, ‘Reflec-
tion’ and ‘Impact’) with three items each. Table 3 shows the
twelve items of the learner as well as the teacher part of the
framework. This version was turned into an applicable tool,
i.e. a questionnaire for students and teachers, and then used
to evaluate the activity widget in EVS.

2.2 Procedure

2.2.1 Correlation and Regression Analyses
As in our exploratory study, we used the scores of the wid-

get indicators ‘W1 initiative’, ‘W2 responsiveness’ and ‘W3
presence’4 for our analysis. The other two widget indicators
‘W4 connectedness’ and ‘W5 productivity’ were excluded
again for the same reasons as in the previous study (see
[17]).

We first conducted a t-test to see whether the difference
between the widget indicator scores from the online study
and those from the exploratory study were significant or
not. Then, the scores of the three widget indicators (W1,
W2, W3) were correlated with the students’ four individual

were unfortunately not available.



grades given by the tutors (T1, T2, T3, T4) using Spear-
man’s rank correlation. The ranking corrects for differences
in scales and units as well as for differences in grading style
of the tutors.

We also applied structural equation modelling in order to
determine predictive relations between the widget indica-
tors and the grades. Although the data follows a Poisson
distribution because the widget indicators consist of count
variables, we could assume a normal distribution because
most count variable data had a nearly normal distribution
and a mean value far enough from 05. We were thus able to
do the regression analysis.

Spearman’s rank correlations and the t-test were calcu-
lated using IBM’s SPSS Statistics 23 while the regression
analyses were performed in Mplus 7. All calculations were
done for the entire length of the run as well as for the indi-
vidual months.

2.2.2 Widget Evaluation
At the beginning of the course in the fall of 2015, all EVS

users received a course manual that included information
about the activity widget, i.e. its intentions and function-
alities. Two weeks into the course a discussion thread was
opened in EVS offering students the opportunity to ask ques-
tions about the widget and to comment on it. The discussion
thread was kept open and active throughout the course’s
runtime.

In order to apply the EFLA to the activity widget in EVS,
it was turned into a questionnaire. Using online forms, we
created a section for each criterion and its three indicators.
Every indicator could be rated on a scale from 0 to 6. At the
end of the questionnaire, open ended comment boxes were
provided for each section asking the users whether they had
any comments about this section. Two separate question-
naires were created: one for the students and one for the
tutors of EVS.

About halfway through the course, on January 12, 2016,
students as well as tutors were sent an invitation to partici-
pate in the evaluation of the widget by answering the EFLA
questionnaire. They were given ten days to answer. Shortly
before the end of the course, on March 18, 2016, students
and tutors were invited to participate in a second evaluation
round of the widget by answering the EFLA questionnaire
again. They were given a week to answer.

3. RESULTS

3.1 Correlation and Regression Analyses
Looking at the average number of actions per student du-

ring the different months gives us a first impression of the
students’ behaviour of the online study in comparison to
the data from the exploratory study. Figure 3 shows a stu-
dent’s average number of initiative and responsiveness posts
as well as the presence counts per month for the four years of
the exploratory study (2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15)
and the year of the online study (2015-2016) where the acti-
vity widget was in use. While the number of initiative posts
clearly varies a lot between the years, the number of respon-
siveness posts and presence counts are much closer together.

5The mean should be > 10 to be far enough from 0
according to www.umass.edu/wsp/resources/poisson/ and
www.umass.edu/wsp/resources/poisson/poisson1.html and
www.umass.edu/wsp/resources/poisson/poisson2.html.

Figure 3: A student’s average number of actions
for the three widget indicators per month for five
different years.

The most striking difference between the years is that the
course run with the widget (2015-2016) has the fewest ini-
tiative posts (highly significant, P < 0.000) and the most
responsiveness posts (marginally significant, P = 0.053).

The regression analyses were done in two sets: one had
T1, T2 and T3 as the dependent variable while the other
had T4 as the dependent variable due to T4 being a combi-
nation of the other grades. All Root Mean Squared Errors
of Approximation and all Standardised Root Mean Squared
Residuals were equal to 0.0 while all Tucker-Lewis Indices
and all Comparative Fit Indices were equal to 1.0 except
for the CFI of the analysis in month3 between the three

indicators and grade T4 which was equal to 0.0.
In the exploratory study, all grade-indicator combinations

except the one between ‘T1 planning & progress’/‘W3 pres-
ence’ yielded significant and positive correlations when mea-
suring the students’ activity over the entire length of the
run. In the online study, however, ‘W2 responsiveness’ is
the only widget indicator that positively and significantly

correlates with the four grades (see Table 66). All grade-W2
correlations are significant at the 0.01 level and higher than
.500. That is, there are less significant correlations in the
online study than in the exploratory study but those that
are significant are stronger.

When calculating the correlations for the online study per
month instead of the whole run, the results are again quite
different from those in the exploratory study. In the ex-
ploratory study the scores of the indicators ‘W1 initiative’
and ‘W2 responsiveness’ correlated significantly with all four
grades in months 1, 2, 3 and 4 with W2 also significantly
correlating with the grades T2, T3 and T4 in month5. The
indicator ‘W3 presence’ had the smallest number of signifi-
cant correlations with the different grades that were rather
low. The strongest correlations were obtained between W2
and all grades in month2. Looking at the individual month,
the correlation results from the online study with the live
activity widget here also look quite different (see Table 4).
Overall there are now less significant correlations and hardly
any in month1 or month2. The strongest correlation coeffi-
cients (ranging from .571 to .669) are received between the
‘W2 responsiveness’ indicator and the four different grades
in month4 and month5. All of them are significant at the

0.01 level. Additionally, the previously low scoring ‘W3 pres-
ence’ indicator now obtains high and significant correlations
with all four grades in month4 and month5.

Conducting the structural equation modelling over the en-
tire length of the run in the exploratory study showed that
all three widget indicator scores could be used as predictors
for all four grades except the ‘T1 planning & progress’ /
‘W3 presence’ combination. The ‘W2 responsiveness’ was
the strongest and most significant predictor. In our current
online study, there are only three predictive relations (see
Table 6), i.e. the ‘W2 responsiveness’ indicator is a predic-
tor for the grades ‘T2 contribution to the team’, ‘T3 support’
and ‘T4 individual-overall’. None of the other indicators can
be used as predictors.

Comparing the regression analysis results for the individ-
ual months from the exploratory study with the online study
again reveals a number of differences. Previously the ‘W2
responsiveness’ indicator was a predictor for all grades in
all months with month1 and especially month2 providing
the strongest predictive relations. The ‘W1 initiative’ indi-
cator received a predictive relation with all four grades in
month1 and month3 while the ‘W3 presence’ indicator was
negatively predictive for the ‘T1 planning & progress’ grade
only. In the online study, however, the ‘W2 responsiveness’
indicator can only be used as a predictor in month1, month4
and month5 with the latter one holding the strongest pre-
dictive relations (see Table 5). The ‘W1 initiative’ indicator
is in no predictive relation with any of the grades in any of
the months. The widget indicator scores of ‘W3 presence’,
though, are in a significant negative predictive relation with
the grades ‘T2 contribution to the team’ and ‘T4 individual-
overall’ in month2.

3.2 Widget Evaluation
In order to gauge how the learners and tutors of EVS

evaluate their experience with the activity widget, we asked
them to fill out the Evaluation Framework for Learning An-
alytics (EFLA) questionnaire. As we distributed the ques-
tionnaire twice during the course, we are able to compare
not only the two user types with one another but also any
changes in the users’ perception of the activity widget over
time. Figure 4 shows the average scores of the twelve ques-

tionnaire items as well as the combined criteria for both user
types and both rounds.

On average students as well as tutors rated awareness and
reflection items higher than the items of the data and im-
pact criteria. Also, while the students on average rated the
activity widget more positively in the middle of the course,
tutors gave more positive ratings at the end of the course.

Conducting a t-test for the four criteria allowed us to see
whether the differences between the two user types or be-
tween the two rounds were significant or not. Table 8 shows
the mean, standard deviation and standard error mean for
the answers given by students and tutors in rounds 1 and
2. We conducted t-tests for four different settings. First,
we compared the answers from the students to those from
the tutors in round 1 and round 2. We then compared the
answers from round 1 to those from round 2 for each user
group. Table 7 shows the Levene’s test as well as the t-test
results for the four different settings.

There are two cases where the differences in ratings are
significant. The first one is the rating of the awareness
criterion when comparing students and tutors in round 1:
t(28) = 2.158, p = .040. The second one is the rating of the
reflection criterion when comparing round 1 and round 2 of
the students: t(47) = 2.110, p = .040. None of the other
t-tests obtained significant results at the .05 or even the .01
level. In two cases the equality of variance could not be as-
sumed due to the results of the Levene’s test. Both of those
cases involved the ratings for the reflection criterion from the
tutors in round 1, which are rather low, but did not yield
significant t-test results. If the equality of variance had been
assumed for those cases, however, the difference in ratings
between students and tutors for the reflection criterion in
phase 1 would have been highly significant (0.006).

From the open ended questions at the end of each EFLA
questionnaire we were able to gather some qualitative feed-
back about the students’ and tutors’ impression of the acti-
vity widget. Generally most students liked the idea behind
the dashboard and appreciated to see their platform acti-
vities being set in relation to those of their team members.
Many students, however, mentioned several issues they were
concerned about: The activity widget was not able to reflect
activities outside the platform nor did it take the quality of

the posts into account. Some students complained that they
noticed people posting irrelevant things in order to achieve
higher scores. Some students, though, were made aware that
they indeed did less than their team mates and thus partic-
ipated more in the group.

The tutors also expressed their appreciation of the activity
widget in the open ended comments and generally liked hav-
ing the widget as a reference. For most of them, the activity
widget confirmed their own impression about their students
throughout the course. With regard to the widget fostering
reflection about their own tutoring style it was mentioned
that such support would be especially useful in those cases
where the student groups do not work together well as the
tutors could then use the widget to detect such issues early
on. One concern the tutors also had was that the activity
widget only reflects actions within the EVS platform and
that any work the students do with other online tools is not
included.

4. DISCUSSION
When student activity is calculated over the whole run of

the course, the Spearman correlation results show that in
the online study the scores of the ‘W2 responsiveness’ in-
dicator correlate significantly and positively with the four
grades. Research question A1 can thus be answered with a
‘yes’. However, while in the exploratory study the scores of
all three widget indicators correlated significantly and posi-
tively with at least three if not all four of the grades, in the
online study only ‘W2 responsiveness’ did. But although
there are now less correlations that are significant, those
that are significant are very strong. Regarding the increase
of strength of the Spearman correlation results in our online
study, similar results are achieved when calculating the acti-
vity for the individual months instead of over the whole run
of the course. In comparison to the exploratory study, there
are also less correlations that are significant in the individual
months but those that are significant are very strong.

Going into the online study, we had expected something

like this to happen. Of the three indicators analysed, ‘W2 re-
sponsiveness’, i.e. commenting on the posts, pages or files of
others, is the one that best represents team interaction and
collaboration. With the activity widget in use during the
course, we expected it to foster the students’ awareness and
reflection about their position within the team and the team
as a whole and to thus facilitate collaboration processes.

The standardised path coefficients from the structural equa-
tion modelling (see Tables 5 and 6) show that there are
indeed significant predictive relations between some of the
widget indicator scores and the grades. As with the correla-
tion coefficients, only the ‘W2 responsiveness’ scores receive
significant results when looking at the entire length of the
run. Slightly more diverse results become apparent when
looking at the standardised path coefficients for the differ-
ent months, e.g. in month2 the score of the ‘W3 presence’
indicator can also be seen as a predictor for some of the
grades. However, the best and by far the most frequent
predictor for all four grades are the scores from the ‘W2 re-
sponsiveness’ indicator. Research question A2 can thus also
be answered with a ‘yes’. Since the ‘W2 responsiveness’ in-
dicator scores, although surprisingly at the time, had been
by far the best predictor in the exploratory study and since
we had anticipated an increase of team interactions due to
the widget triggering awareness and reflection processes, we
had expected this indicator to be the best overall predictor
in the online study as well.

What surprised us, however, was that in the online study
none of the predictive relations involved the ‘W1 initiative’
indicator. As presented earlier, the 2015-2016 run had a
significantly lower number of initiative posts per student.
When looking into the log data from this year it became
apparent that the number of posted files (which is by far the
major contributor to the initiative score) was lower during
the year of the online study. This may be explained by an
increased use of external tools already from early on in the
course which cannot be logged and was thus not included in
the calculation of the widget indicator scores.

During the exploratory study this use of external tools,
especially during the second half of the course where the
different group reports needed to be written, turned out to
be the most likely explanation for the widget indicators of
the first half of the course to be better predictors than those
of the second half. As the students in the online study also
made use of such external tools, we expected the same to be
true for the 2015-2016 run even though the widget was now
in use. However, research question A3 has to be answered
with a ‘no’ as the strongest correlations and best predictive
relations are now more likely to happen towards the end of
the course.

This shift to the last few months now being the main
source for widget scores with predictive power is already in-



dicated by the correlation results: all grade / W2 as well
as all grade / W3 combinations in month4 and month5 are
significantly and positively correlated with correlation co-
efficients ranging from .365 to .669. Month2 and month3
do not show any significant correlations in the online study
whereas they did so for many grade / widget indicator com-
binations in the exploratory study. With regard to predic-
tive relations, while none of the widget indicator scores from
month3 can be used as a predictor for any of the grades,
there are two predictors in month2: The scores of the ‘W3
presence’ indicator are in a significant negative predictive
relation with the grades ‘T2 contribution to team’ and ‘T4
individual-overall’. With regard to the best predictor, the
results of the regression analysis in the online study confirm
the afore mentioned shift and show that for three grades
the best predictors are the scores of the ‘W2 responsive-
ness’ indicator in month5, except the grade ‘T1 planning &
progress’ that is best predicted by the ‘W2 responsiveness’
indicator score in month1.

In the previous years, the widget indicator scores in the
last months were poor predictors of the grades, which we
attributed to the students mostly using non-logged external
tools in this period. In the online study, the widget indica-
tor scores in the last months were the best predictors of the
grades. We can think of two probable causes of this shift.
First, students that were initially less active may have been
stimulated by widget feedback to become more active, re-
sulting in better grades. Second, students, aware that their
activities with the external tools were not captured by the
activity widget, posted more frequently on the EVS plat-
form as they wanted the widget to reflect their being active
in the course.

Another surprising observation for us was the students’
neglect of the privacy protection option through the recip-
rocal privacy model. None of the students disabled this func-
tionality to mask their data from their team. This could be
due to the nature of the collaborative learning process that
requires to be aware of the status of other students. In fact,
we received generally positive responses from the students
about the activity widget and that it indeed supported their
team awareness processes as well as added a ‘fun factor’ to
the online learning environment.

The results of the formal evaluation of the activity wid-
get using the EFLA questionnaire show that the answer to
research question B1 is ‘yes, but for the students’ reflection
criterion only’ as their reflection ratings in round 2 were sig-
nificantly lower than those in round 1. In all other cases,
neither for the students nor the tutors was there a signifi-
cant difference in evaluation results between the two rounds.
From what we were able to gather from the open ended ques-
tions as well as the discussion thread, this difference was
most likely due to the students feeling less accurately repre-
sented the more the course progressed as the activities of the
external tools was not reflected in the widget scores. When
comparing the evaluation results from the two user groups
with one another, the only significant difference is that of the
awareness criterion in round 1. Here, students have rated
the awareness items significantly higher than the tutors did.
In all other cases, neither in round 1 nor in round 2 was
there a significant difference in evaluation results between
the two user groups. Research question B2 can therefore be
answered with ‘yes, but for the awareness criterion of phase
1 only’. This is most likely due to the generally positive

reception of the activity widget by students already at the
beginning of the course while tutors used and thus appreci-
ated the widget more towards the end of the course when
they saw their personal impressions about the students con-
firmed. Except for those two cases, students and tutors thus
evaluated the activity widget in a very similar way.

Combining the EFLA results with the comments gathered
via the open ended questions allows us to conclude that both
students and teachers generally liked and appreciated the
activity widget and felt supported in their awareness and
reflection processes. Both user groups, however, had issues
with the widget’s data access (D2) as well as its support
of more efficient (I2) and more effective (I3) learning. Ad-
ditionally, both user groups found it problematic that the
activity from external tools could not be included in the
widget. Students would also like to see not only the quan-
tity but also the quality of their discussion posts to be taken
into account as they otherwise fear that too many irrelevant
message are posted to increase the widget indicator score.

We had already identified the risk of students ‘playing the
system’ during our exploratory study and had thus provided
a detailed user manual at the beginning of the 2015-2016
course explaining the activity widget’s aim and function-
alities. This, although being an important step, however,
does not seem to have been enough. As emphasised in other
studies [12, 1, 10] learning analytics visualisations need to
be tightly embedded into a course’s instructional design, es-
pecially if they are to be used by the students themselves.
For the next run of EVS we will therefore carefully take the
gathered results into account in order to improve the activity
widget as well as the instructional design and to enhance the
user experience.

There are several limitations of our study. Due to the
change in student population, the students’ behaviour in the
five different runs cannot be set into a one-to-one relation.
Their previous experience with and usage of online learning
platforms as well as external communication and collabora-
tion tools influences the cohort’s actions. The same applies
to the tutors. Although many of them have been tutors for
EVS for a number of years, their experience and interac-
tions with their student groups also changes from year to
year. Related to this aspect of change in student popula-
tion, student and tutor behaviour as well as external tools
is another aspect that has to be kept in mind when looking
at the results of our online study: although a number of our
observations can be explained as effects of the activity wid-
get being in use, there is no proof that this is the case. Only
after observing and analysing further years of the EVS will
we be able to attribute differences between the years that
did not have the widget and those that did clearly to the
use of the widget.

5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presented an empirical study conducted with

data collected during the five months of a live Master course
where students work collaboratively in virtual teams. We
implemented a learning analytics-based activity widget to
foster awareness and reflection among the team members
into the course’s online learning platform and examined the
predictive power of the widget indicators towards the stu-
dents’ grades of this course in comparison to the data from
previous years where the widget had not been in use. Our re-
sults indicate that the widget indicator ‘responsiveness’, i.e.



the number of response posts made on the course’s platform,
is a significant positive predictor towards the grades. In the
years without the widget, the students’ behaviour of the
first few months of the course held more predictive power,
whereas in the year where the widget was implemented into
the platform, the last few months of the course had a higher
predictive potential. This, in combination with the results
from a quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation of the
activity widget during the course, suggests that the differ-
ences between the years could be explained by the use of the
widget and its effective fostering of awareness and reflection.
More investigations are needed in order to provide further
evidence that can substantiate this hypothesis and confirm
the effectiveness of the widget. We will therefore continue to
deploy the activity widget in future editions of the course.
