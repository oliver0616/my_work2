ABSTRACT
Government and institutionally-driven reforms focused on quality 
teaching and learning in universities emphasize the importance of 
developing replicable, scalable teaching approaches that can be 
evaluated. In this context, learning design and learning analytics 
are two fields of research that may help university teachers design 
quality learning experiences for their students, evaluate how 
students are learning within that intended learning context and 
support personalized learning experiences for students.  Learning 
Designs are ways of describing an educational experience such 
that it can be applied across a range of disciplinary contexts.  
Learning analytics offers new approaches to investigating the data 
associated with a learner’s experience. This paper explores the 
relationship between learning designs and learning analytics.

1. INTRODUCTION
Within the higher education sector internationally there is 
mounting interest in developing replicable and scalable exemplars 
and templates of effective teaching practice. This, in part, has 
arisen from increased accountability and quality assurance 
expectations in terms of the demonstration of teaching quality. 
Bodies such as the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher 
Education (QAA) in the UK and the Australian Universities 
Quality Agency (AUQA) in Australia have been charged 
assessing and reporting on the quality of the education and 
student services that are provided by the higher education 
institutions in their countries.
Whether driven by national accountability expectations or 
institutional initiatives to support quality, the field of learning 
design has received much attention in the education sphere.  This 

interest may be due to the perceived potential for learning designs 
to address concerns about quality. Learning designs, (or as they 
may be termed pedagogical models or pedagogical patterns) are 
representations of teaching practice.  Learning designs articulate a 
sequence of learning activities, what resources are used by 
learners engaged in those activities, and how the teacher or others 
participants in the experience supports the learning activities.  A 
learning design can act as a model or template that teachers may 
replicate across a range of educational contexts. In essence, 
learning designs help frame the intent of and process for the 
pedagogical experience.
Learning design research and its up-take in educational practice 
has come in many forms.  At its basis is the concept that it is 
important to describe an educational experience in such a way 
that it can be replicated then applied across a range of disciplinary 
contexts.  Essentially, the focus is on the design and planning of 
the educational experience.  In practice, learning designs are 
predominately directed at the designer/teacher of the educational 
experience.  Learning designs provide a way for a teacher to 
document their pedagogical intent.  When shared amongst 
teachers, learning designs provide stimulus or guidance for other 
teachers to design quality educational experiences.  
Learning analytics, on the other hand, are largely directed at the 
student.  In essence learning analytics allow us to use the data 
associated with a learner’s interactions to make pedagogically 
informed decisions and evaluations. Learning analytics as an 
emerging interdisciplinary field draws upon and integrates 
research related to data mining, social networks, data 
visualisation, machine learning, semantics, e-learning and 
educational theory and practice.  Seemingly, learning analytics 
takes up where learning design finishes in the educational 
experience continuum – implementation and outcomes. 
This paper explores the relationship between learning design and 
learning analytic approaches.  The paper considers the context in 
which learning design research emerged and highlights one strand 
of its development in Australia as a way of consider how it may 
be compatible with learning analytics.  It also considers work in 
social network analysis as an example subset of learning analytics 
to demonstrate how this field complements learning design.

2. BACKGROUND
Although the terminology and the scope of research and 
application of both learning design and learning analytics 
approaches have evolved in recent years, their underlying basis is 
not new. Essentially these research fields are concerned with 
documenting and reporting on educational practice and 
experience.  The interest in both learning designs and learning 
analytics has gained momentum within the context of two 
compatible worldwide trends within the higher education 
environment – calls for improved teaching and increasing use of

technology.  In the early 90s, commentators and policymakers 
began to argue for increased expectations of the quality of the 
teaching that was delivered in universities, and accountability for 
that quality[1].  This was met, in many countries around the 
world, with a wave of professional development programs aimed 
to improve the quality of teaching and funding for ‘innovation’ in 
teaching (such as the Australian Learning and Teaching Council, 
Higher Education Funding Council for England).
Soon after this focus on quality teaching began, the increasingly 
accessible and user-friendly Web provided universities with an 
opportunity to expand their student markets and offer flexible 
forms of programs.  There was increasing expectations for, and 
interest among, university teachers to integrate technology within 
their teaching practice.   From those early days of the Web, 
research and teaching scholarship explored the opportunities that 
technology provided education – particularly in terms of 
improving pedagogy [2].  The increasing emphasis on and 
expectations towards technology integration created complexity 
within the teaching environment in terms of its design, 
implementation and evaluation process.  As a result, professional 
development and teaching innovation funding was directed at 
projects aimed at improving teaching using technology.  
Underlying the support for such projects was the premise that the 
project outcomes, resources and products would be disseminated 
amongst the higher education community and adopted at the 
institutional and individual teacher levels.  The emergence and 
subsequent developments in the area of learning designs 
exemplify these principles of resource creation, sharing and reuse 
that were at the heart of this higher education funding. 

2.1 Research in Learning Designs 
For over a decade now, researchers around the world, have been 
interested in the educational and technical issues associated with 
how teachers and instructional designers could create document, 
share, adapt and implement, educational design ideas.   This 
involved developing a technical language (IMS LD [3]), 
developing tools in which learning designs could be created 
and/or used [4, 5], and investigating how teachers interpret and 
use different learning design representations [6, 7].  
In Australia, learning designs first emerged through a project 
funded by then Australian Universities Teaching Committee.  
Initiated in 2000, entitled Information and Communication 
Technologies and Their Role in Flexible Learning, the project 
established a framework for evaluating high quality learning in 
higher education [8], identified and evaluated educational 
examples against the framework, documented these as exemplars 
and generic learning designs, and disseminated these through the 
project website (http://www.learningdesigns.uow.edu.au/).  These 
initial resources were termed “learning designs” and comprised a 
visual representation with supporting textual descriptions (see 
Figure 1 for example) [9]. 

Figure 1. Example learning design from 
http://learningdesigns.uow.edu.au

The visual representation depicted a sequence of tasks that 
learners engage in as rectangles in the centre of the diagram.  
Resources (e.g., readings or equipment) that are required for each 
learning task are represented as triangles to the left of relevant 
tasks and the supports that teachers or other participants provide 
(e.g., facilitating a discussion, peer-feedback) are represented as 
circles to the right of relevant tasks.  The supporting textual 
description allows teachers to identify intended learning outcomes 
of the design and provide more fulsome guidance on each 
component (tasks, resources, and supports) within the design.
The exemplar and generic learning designs developed through this 
Australian project have been the basis of a number of subsequent 
research studies.  The learning design framework has been found 
to be useful as method for teachers to interpret and then apply the 
ideas in the design of their own teaching [10] and as a tool that 
that allows extraction of teaching and learning processes for 
analysis [11]. The learning design framework has proven to be 
useful for teacher interested in how to integrate learning objects 
into their teaching – where learning objects are consider the 
‘resources’ within the learning designs [12]. In researching their 
dissemination, these learning designs have been reportedly used 
by staff in educational development units and individual 
university teachers to support the process for designing courses 
and also as a way of reflecting on the implementation once a 
course has been delivered [13].  
Compatible frameworks have been researched yielding similar 
results.  Some approaches are a simple as the use of a concept 
map to identify and link key learning components [6].  The more 
complex pedagogical patterns approach, developed from the 
architectural frame, has shown promise for articulating 
collaboration focused teaching and learning and incorporating 
open educational resources (or learning objects) [14]. 
This combined work suggests that a learning design framework of 
some sort is a useful mechanism to support the design and 
planning aspect of the educational experience and also as a way 
of sharing and stimulating educational ideas amongst university 
teachers.  Thus, this research basis gives us a range of mechanism 
to define pedagogical intent.  The next step in the process is being 
able to understand the process and outcome of these intentions.  
While traditional course assessment provides one mechanism, the

growing availability of data through online education systems 
allows other opportunities. 

3. THE POTENTIAL OF LEARNING 
ANALYTICS
While learning designs may provide theoretical, practice-based, 
and/or evidence-based examples of sound educational design, 
learning analytics allow us to test those assumptions with actual 
student interaction data in lieu of self-report measures such as 
post hoc surveys.  In particular, learning analytics provides us 
with the necessary data and tools to support the accountability 
that has been called for in higher education.
As with learning designs, learning analytics takes a range of 
forms and foci.  One sub-set of the learning analytics domain is 
social network analysis (SNA). SNA provides a way to 
understand the educational experience and outcomes for learners 
engaged in online communication activities.  Much of the 
aforementioned take-up of technology in higher education has 
been the associated with the the discussion forum – particularly 
within learning management system course sites [15, 16].  There 
are countless examples in the literature that describe the design 
and implementation of educational programs that use discussion 
forums.  Where these cases are aligned with a theoretical premise, 
it is of the social cognitive aspect of learning and the benefits of 
collaboration (e.g., [17].  Thus it follows that, social network 
analysis provides a methodology for teachers to begin to 
understand the impact of their implemented learning design on the 
student learning experience and outcomes.  However, this 
analysis needs to be readily accessible and interpretable for all 
educators regardless of expertise in network analyses; information 
and communication technologies or educational theory.  
To address this issue of user uptake and interpretation, Dawson 
[18] and colleagues developed an analytical tool named Social 
Networks Adapting Pedagogical Practice (SNAPP – available at 
http://research.uow.edu.au/learningnetworks/seeing/snapp/index.h
tml).  SNAPP seamlessly integrates with learning management 
system discussion forums to extract data and provide teachers 
with real-time visualizations of the discussion forum activity (see 
figure 2).  Recent evaluations of the use of SNAPP by university 
teachers demonstrated that the tool was seen to be particularly 
effective for retrospective analysis of an education 
implementation after a course was completed [19].  However, 
despite the ease in generating ongoing visualizations of student 
discussion interactions and relationship development, teachers did 
not take the opportunity to analyze data during actual course 
implementation. This process would have allowed for 
modification of the learning design ‘on the fly’ if the intended 
experience or outcomes were not being realized.  While this 
learning analytics tool theoretically supports the implementation 
stage of that educational continuum - to date it has been largely 
used as a reflective tool. Further research is required to investigate 
how educators can be better prompted when student interactions 
indicate a deviation from the intended learning outcomes. For 
example, an educator observes minimal student-to-student 
interactions arising despite the implementation of learning 
activities designed to establish a learning community.

relationships evolving from an online discussion forum

4. THE CHALLENGE 
Essentially, the learning design approach is founded on a case-
based reasoning premise. A documented learning design provides 
a case that is abstract enough such that teachers can imagine how 
it might be applied to their own context.  However, investigation 
of the use of learning designs suggests that teachers also benefit 
from understanding the context of others and the environments in 
which they teach and thus cases should not be so abstract as to 
lose a connection with the original context [20].    Regardless of 
the level of abstraction, the notion is that teachers learn or refine 
their ideas about design from the examples of other teachers. 
The dissemination and adoption of innovative teaching ideas in 
higher education – whether those ideas are expressed through 
learning design representations or other types of tools or 
resources, recognizes the social processes of being a teacher.  
University teachers report that their ideas about teaching come 
from interacting with colleagues and other teachers [21, 22]. In 
this context, teachers are less likely to seek information from 
external resources or online sources.  This research (and that of 
others investigating educational change) frequently highlights 
time as a barrier to the adoption of new ideas into ones teaching 
practice.  Academics in higher education institutions are stretched 
across their teaching and research responsibilities.  They are more 
likely to invest time to try new ideas if they are convinced, 
through evidence, that the innovation will have an impact for 
them and their learners that is both time and workload efficient.   
Learning analytics has the potential to provide this evidence.  The 
research challenge is identifying effective and efficient ways to 
make learning design and learning analytics useful and relevant 
for teachers. The integration of research related to both learning 
design and learning analytics provides the necessary contextual 
overlay to better understand observed student behavior and 
provide the necessary pedagogical recommendations where 
learning behavior deviates from pedagogical intention.
