ABSTRACT 
This case study describes how course features and individual & 
social learning analytics were scaled up to support “participatory” 
learning.  An existing online course was turned into a “big open 
online course” (BOOC) offered to hundreds. Compared to typical 
open courses, relatively high levels of persistence, individual & 
social engagement, and achievement were obtained. These results 
suggest that innovative learning analytics might best be scaled (a) 
incrementally, (b) using design-based research methods, (c) 
focusing on engagement in consequential & contextual 
knowledge, (d) using emerging situative assessment theories.

1.  INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT 
This paper introduces an approach to “personalized” learning [22] 
that is rooted in situative views of cognition [3, 7], connectivist 
views of learning [21], and participatory views of online culture 
[18]. The features and learning analytics that define this approach 
were first theorized and then refined informally and intuitively in 
smaller online courses.  They were then scaled up to function 
more systematically and automatically in a “big open online 
course” (“BOOC”).

2.  RESEARCH CONTEXT 
This particular approach to personalized learning is rooted in prior 
design-based studies of educational multimedia [14, 16], 
educational videogames [1] and English language instruction [13]. 
This prior research resulted in a general set of design principles 
and “local” theories [4] for enacting them.  Starring in 2008, these 
ideas were used to design and refine two online graduate level 
courses: Learning & Cognition in Schools and Assessment in 
Education.  Both courses served students with very diverse 
experiences & ambitions; both courses brought with them detailed 
expectations for disciplinary content coverage. 

These refinements resulted in a set of participatory design 
principles for fostering productive forms of individual and social 
engagement in disciplinary knowledge [5] while also consistently 
impacting individual understanding (as assessed with classroom 
performance assessments) and aggregated achievement (as 
measured with conventional tests).  The courses were organized 
around “wikifolios” that every learner could see and comment on.  
Both courses were organized around texts that were challenging 
for less-experienced learners. The first author taught each course 
online at least once per year using the Sakai CMS. These features 
and analytics (a) were reasonably efficient with up to 30 students, 
(b) supported extensive levels of individual and shared 
disciplinary engagement, (c) generated enduring understanding of 
targeted course concepts, and (d) resulted in significant and 
substantial gains in student achievement [15].   

The Assessment course was scaled up to a 12-week open course 
using Google Course Builder (Version 1.4) starting September 
2013. The assignments, interactions, assessments and analytics 
were all revised to be manageable with up to 500 participants. 
Ultimately, 460 registered for the course, including 8 who also 
enrolled for official university credit and agreed to complete all 
optional assignments. Some participants held doctoral degrees in 
education while others had no prior coursework in education. 
In addition to preparing for the BOOC, more scaling took place 
across the BOOC as the features and analytics were streamlined 
and/or automated. Some streamlining involved making more 
efficient use of the instructor’s time as the weekly analytics and 
feedback were handed off to the teaching assistant (TA, the 2nd 
author) and in some cases to an intern (the 3rd author). Other 
streamlining involved moving from the cumbersome manual 
examination of wikifolio pages to downloading spreadsheets to 
automated algorithms.  Other scaling (not discussed here) is 
continuing as entire features are redesigned (and sometimes re-
conceptualized) to function more autonomously. Generally 
speaking, the courses were designed and refined in order to align 
immediate real-time feedback as individual wikifolios were

posted, close feedback across the entire set of wikifolios, proximal 
reflections on wikifolios, and distal assessment of achievement 
and post-hoc examinations of engagement. 
 
3.  LEARNING FEATURES & ANALYTICS 
Thirteen personalized learning features and analytics were scaled.  
Each is described as it was first refined informally and intuitively 
in the small course. The paper then describes how each was scaled 
up in the BOOC and summarizes the associated engagement.  
3.1 Define Personalized Learning Contexts.   
Situative perspectives on cognition suggest that the context in 
which learning occurs is equally as important as the disciplinary 
knowledge that is learned [7, 10].  Thus a core participatory 
design principle is that learners should define a personalized 
context to anchor disciplinary learning.  Throughout the learning 
experience, learners should revisit and refine their characterization 
of their context, co-constructing knowledge of their experience 
alongside the disciplinary knowledge of the course.  A more 
specific principle focuses directly on aspects of disciplinary 
knowledge that are contextual (take meaning from contexts of 
use) and consequential (have consequences from practice); a 
related assumption is that the discourse that follows readily will 
generate factual, procedural, and conceptual knowledge.  In the 
Assessment courses, learners first define a curricular aim that 
represents a particular domain and their actual or aspirational role 
in the educational system (teacher, administrator, researcher, etc.). 
Ideally, personalization should reveal “bottlenecks” [19] that 
impede learning.  In assessment, this is understanding the 
distinction between practices of teaching and the processes of 
learning.  The public individual feedback (described below) 
provides contextualized guidance that is ideal for helping 
newcomers appreciate this seemingly-nuanced distinction. 
In the small class, students defined their personalized learning 
contexts in their first graded wikifolio assignment. After 
introducing themselves on their wikifolio home page, they added 
a subpage where they defined their curricular aim and their 
educational role, interests, and goals. They were instructed to refer 
to a relevant section in the text, the instructor’s example, and 
samples from previous semesters, and to refer to their classmates’ 
examples and instructor feedback once the first few were posted. 
BOOC participants defined their personalized contexts in two 
stages. First, registrants were instructed to draft an initial 
curricular aim and describe their role while registering.  This 
introduced the personalized approach from the outset, and 
presumably discouraged registrants who were not serious about 
taking the course and/or disliked the approach. While 631 
completed a pre-reregistration form that only required an email 
address, 460 completed the registration, and 358 completed the 
initial curricular aim. Eight participants paid full tuition for the 
course in order to earn three graduate credits and were required to 
complete all parts of all assignments. Registrants’ aim and role 
were automatically inserted into the wikifolio for the first 
assignment, which had them elaborate on the aim and role, 
describe their goals, and locate a relevant educational standard. 
Participants were encouraged to examine others’ work and 
individual and social feedback (described below) was provided.  
Each wikifolio assignment instructed participants to use their 
expanding knowledge of assessment to further refine the 
description of their context and curricular aim.  To emphasize this 
aspect of learning, they were encouraged to return to this 
introductory wikifolio element after completing the other parts. 
Post-hoc analysis of the change of this element from one wikifolio 

to the next revealed an average change of 140 words, with spikes 
at the transition to Part Two and to Part Three 

3.2 Assign Networking Groups 
The formation of affinity groups around common interests is a 
crucial aspect of participatory learning [6]. Interaction within and 
between “networking groups” helps learners see how the 
disciplinary knowledge of the course takes on different meaning 
in different contexts.  In the small course, students were 
intuitively assigned to groups using the information they provided 
in the first assignment. Reassignments and group mergers were 
handled informally and case-by-case. In the BOOC, assignment to 
a larger number of larger groups was done systematically by 
downloading the information provided at registration to a 
spreadsheet. Participants were then assigned to the networking 
groups by adding identifiers to their names and using that 
information to sort the display of names on the participant page. 

3.3.  Identify Secondary/Emergent Groups 
As participatory learning unfolds, new cross-cutting groups 
should emerge. In the small class, this was supported informally 
as students got to know each other, and primarily concerned 
academic domains.  Thus, mathematics teachers might seek out 
administrators and researchers with interest with mathematics. In 
the BOOC, the third assignment invited participants to revisit their 
profiles and extend their name to add self-defined identifiers to 
afford secondary groups and project more distinct identities. Fifty-
nine percent of those who posted the third wikifolio did so. Most 
extensions were disciplinary, and some resulted in new cross-
cutting groups (e.g., mathematics) that fostered additional affinity. 
A few non-disciplinary extensions (e.g., “unemployed”) seemed 
to foster additional affinity without distracting.   

3.4 Post Course Artifacts Publically 
Meaningful artifacts are central to participatory learning [18].  
Artifacts that are public and persistent play a crucial role in the 
interest-driven social networks that provide much of the 
inspiration for participatory learning [17]. This is the logic behind 
the wikifolio assignments introduced above.  Students in the small 
class viewed a streaming video on making wikifolios, accessed 
guidelines for each, and posted a single continuous page. In the 
BOOC, guidelines were contained in section headers that could be 
shown or hidden in edit and view modes.  In edit mode a 
WYSIWYG text-editing window appeared in each section.  This 
design helped frame the wikifolios as stand-alone documents 
(rather than class “assignments”). One new feature allowed 
BOOC participants to choose to Save as Draft or Post for Review. 
Another new feature posted a link next to each participant’s name 
at the course homepage. This simplified the process of locating 
classmates whose wikifolios were ready for review and 
comments, and facilitated some of the other analytics. 

3.5.  Rank Relative Relevance 
The prior research confirmed that having learners rank targeted 
elements of disciplinary knowledge in terms of relevance to their 
particular context was a productive course feature. The 
“contextual” and “consequential” interaction and discourse that it 
affords lends itself nicely to disciplinary interaction among 
students and instructors [15]. For example, sometimes students 
appeared to rank an idea as least-relevant because they did not 
understand its relationship to their context.  This was an inviting 
context for others to point to unexplored relevance. 

94



 
 

In the small course, students were instructed to summarize the 
ideas in order of relevance and include rationale for the ordering. 
In the BOOC, participants rearranged text boxes containing 
summaries of the ideas (and sometimes links to additional 
information) and provided a rationale in the text box below. This 
simplified the process and generated data for social feedback. 

3.6.  Accessing Personalized Content.  
Consistent with connectivist views of learning [4], learners locate 
new course content that is relevant to their personalized context.  
In the small online course, some assignments instructed students 
to (a) use search engines and a “classwiki” to search for outside 
resources, (b) include links to those resources in their wikifolio, 
and (c) add annotated links into the classwiki. Informal analytics 
organized the classwiki, helped struggling students locate 
resources, and provided individual and social feedback.  This was 
all done informally and intuitively. This support was laborious 
and limited by the instructor’s available time. 
In the BOOC, this activity was introduced gradually. The 
assignments in the first part of the course were completed using 
the well-structured guidelines in the textbook.  The assignments in 
the second part of the course had participants search for relevant 
resources and post links to their wikifolio.  Assignments in the 
third part had participants rank the relative relevance of a range of 
provided resources and then search for new resources to share 
with their peers. These new resources were automatically 
compiled on a page where they could be readily located. 

3.7.  Public Individualized Feedback 
Most interaction in these courses occurs publically and 
persistently within threaded comments at the bottom of each 
wikifolio.  In the small course, the LMS notified the instructor 
that the initial wikifolios are posted; the instructor immediately 
provided relatively extensive feedback.  This included more 
nuanced concepts that were too advanced to be included in the 
assignment (where they would overwhelm the less experienced 
students). The instructor immediately sent a message to the class 
thanking those students for posting early and encouraging other 
students to examine the examples and the feedback.  While this 
practice was time-sensitive and time-consuming for the instructor, 
comments from students around that feedback and in the 
collaboration reflections (described below) confirmed that 
students read and used the early feedback. A similar strategy was 
employed in the BOOC, except that the TA helped identify the 
best early posters from the larger number that posted on the first 
day, and helped draft the more routine feedback, allowing the 
instructor to focus on inserting the advanced ideas and opinions.   

3.8. Peer Commenting and Discussion 
While artifact comments anchor interaction to contexts, strategies 
are needed to elevate illustrative interactions involving a few 
learners (and instructors and TAs) so that they are apparent to all 
learners. In the small class, each assignment instructed students to 
post at least one question about their own wikifolio as a comment 
to their peers and the instructor. Students were also instructed to 
comment on “three or more” classmates’ wikifolios.  In addition 
to the early feedback described above, the instructor was able to 
informally track most of the conversation and highlight the most 
productive interactions in weekly summaries. In the most recent 
class, wikifolios attracted an average of six comments. Coding 
revealed that 89% of the comments concerned educational 
assessment and that 78% concerned the week’s assignment. 

Significantly, 33% of comments made reference to context (either 
the wiki author or the commenter and sometimes both). 
Wikifolios received an average of 2.9 comments and the average 
number was relatively constant across the course. Post hoc 
analysis of one third of the wikifolios revealed that 65% included 
an initial question and 55% of those questions got a response. 
Coding of comments was streamlined by a subsystem that output 
comment text and context, allowing faster examination of the 
impact of new or modified assignment features on engagement.   

3.9 Instructor and Peer Endorsement 
Artifact-oriented education calls for some form of accountability 
for the artifact quality and associated interactions.  Yet, even with 
a highly structured rubric, it would be overwhelming to formally 
grade such extensive artifacts and interactions.  More importantly, 
doing so is likely to undermine the disciplinary engagement that 
occurs when creating and discussing artifacts. 
In the small course, a core innovation emerged around the notion 
of consequential engagement [9]. Each wikifolio assignment 
included three reflections to be completed a week after the 
original deadline (presumably before beginning the next 
wikifolio).  These included consequential engagement (“what will 
you do differently in your context as a consequence of learning 
this knowledge?”), critical engagement (“how suitable was your 
context for learning this knowledge?”), and collaborative 
engagement (“who else’s work and whose comments helped you 
learn this knowledge?”).  Each wikifolio was awarded full points 
(5 out of 100) as long as a complete draft was posted on time and 
the reflections were coherent. Analyses of reflections in the small 
class (and other contexts) confirmed that (a) it was difficult for 
students to write coherent reflections without having (or getting) a 
reasonable understanding of the targeted concepts and (b) the 
public nature of the artifacts discouraged students from “gaming” 
the system by reflecting on incomplete assignments [15].    
This artifact accountability strategy was too laborious for the 
BOOC.  In response, the reflections were deemed optional and 
artifact accountability was accomplished via peer endorsement.  
Once a wikifolio is posted, peers (but not the author) can click a 
button to endorse it as Complete (required elements) or Complete 
(including optional elements).  Participants were instructed to 
endorse at least three wikifolios as part of their peer interaction. 
There was no limit to the number of endorsements and the names 
of each endorser were displayed on the wikifolio. Participants 
whose wikifolios were complete but unendorsed were invited to 
request TA endorsement if necessary. 
The BOOC peer accountability strategy for artifacts was 
remarkably successful. Wikifolios earned an average of 5.1 
endorsements, increasing from 3.6 in the first week to 5.7 on the 
last week.  Formal review of all endorsed wikifolios revealed that 
just two percent were incomplete. The exception was the 
instruction to post a question to peers, which perhaps one third of 
the wikifolios lacked.  

3.10. Peer Promotion 
Another core participatory design principle is that disciplinary 
engagement should be recognized and rewarded, but that should 
occur outside any formal evaluation or accountability system.  
This is because the summative function of formal evaluation 
undermines engagement by encouraging students to “game” the 
system and the community.  Students in the small course were 
instructed to post one (and only one) “stamp of approval” each 
week via a comment starting with a distinctive string (&&&) that 

95



 
 

warranted their claim that the artifact, exchange, or comment was 
exemplary. The wikifolio homepage indicated which student 
earned the most such stamps each week.  
In the BOOC, participants simply clicked a box to promote a 
wikifolios, which then asked them to add a warrant. The names of 
promoters and their warrants were then displayed on the wikifolio. 
Participant in each group with most promotions each week were 
acknowledged in the weekly feedback.  The group members with 
the most promotions for each of the three units and for the entire 
course were awarded “leader” versions of the digital badges 
describe below. Participation in peer promotion averaged 67%, 
increasing from 51% in the first week to 77% in in the last week. 

3.11.  Weekly Individual & Social Feedback 
As detailed above, much of the interaction each week considered 
the relative relevance of that week’s ideas from the specific 
perspective of individual peers and the more general perspective 
of different groups.  Doing so prepared both individuals and 
groups to learn more by seeing the eventual rankings of relevance 
of those ideas for the various networking groups and revisiting 
exemplary considerations of those relationships.  For example, 
when learning about validity, that fact the teachers, 
administrators, and researchers respectively found content 
validity, criterion validity, and construct validity most relevant 
clearly reified important (but initially nuanced) distinctions that 
learners first encountered during the assignment. In the small 
class, the instructor drafted a weekly summary while reviewing 
and commenting on student assignments. This information and 
links to good examples were then posted as an announcement. 
The course evaluations confirmed that students liked this feedback 
and enjoyed seeing themselves and classmates recognized.  But 
the process was time-sensitive and time-consuming for the 
instructor. Some students complained that the feedback arrived 
too late and that the process was biased to reward early posters. 
In the BOOC, all of the relevance rankings were accessed via a 
spreadsheet, which supported additional tagging, coding, and 
counting; examples were selected starting with the wikifolios that 
received the most promotions.  While still requiring 
approximately five hours per week, this was entirely managed by 
the TA.  

 3.12   Appropriate Accountability 
A situative focus on productive forms of disciplinary engagement 
reframes traditional notions of assessment [6, 8, 11, 13].  This 
treats classroom assessments as “peculiar” forms of disciplinary 
discourse that are primarily useful for improving curriculum and 
of little value for directly advancing knowledge; standards-
oriented achievement tests become “bizarre” discourse that is 
primarily useful for evaluating complete courses and seeing broad 
improvement over time, but nearly useless for evaluating 
individuals or directly advancing individual learning. 
The small class took timed exams with both open-ended items and 
multiple-choice items. The open-ended items were curriculum-
oriented; each asked students to consider the relevance of a 
randomly selected chapter implication to the small class context in 
five minutes; the multiple choice items were randomly selected 
from the textbook item bank and students were given two minutes 
per item. Item-level feedback was only provided for the open-
ended items and the midterm and final exams were worth just 30 
of 100 points. Average scores have averaged around 90%. 
Individual exam scores typically mirrored engagement and were 
generally where weaker students ended up with lower grades. 

Because of the workload, the open-ended items were dropped in 
the BOOC, which included three 20-item unit exams and a 30-
item comprehensive final.  While item-level feedback was not 
provided, participants were allowed to take the exams twice in 
three hours and take the final twice in four hours.   Participants 
were required to complete the exams and final to earn digital 
badges, but the original 80% criteria was relaxed.  Participants 
were able to choose whether they included their exam 
performance on their digital badges, and exam scores were 
factored into final course grades for the for-credit students. 
Average scores for non-credit participants were 84%, 76%, 78%, 
and 75%, while average scores for the for-credit students were 
88%, 83%, 78%, and 82%.   

3.13.  Web-Enabled Digital Badges  
In contrast to conventional credentials, open digital badges can 
contain specific claims about learning and achievement, along 
with detailed evidence (and links to additional evidence) 
supporting those claims. Open badges can be readily accumulated 
in external “backpacks” and shared over social networks. In the 
most recent small class, the instructor experimented with 
awarding open badges in order to prepare for the BOOC. The 
badges were issued directly to the Mozilla backpack and 
summarized the assignments the student had completed and 
indicated that they had passed the exam. 
In the BOOC, badges were automatically generated and could 
contain details regarding the assignments completed, number of 
comments, endorsements, promotions, and exam performance.  
Significantly earners were able to select which evidence to be 
included, and whether to include links to their completed 
wikifolios (minus peer comments for privacy).  Participants could 
earn one badges for each of three course parts; participants who 
earned all three and completed the final exam were issued the 
Assessment Expert badge. A Leader version of each of the four 
badges was issued to the participant in each group who earned the 
most promotions; a customizable Expert badge which displayed 
the earners self-define area of assessment expertise was offered to 
participants who turned their weekly wikifolios into a 
comprehensive paper.  In the end of course survey, 41% of 
completers reported sharing their badges, mostly via Facebook 
and/or email.  While seven of the participants submitted a paper, 
only four of the papers met the criteria for the custom badge.  

4.  CONCLUSIONS 
In light of the low completion and engagement rates reported for 
university-sponsored MOOCs [2], the BOOC appeared quite 
promising.  Of the 160 participants who completed the first 
assignment, 60 (37%) completed the course.  In contrast to the 
declining engagement among completers in most MOOC, 
engagement levels across the BOOC units was stable (comments) 
or increased (endorsements and promotions). BOOC completers 
reported working an average of 7.5 hours per week, with a high of 
30 hours.  Open-ended comments were overwhelmingly positive; 
one participant who completed his MS and PhD at top-ranked 
universities deemed the BOOC “best graduate-level education 
course he had ever taken.” Reassuringly, there were virtually no 
“meltdowns” like those at one widely cited failure to foster more 
participatory personalized learning at a massive scale [25]. 
The success of this course supports four suggestions for scaling up 
participatory learning.  The first suggestion is that scaling should 
be done incrementally. With around 100 participants completing 
weekly assignments, it is possible to gradually streamline the 
learning analytics by handing them off to a TA and making use 

96



 
 

spreadsheets and the other resources. With thousands of learners, 
this useful iterative refinement and the insights that followed 
would have been impossible. While this brief paper does not 
allow elaboration, efforts are already underway to further 
streamline most BOOC features and analytics to allow their use in 
automated and/or massive contexts. 
The second suggestion is that efforts to scale should consider 
design-based research methods [4]. The specific effort described 
here was part of a larger ongoing effort to refine and exemplify a 
set of more general participatory design principles.  In translating 
these more general principles into specific features and analytics, 
more specific design principles are emerging alongside 
knowledge of the contextual factors that help make them possible. 
Together, these general principles, specific principles, specific 
features, and contextual factors offer useful knowledge for 
broader effort and the efforts of others 
The third suggestion is that the design principles used to scale 
participatory learning embrace emerging situative theories of 
assessment. [8, 11, 12] This provides a coherent framework for 
aligning informal assessment during activities, semi-formal 
assessment in reflections, and formal assessment in exams.   
The final suggestion is that the design and refinements of 
interactive features and analytics focus on contextual and 
consequential knowledge.  Doing so appears to be a scalable way 
to foster the natural forms of disciplinary engagement [5] that that 
can also foster learning of the factual, procedural, and conceptual 
knowledge that courses are typically accountable for.
