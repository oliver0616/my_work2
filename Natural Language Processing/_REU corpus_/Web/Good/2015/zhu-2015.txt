ABSTRACT 
Eye tracking is a useful tool to understand students’ cognitive 
process during problem solving. This paper offers a unique 
perspective by applying techniques from social network analysis 
to eye movement patterns in mathematics problem solving. We 
construct and visualize transition networks using eye-tracking 
data collected from 37 8th grade students while solving linear 
function problems. By applying network analysis on the 
constructed transition networks, we find general transition 
patterns between areas of interest (AOIs) for all students, and we 
also compare patterns for high- and low-performing students. Our 
results show that even though students share general transition 
patterns during problem solving, high-performing students made 
more strategic transitions among AOI triples than low-performing 
students.

1. INTRODUCTION 
One way to study why some students perform better than others 
while solving problems is to describe how they solve problems 
differently. However, mental processes during problem-solving 
are usually not directly observable. Researchers have used various 
methodologies to measure cognitive processes using techniques 
such as eye tracking (e.g., [24]), EEG (e.g., [15]), and action logs 
(e.g., [14]) or keystroke data (e.g., [1]) automatically recorded by 
the servers for computerized tasks.  
In this paper, we explore the use of one of these techniques, 
eyetracking, to study students’ eye-movement patterns during 
mathematics problem solving. While most previous studies 
focused on analyzing the length of time that students spent on 

different areas [17, 18] on the paper or the screen, this paper takes 
a different approach by investigating the dynamic process and the 
transitions among different areas that students look at during 
problem solving. While transitions among AOIs have long been 
studied in eye-tracking research [12], the methods are often task-
specific and difficult to apply in the analysis of complex tasks. 
Here we introduce techniques from the field of social network 
analysis (SNA) [26], adapting them for analyzing transitions of 
eye movements. Our empirical data come from a mathematics 
task that assesses middle school students’ understanding of linear 
functions. In our dataset, eye movement data were collected from 
37 8th grade students. We analyzed the transition patterns of all 
students and also compared the differences between high-
performing and low-performing students. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related 
studies and applications of eyetracking, especially in an education 
setting. Section 3 describes the dataset and the Moving Sidewalks 
task used in this study, as well as the general background of the 
CBAL initiative (Cognitively Based Assessment of, for, and as 
Learning; [4]) and learning progression. Section 4 introduces the 
network measures applied for eye-tracking analysis, network 
visualization, and related results. Section 5 extends the network 
analysis to compare students from different performing groups. 
Section 6 includes discussion and future directions for additional 
studies. In all analyses and comparisons, we focus on general 
applications of the SNA techniques and give only high-level 
interpretation of results. Substantive interpretation in terms of the 
meaning of results for solving the linear functions task is left for 
future studies. 

2. RELATED WORK 
Eye movements provide moment-by-moment information on 
visual attention, which is a close indicator of the information 
being processed [6, 22]. Many studies have used eye tracking to 
study human reading behavior. One of the first models of eye 
movements in reading developed by Just and Carpenter [13] 
proposed the eye-mind principle, that is, wherever the mind 
“wants” to see, the eye moves to. It is not surprising that much of 
their model was a production system simulating cognitive 
processes in reading. The eye-mind assumption was soon found 
overly simplistic (see [22]) and more sophisticated models 
emerged to account for oculomotor factors in eye movements 
(e.g., [6]). But this does not change the larger picture, that is, that 
the eye gaze is a proxy of the attention “spotlight” [7, 21]. This 
explains why eyetracking has attracted increasing attention among 
assessment researchers [8, 9]. 

In educational research, eye movements have been used to study 
students’ problem solving processes and performance in various 
domains. For instance, the study by Tai, Loehr, & Brigham [24] 
collected eye-tracking data on six preservice science teachers 
while they solved an 18-item multiple-choice science assessment.

6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we constructed eye-movement transition networks 
and conducted related analysis on these networks. The results 
show that, in general, students did not make random decisions on 
transition among AOIs and they tend to revisit previously visited 
ones. Comparing high- and low-performing students in terms of 
their mastery of linear functions, it was found that low-performing 
students are more likely to consider information in isolation, 
whereas high-performing students tend to connect multiple 
sources of information in solving complex math problems.  
As in any other methods using transition matrices, the network 
analyses in this paper share the limitation of partially ignoring the 
sequential information in the eye-tracking data. For instance, in a 
triadic structure, the information of which link happened first was 
not recorded. Despite this limitation, the analysis still provides us 
useful information on students’ cognitive process during problem 
solving.  
The current work can be extended in several directions. First, 
numerous other network measures can be applied to the AOI 
network analysis. For example, the network centrality measure 
[26] can provide information on the preferred AOIs by students. 
Second, cluster analysis can be conducted on the transition 
networks and related measures used to discover latent subgroups 
of students, some of which may shed more light on student 
cognition than their test scores. Last, the current analysis focuses 
only on transition structures and not the content of the AOIs. 
Further analysis with AOI information can provide more detailed 
information on the transition patterns.
