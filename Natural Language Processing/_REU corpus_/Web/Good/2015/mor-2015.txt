ABSTRACT 
In today's job market, computer skills are part of the 
prerequisites for many jobs. In this paper, we report on a study 
of readiness to work with computers (the dependent variable) 
among unemployed women (N=54) after participating in a 
unique training focused on computer skills and empowerment. 
Associations were explored between this variable and 17 
variables from four categories: log-based, computer literacy and 
experience, job-seeking motivation and practice, and training 
satisfaction. Only two variables were associated with the 
dependent variable: Knowledge post-test duration and 
satisfaction with content. Building a prediction model of the 
dependent variable, another feature was highlighted: Total 
number of actions in the course website along the course. Our 
analyses highlight the predominance of the log-based variables 
over the variables from the other categories, and we thoroughly 
discuss this finding.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Information and communication technology (ICT) is part of 
everyday life in the 21st century, and the rapid development of 
ICT requires a completely new set of skills related to 
technological literacy. As new technology is constantly being 
developed, fluency with information technology and computer 
self-efficacy are gaining more importance regarding the profiles 
of employees in today's job market.

Computer self-efficacy is defined as “an individual’s perceptions 
of his or her ability to use computers in the accomplishment of a 
task rather than reflecting simple component skills” [1]. 
Computer self-efficacy was found to be positively related to 
computer usage, previous experience, and – directly related to 
our study - computer training and computer self-efficacy (or 
similar constructs) were found (e.g., [3,4]). There is no wonder, 
therefore, that unemployed older workers express a desire to 
receive additional training on technology, preferable in a hands-
on fashion [2]. 
Therefore, training programs for employees often suggest both 
computer-related content and modules which aim on improving 
the participants' self-efficacy concerning working in today's job 
market; such a program is at the heart of the current study. 
While many previous studies have examined the efficiency of 
such programs in improving measures related to computer self-
efficacy, the novelty of the current study is in examining the 
relationships between of log-based (training-related) variables 
and a variable similar to computer self-efficacy. 
Though very simple, these log-based measures outperform other 
variables—including such variables that were found in previous 
studies as good indicators to computer self-efficacy—in 
predicting the dependent variable, which measures perceptions 
of unemployed women's readiness to work with computers. 

2. METHODOLOGY 
2.1 Research Field 
Data analyzed for this study was drawn from Appleseeds 
Academy's "Technological Empowerment for Unemployed 
Women" course (TEUW). During this course, unemployed 
women are taught basic computer applications and best job-
seeking practices. In addition, the participants take part in an 
empowerment workshop, in order to enhance their chances of 
finding a job. A typical course includes 16 meetings (4.5-hour 
long each) taken within one month. The course is accompanied 
by a Moodle website, holding all of the materials used during 
the meetings and extra materials for self-learning.  

2.2 Participants, Data, Research Variables 
Overall, we collected data of 54 participants, all women of ages 
25-65, who took the TEUW course during February-March 
2014. Participants were drawn from groups located in different 
areas of Israel, including both big cities and small towns. Data 
were collected via knowledge pre/post-tests, pre/post surveys of 
computer use and attitudes towards computers, and log files. 

The dependent variable is Post-training Employment 
Readiness High/Low. It is binary (1/0 for high/low readiness), 

400



based on a median split of the average of five employment-
efficacy items in the post-survey; each of which was scored on a 
5-point Likert scale (e.g., "I feel confident to present my skills 
and strengths", "I feel confident to go to job interviews"). 

The 17 independent variables are divided into four categories: 

2.2.1 Log-based Variables 
For each participant, Total Number of Actions and Knowledge 
Pre/Post-Test Length (time-difference between entrance to the 
test and hitting the "Finish" button [seconds]) were computed. 

2.2.2 Computer Literacy, Experience 
Knowledge Pre/Post-Test Score (percentage of correct answers 
from the pre/post knowledge test) and Computer Pre/Post-Use 
(average of pre/post survey items referring to computer 
applications use, originally rated on a 5-point Likert scale). 

2.2.3 Job-seeking Motivation and Practice 
Based on relevant items (originally scored on a 5-point Likert 
scale) from the pre/post survey, we computed: Pre-training 
Employment Readiness (based on the pre survey, calculated 
similarly to the dependent variable, without a median split), 
Motivation towards the Training (1 item), Pre/Post Job-seeking 
Activeness (6 items), and Pre/Post Beliefs in Finding Suitable 
Job (1 item). 

2.2.4 Training Satisfaction 
These variables are based on the post survey (originally scored 
on a 5-point Likert scale): Satisfaction with Content (5 items), 
Satisfaction with Instructor (7 items), Satisfaction with 
Empowerment Workshop (9 items), Satisfaction with Final 
Project (3 items). 

3. SUMMARY OF RESULTS 
3.1 Pre/Post-Training Employment Readiness 
As a first step, we explored some statistics of the Pre/Post-
training Employment Readiness variables (see Table 1). Overall, 
the mean Post (M=4.45, SD=0.61) is meaningfully and 
statistically significantly higher than the mean c:\temp\Pre 
(M=3.66, SD=0.88), with t(53)=5.33, at p<0.001 (a paired-
sample t-test was used). Overall, it seems that the course had 
dramatically increased the level of participants' readiness to 
work with computers, and that the Post-training Employment 
Readiness might even demonstrate a ceiling effect. 

3.2 Direct Relationship between the 
Dependent and the Independent Variables 
While exploring direct relationships between the dependent 
variable and the independent variables – using independent-
sample t-tests – we have found only two significant 
relationships. These relationships were found to log-based and 
satisfaction-related variables: 

? Participants with high Post-training Employment 
Readiness values took the knowledge post-test (Knowledge 
Post-Test Length) much quicker than those with low 
values (~23 minutes, compared with ~37 minutes); 

? Participants with high Post-training Employment 
Readiness values were satisfied with the course content 

(Satisfaction with Content) more than those with low 
values (4.59 on a 5-point Likert scale, compared with 
4.23). 

3.3 Predicting the Dependent Variable 
We developed a decision tree model, using RapidMiner Studio, 
to predict the dependent variable, using a manual forward 
feature selection. Of the single-feature models, only one 
performed better than chance. The final model has a LOOCV 
kappa of 0.524. The tree size is 16, its height is 7, and it has 9 
leaves (Figure 1, confusion matrix in Table 1). Overall, three 
variables entered the best decision tree in the following order: 
Knowledge Post-Test Length, Satisfaction with Content, Total 
Number of Actions. 

Post Test Length > 2911: L {L=7, H=0} 
Post Test Length ? 2911 
| Satisfaction with Content > 3.7 
| | Num. of Actions > 14 
| | | Num. of Actions > 19 
| | | | Post Test Length > 1008 
| | | | | Post Test Length > 1299 
| | | | | | Post Test Length > 1596 
| | | | | | | Num. of Actions > 61: H {L=1, H=7} 
| | | | | | | Num. of Actions ? 61: L {L=2, H=1} 
| | | | | | Post Test Length ? 1596: H {L=0, H=8} 
| | | | | Post Test Length ? 1299: L {L=7, H=1} 
| | | | Post Test Length ? 1008: H {L=0, H=6} 
| | | Num. of Actions ? 19: L {L=2, H=0} 
| | Num. of Actions ? 14: H {L=0, H=8} 
| Satisfaction with Content ? 3.7: L {L=4, H=0}
