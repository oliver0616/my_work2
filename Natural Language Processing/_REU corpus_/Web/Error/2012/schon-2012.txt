ABSTRACT 
One of the first and basic mathematical knowledge of school 
children is the multiplication table. At the age of 8 to 10 each 
child has to learn by training step by step, or more scientifically, 
by using a behavioristic learning concept. Due to this fact it can 
be mentioned that we know very well about the pedagogical 
approach, but on the other side there is rather less knowledge 
about the increase of step-by-step knowledge of the school 
children. 

In this publication we present some data documenting the 
fluctuation in the process of acquiring the multiplication tables. 
We report the development of an algorithm which is able to adapt 
the given tasks out of a given pool to unknown pupils. For this 
purpose a web-based application for learning the multiplication 
table was developed and then tested by children. Afterwards so-
called learning curves of each child were drawn and analyzed by 
the research team as well as teachers carrying out interesting 
outcomes. Learning itself is maybe not as predictable as we know 
from pedagogical experiences, it is a very individualized process 
of the learners themselves. 

It can be summarized that the algorithm itself as well as the 
learning curves are very useful for studying the learning success. 
Therefore it can be concluded that learning analytics will become 
an important step for teachers and learners of tomorrow.

1. Introduction 
Phil Long and George Siemens stated [11] that “the most dramatic 
factor shaping the future of higher education is something that we 
can’t actually touch or see: big data and analytics.” In other words 
if a lot of learning data is measured and analyzed, new insights 

into the learning process will be given and therefore new 
didactical approaches will help to improve our learning behaviors 
– not only in higher education but in the whole educational 
system. Of course the main question addressed by Erik Duval [2] 
is about what exactly should be measured to get a deeper 
understanding of how learning takes place. 

In this publication we like to answer the following research 
question: “How can we improve learning the multiplication table 
with the help of an individualized learning program and a follow-
up data analyzing?” 

First of all, it must be mentioned that learning the multiplication 
table is a central subject of mathematics in primary school. Young 
children gradually develop an intuitive and practical arithmetic 
that they use to solve problems successfully and confidently in 
their everyday life. But each child is different and some of the 
basic knowledge about mathematics is acquired even before 
children start school [8] [14]. Considering current didactical 
knowledge about learning math tells us, that there are cultural 
differences, some obviously based on language implications [3]. 
Each child needs a general linguistic competence before starting 
to operate with numbers. Some publications point out that 
mathematic is the first non-native language [9]. For example, 
understanding the simple expression “multiply” is implicitly not 
only a mathematical problem but also a linguistic one. Many 
children who carry out the algorithms correctly do not really 
understand reasons for crucial aspects of the procedure [6].  

The most common and traditional way to learn the multiplication 
table is drill and practice without taking care of any linguistic 
preconditions. “Multiplication Tables in 21 days” [12] is one of 
many offers of teach the kids online or to use traditional materials. 

From the perspective of special education it is well-known that 
this way of teaching and learning math is problematic and leads to 
disorders and blockades on the learner’s side. The “defective 
number module hypothesis” indicates a genetic defect, a more 
physiological cause of basic brain functionality [1]. Teachers 
gladly accepted such a biological explanation as a relief for their 
problems with a child. According to current neurological oriented 
research results, but also based on a very old educational tradition, 
teaching should use tactile, optical and acoustic processing 
methods in every single case – intensively when they observe 
deviations from the mainstream. It is important to allow 
multisensory math to be taught to children with special 
educational needs. Kendall [7] offers some practical suggestions 
of how to achieve this. Furthermore face-to-face teaching has to 
bear in mind also interlinking between different assignments. But 
the daily practice is dominated by pure “row learning” of the 
multiplication table [5].

It has to be borne in mind that learning per se is an active 
individual process on the learners themselves. The competence 
“perfect handling the multiplication table” differs enormously in 
the needed learning time and resulting learning effort – from 
weeks to years. 

It is obvious that the simple problem “learning the multiplication 
table” is not as trivial as it seems to be at first glance. The goal of 
our research is to develop a web-based system that assists learners 
as well as teachers. Furthermore it should provide teachers with 
an overview about the current learning process of their pupils. The 
research group (consisting of educators, e-learning experts, an 
educational scientist and IT-developers) specified their 
requirements as follows: 

• The system should estimate the competence grade of 
the learner 

• The system should provide appropriate exercises 
according to the competence grade of the learner. 
Nevertheless the exercises should tend to be 
challenging. 

• The system should ensure that already well-done 
exercises are repeated and practiced. After succeeding a 
problem the probability for a repeated display decreases 
in two levels (analogous to a Leitner System [10]) 

• In general the system should be motivating and show 
that learning can be fun.  

• The system should record and safe fine-grained data of 
all done exercises, test results and the current 
competence grade of the learner in order to prepare the 
next sessions in an adequate way. 

• Thereby it should unburden the teachers from that task.  

In contrast to many other approaches to adopt learners in this 
research work there are no probabilistic strategies for estimating 
competencies used. Even more the goal is to generate a complete 
table to inform learners as well as teachers about their problems in 
every single task. And for sure teachers want to know something 
about the process, the used time and the up and down of the 
learning curves.  

Similar research work in the area of Intelligent Tutoring Systems 
(ITS) [4] [13] pointed out that such an approach can raise many 
problems for daily-life-situations of an actual classroom. In other 
words, our research work concentrates on a particular and small 
learning problem, but likes to ensure the learning success. 

Finally, the implemented intelligent algorithm is not only useable 
for the specific problem of learning the multiplication table. Any 
problem that is presented in a set of flashcards could be easily 
transferred to a system with this functionality.  

2. Technical details about the application 
Beforehand some technical details need to be mentioned that were 
defined by the project team: 

The application is written in PHP1 5. The interface is based on 
HTML2 and CSS3. Because of the different render engines of the 
browsers the CSS-Framework YAML4 is used. Carrying out a

2 Hypertext Markup Language 
3 Cascading Style Sheets 
4 Yet Another Multicolumn Layout (http://www.yaml.de/; last 

visited October 2011) 

solid software development the application is programmed with 
the help of Zend Framework5.  

The main approach is to store the data of each learner to analyze 
their learning process. 

3. Algorithm 
The approach of this research study is to develop an algorithm 
that allows an individual learning by providing exercises in 
dependence on the learner’s knowledge. Therefore the main task 
is to consider which exercise is provided next. On the one side, 
the exercise should be challenging on the other side it must be 
adequate; not too difficult but not too easy at all. Therefore the 
core task of the program is the new designed algorithm. This 
algorithm decides which question is chosen to be next. The 
general idea is to always find the “best learnable” question in 
reference to Vygotskys [15] idea of "the zone of proximal 
development" for the user. Therefore two parameters are 
important: 

• Difficulty of the exercise: First of all each learning 
exercise has to get a difficulty rank. If the task 
difficulties are already known from a preliminary 
investigation (for example a pedagogical study), they 
should be used in that way. Otherwise a hierarchy of 
estimated difficulties must be assumed according to 
specific pedagogical experiences. The difficulty ranks 
should then be converted to a scale with values between 
0 and 1. This means an easy question gets a high 
success probability value (close to 1) and a more 
difficult one gets a low success probability value (close 
to 0). 

• Degree of competence: To keep track of the learning 
progress of a user the degree of competence is 
calculated (0 ... 1), called learning rate. The calculation 
of this value depends on the performance of each 
learner and is calculated in real time.  

• When we started developing this program we used 
“degree of competence” in the sense of ratio of items, 
which have been solved to the sum of items which has 
been offered. During the further process we found out 
that it is more useful to have a less volatile variable for 
determining the level of the next question and two 
others (learning rate 1 & 2) for describing the success 
and analyses. 

3.1 Degree of competence  
The basic idea of a degree of competence (DOC) is to indicate 
which question is difficult and which is easy in relation to the 
current user´s knowledge. It must be considered, that for the first 
session we don’t know anything about the competence level of the 
student so far. With every answered question we get a more and 
more reliable estimation of the real competence.  

The main idea is that each user has their specific degree of 
competence equaling a value between 0 and 1. 1 means the user is 
advanced and every item could be selected as a suitable task or 
question, 0.5 indicates an intermediate user and 0 is a beginner. In 
general the degree of competence reflects the current knowledge. 
Questions graded “below” the individual degree of competence 
are solved and known by the learner; questions “above” are 
questions to be learned. When the next learning item is chosen it 
must be avoided that the task is neither too difficult (learners will

get frustrated) nor too easy (learners will become bored). To 
fulfill that demand we have to assess the questions given to be 
homogenous compared to traditional tasks. The amount of data 
collected by the application helps us to discuss for example 
whether this homogeneity is really given, and whether the 
students achieve the learning goals in typical, well known and 
logical or different and more individualized learning paths.  

We use the idea of a so-called “extended learning area” to 
describe the pool of which learners get the next tasks from. By 
definition the whole learning area is a combination of the actual 
learning area (known by the learner) and the extended learning 
area (unknown by the learner). In our pilot study we defined the 
extended learning area to be 25% above the learner’s degree of 
competence. Of course this parameter can be adjusted by teachers. 
In a situation where the teacher anticipates a low level of 
competence in this domain, at the beginning of learning the tables, 
this value must be kept down. Over the time, for example when 
learners are starting to learn the multi-digit multiplication, it could 
be become higher.  

Figure 1 visualizes the whole learning area sectioned by the 
degree of competence into an area of known questions (actual 
learning area) and one of future questions (extended learning area) 
limited by the extended degree of competence.  

 

Figure 1 Degree of competences 

 

In the initial test phase, we found out that these settings are 
complicated, especially during the first session when the students 
have only solved some few problems. A computer program is 
restricted in perceiving students’ interaction only towards solved 
or unsolved learning questions. A teacher perceives of course, 
many other and different signals (nervousness, facial expression, 
comments on the task …) that may affect the decision which task 
is to be given next. With other words especially an improper pre-
assessment of learners’ knowledge can be frustrating by keeping 
learners too long overstrained or bored. Furthermore it must be 
avoided, that the tasks’ difficulty escalates too quickly and 
questions therefore become inadequate. In the following chapter 
the design of the pretest is pointed out. 

 

3.2 Pretest 
At the beginning, before the learning session, each learner will be 
asked two questions, starting with a moderate one; if the answer is 
correct; a more difficult one will be presented - the estimated 
degree of competence is set around 0,75. If the answer is incorrect 
an easier one will be provided (around 0,25). Figure 2 points out 
the flow diagram to get the estimated degree of competence in the 
beginning. For example if the first answer is correct and the 
second one false, the estimated learning rate results 0,50.  

Finally to get adequate questions (easy – medium – difficult) the 
following categories are defined 

• Easy: A question with a probability for a correct answer 
of 0,78 – 0,69  

• Medium: A question with a probability success value of 
0,54 – 0,47 

• Difficult: A question with a probability success value of 
0,20 – 0,13 

Figure 2 Pretest – estimated degree of competence 

 

3.3 Answer classification 
Another issue that must be addressed in our context is the 
classification of well-known learning problems. From a 
pedagogical point of view it must be stated that presenting a right 
solution is not a satisfactory indicator. Especially learning the 
multiplication table is learning by drill & practice which means if 
a learner practices one problem more often they will get more 
confident that they can manage this item. Therefore also the 
developed algorithm must ensure that a task is “well-known”. 
This issue is addressed by establishing a “well-known” parameter. 

The answers of the learners are marked with 0, 1 or 2: 

• 0 means a wrong answer 

• 1 shows that the user knew the correct answer once 

• 2 indicates that the student had two consecutive correct 
answers (this means a question is “well known”) 

Questions that have been signed with 2 were set back to 0 
immediately in case the student failed.  

After the pilot stage it was decided to set the “well-known” 
parameter always to 2 when the degree of competence of the 
learner is 0,3 higher than the difficulty of the task. We wanted to 
reduce the frequency of getting too easy tasks for good students. 
Each time a student solves a problem, the result will be stored by 
the application. We calculate a “learning rate 2” to be the ratio of 
the sum of solved items signed with 2 and the number of items. 
We also compute a “learning rate 1”. This ratio is based on the 
sum of all solved items, e.g. signed with 1 or 2.  

75



It is to remark, that these two levels of knowledge and the set 
procedures have the functionality of a Leitner System [10]. The 
results of psychology of memory give the recommendation that 
learned tasks should be used again and again, but there is only a 
decreasing frequency necessary to avoid forgetting the right 
solutions. 

3.4 Adjusting competence 
In the first session we only have the results of the pretest to 
estimate the competence of the respective student and to allocate a 
suitable question. With every new test we get more and better 
information for specifying the student’s current competence.  

At the beginning of our tests we simply calculated the ratio of the 
number of correct answers to all given answers. This leads to the 
following formula: 

?????? ?? ??	
?????? (???) =  
??	 ?? ??? ??????? ???????

??	 ?? ??? ???????
 

This formula resulted in a too high volatility at the beginning of 
the learning progress. For example if a learner answers the first 2 
questions in the pretest correctly the program will assume a 
degree of competence of 0,75. After answering the next 2 
questions wrong the degree of competence decreases to 0,5. The 
fast increase/decrease of the factor of course will cause that 
learners become quickly frustrated.  

A second approach with the intention of getting a more stable 
value was to calculate the degree of competence by counting 
answers only with the classification “well-known” (2). The 
resulting formula is: 

?????? ?? ??	
?????? (???) =
??	??? ?? ???? ????? ???	?

??	??? ?? ???	?
      

number of items = number of learning problems/flashcards provided by 
the system 

This formula has some disadvantages as well, especially for 
learners with a too low estimated degree of competence resulting 
from the pretest. For these learners it might be hard to increase 
their degree of competence, i.e. to correct the erroneous data. 
Finally the degree of competence is defined by the procedure as 
follows:  

We compute the ratio of both - number of correct answers as well 
as well-known answers - and the number of items. 

??? =
?(??	??? ????????? (1)?? ???? ?????(2) ???	? )

??	??? ?? ???	?
      

The results are saved in the database. In general the learning 
progress is considered as completed, if every question is signed 
with 2 (well-known). 

When a learner starts their first session the following procedure 
combines the result of the pretest and the actual degree of 
competence:  

This special procedure is only used at the beginning if  

??	??? ?? ?????? < ????	???? ??? ?  ??	??? ?? ???	? 

Then we compute a “weight”:  

?????? =
??	 ?? ??? ??????? ???????

??	 ?? ??? ???????
 

With this weight, the degree of competence is calculated as a 
combination of the estimated degree of competence of the pretest 
and the previous performance: 

??? = ??? ? (1 ? ??????) + ????	???? ??? ? ?????? 

This degree of competence is important to find the next task in the 
learning area. Therefore it must be guaranteed that the DOC is not 
in-/decreasing too fast in order to provide adequate questions.  

3.5 Selecting items 
After the degree of competence is calculated the next item 
presented to the learner must be chosen. For this purpose, the 
algorithm chooses items out of three categories. 

• Extended and Actual Learning Area (items signed with 
0) 

• Actual Learning Area (items signed with 1) 

• Actual Learning Area (items signed with 2) 

A random number out of the interval 0 and 1 is used to decide 
which category is activated. Therefore three cases are defined: 

• Case 1: If the random number (x) is smaller or equal 
0,05 a well-known question marked with 2 is chosen. 

• Case 2: If the random number is 0,05 > x >= 0,15 a 
known question marked with 1 is chosen.  

• Case 3: If the random number is x > 0,15 a (unknown) 
question out of the extended and actual learning area is 
chosen. 

In general all items are preordered according to their difficulties 
and have corresponding rank numbers. 

In case 1 another random number is drawn to get a position in the 
ranking of the known items. Beginning with this position the 
algorithm is looking for the next less difficult item, which is 
signed with 2.   

In case 2 the algorithm is starting with the rank of the easiest item 
and is looking for the next item, which is signed with 1. 

In case 3 our selection is adjusted with the degree of competence. 
We compute an upper rank for the selection: 

???? = ??	??? ?? ???	? ?  1,25 ? ?????? ?? ??	
?????? 

Afterwards the algorithm is starting to search beginning with rank 
position rank or less difficult items. The next item, which is 
signed with 0, is selected.  

In the case the algorithm is running out of the ranking, because no 
suitable item could be found, the procedure is repeated again and 
again until it finds an item. We are sure that an item is found, 
because the program selects already known problems for 
repetition with a p=15%. If all items are signed with 2 the student 
will receive this information together with an option to finish. The 
student may proceed with the training if preferred so. 

4. Algorithm overview 
Finally a short overview of the workflow (algorithm) is given: 

1. Pretest (see section  3.2, figure 2) 
2. Calculate the degree of competence (see 3.4) 
3. Choose next question according to the degree of 

competence (See section 3.5). For this, the probability to 
choose a question out of the three classes is (could be 
adjusted): 

o 75% learning area 
o 10% known questions 
o 5% well-known questions 

4. Process the given answer (See section 3.2) 
5. Calculate new degree of competence (See section 3.4) 

76



6. Check if learning progress is finished. If yes output a 
message to the user otherwise go to step 3. Repeat the 
algorithm until the user stops playing. 

5. Prototype 
The program is implemented as a game. Learners can earn points 
for each correct answer given and reach new stages (called rank). 
Points are gathered or can be lost if the answer given was wrong. 
Furthermore the answering speed is also important. The quicker a 
question is answered correctly the more points are gained. Finally 
the game requites also consecutive correct answers by giving 
more points. 

The prototype is a web application currently available following 
the URL (last visited October 2011): http://vlpc01.tu-
graz.ac.at/~georg/index.php/user/login. 

After registering an account learners are able to login. Depending 
on the learner’s user type they are redirected to the according 
page. The learners will get the main game interface (see figure 3). 
Administrators will see an additional navigation bar, which allows 
choosing between getting statistical information about all existing 
learners and simply playing the game. Due to the fact that it is a 
first prototype the interface is kept simple with a first design 
suggestion. 

 

Figure 3 Main screen of the application 

 

Figure 3 displays the main game interface (currently only a 
German version is running). The markers 1 to 6 refer to the most 
important areas of the interface: 

1. The questions which have to be answered (item of the 
multiplication table) 

2. Free space for feedback to the user, for example 
“Correct answer”, “Wrong answer” or “Not entered a 
number” 

3. Input field for providing the answer. It can be submitted 
by clicking on the green button “Antworten” or pressing 
“Enter” on the keyboard. 

4. The timeline shows the remaining time for giving an 
answer. Actually the learner has 60 seconds to answer 
(predefined by the teacher). Depending on the 
answering speed points are calculated. 

5. Shows the actual rank of the user. 
6. Displays the actual points of the learner. Of course the 

more points a learner gets, the higher is their rank. 

6. Study 
After finishing the web application the first research study was 
carried out at a primary school in Austria. In summer semester 

2011 the program was handed out to 42 pupils of the primary 
school Laubegg6 (age: 9-10). After a short introduction of the 
main principles of the program and setting personal accounts for 
each learner the study was started. It lasted at least 4 weeks. Some 
of the learners ignored this time restriction and played the game 
again and again over months. Learners learned on computers at 
the school as well as on their personal computers at home. It can 
be summarized that in the time frame of the study 12.926 answers 
where given which means that on average each learner answered 
308 questions or in summary they did the whole multiplication 
table 3,4 times. Bearing in mind that there was no real pressure 
from teacher’s side using the program it is a considerable pleasant 
high number. Furthermore it can be stated that pupils seemed to 
enjoy using the application or at least got not bored. 

7. Discussion 

7.1 General Overview 
First of all an overview of the general result is given (figure 4) by 
displaying the number of trials versus the final number of well-
known items. 

In detail figure 4 shows that in summary 18 learners (43%) 
mastered every 90 single multiplications at least twice (to get 
marked 2) of the multiplication tables. Many of them obviously 
enjoyed the game: One of them solved even 1.486 assignments on 
voluntary basis. 

If learners make no mistakes, they need approximately 190 trials 
to show their competence for each item and get marked “well-
known” (2). According to our defined algorithm and due to the 
fact that the probability of getting a correctly solved item twice in 
the very first beginning of the game is only about 10% the number 
of 190 trials seems to be a quite solid one. 

More than half of the learners are below the aspired 90 correct 
single multiplications of the multiplication tables. There might be 
several reasons for this:  

The learner 

• did not get used to / has problems with the interface 

• does not know the necessary operations; is not able to 
solve the learning problem correctly 

• misinterprets an assignment 

• is distracted by their environment and makes wrong 
clicks  

• is badly concentrated for several reasons. 

As mentioned before, six learners proceed to work with the 
program, even after the program offered to stop because every 
assignment had been answered correctly twice. In such cases, the 
program serves as a diagnostic instrument: It is more reliable than 
a paper-pencil test when a learner masters the multiplication table 
with this application.

Figure 4 Well-known items versus trials 

 

As mentioned before, more than half of the learners did not reach 
the 100 percent level. We already listed possible reasons why a 
learner does not solve the assignments correctly. Besides these 
arguments, it is necessary to reflect whether weaker learners could 
have fewer possibilities using the program, especially at home. 
The above-mentioned “high-trial” learner for example is known as 
someone who was able to train and use the program also at home. 
Eventually, the better students had more chances to work at the 
computers in classes, so that the teachers were able to work with 
weaker learners. Perhaps, learners with worse performances had 
general problems, like to open and to handle the program. 
Nevertheless, these are only further assumptions, which must be 
considered in future studies. 

7.2 Demotivated learner (ID 21) 
One learner with a weak performance attracted our attention 
because of a very high number of trials (513) (figure 5). A 
detailed inspection showed that she/he did not work very 
intensively. In the first two tasks he/she failed, then eleven tasks 
were ok, her/his performance rose abruptly. However, afterwards, 
she/he continued approximately 400 times to wait the whole 
answering time without doing anything but asking for a new 
assignment. 

 

Figure 5 Unmotivated performance 

7.3 Motivated captain 
Figure 6 shows the learning history of the most diligent learner. In 
the beginning, the assignments were solved correctly, then some 
mistakes occurred, afterwards a learning process can be 
recognized and finally with some occasional mistakes the learner 
works on a high performance level. Obviously, the learner was 
highly motivated to deal with the assignments given by the 
program: She/he absolutely wanted to be and stay the first in the 
high score. Furthermore there are an amazing high number of 
trials, which leads to the assumption that the learner likes to do 
the exercises. It seems that there is a dependence between the high 
number of trials and the almost perfect knowledge of the learning 
field.  

 

Figure 6 Motivated captain 

Teachers have to face such situations. Why did the learner 
become demotivated? Why did he/she did not proceed going on 
with learning and gave up? This case is quite dramatic, because 
the learner her/himself disrupted the ongoing learning process. 

7.4 The medium learner (ID 115) 
One of the most interesting learning histories can be seen in figure 
7. It points out the way the application works if a learner is not 
performing very well. In the beginning, the learner made mistakes 
in every second assignment (0,5), followed by 7 mistakes 
consecutively. This is the reason for the big decrease (0,15). 
Afterwards, the learner gave a number of right answers and the 
rate of correct answers increased back to 0,5.  In the following 
phase an up and down can be seen till a number of right 
consecutive answers helps to reach a level of 0,7. But then the 
number of mistakes rose again and the rate went down to about 
0.5. This characteristic curve illustrates how a learner is learning 
from mistakes and is getting better by failing an assignment and 
slowly solving it next time - “learning by failing”.

Figure 7 The medium learner 

This effect can be seen more detailed in figure 8; it shows the 
learning rate 2 of the same student. As mentioned in previous 
chapters an item is marked as 2 if it was solved at least twice 
consecutively. In the initial phase the same items are not 
presented very often due to the fact that the probability is defined 
with 15% (see chapter 4) and because the program prefers 
assignments that were not correctly answered beforehand. 
Afterwards, the performance increases fast to a certain stage (20 
items are marked as 2) and falls a little bit (“learning by failing”). 
The next 140 questions caused a so to say sideward trend; the 
student answered some questions right some wrong. Then the 
curve jumped up. The student has learned the solutions of a more 
difficult group of items, we do not know whether they got training 
beside the program or not. It needed about 120 questions more 
until the curve was growing again to foster the learning efforts. 
Finally we see that the last 15 assignments obviously lastingly 
cause some problems. It can be concluded that the learner needs 
just some additional time or other exercises and materials to 
perform the whole multiplication table perfectly. 

 

Figure 8 Unsteady and slow growing learning curve 

Figure 9 – the learning rate 1 of the student – underlines the 
“learning by failing” effect. There were about 300 trials almost 
every problem is signed as known (one time) - but only 20 items 
are signed as well-known (2 times). Furthermore in about 20 
percent of the items marked as “well-known” mistakes occurred 
(figure 8). Finally, the learner seems to be concentrated better or 
they learned the tables and solved 70 of the 90 items twice. 

 

Figure 9 Learning rate – the DOC 

 

7.5 The weak learner 
Figure 10 illustrates the exercise list of one learner, who had 
performed easy questions with simple assignments, but got worse 
afterwards, when the difficulty of the questions jumped over their 
degree of competence. We call the effect the “fast increase 
effect”, which means the increase is too fast and not appropriate to 
the learner’s knowledge.  

 

Figure 10 „Fast increase effect“ 

The learning rate curve of the same learner in figure 11 describes 
the same behavior:  a fast increase followed by a very unstable 
phase and decreasing output. In comparison to the case before, the 
learner is only able to manage about 25 percent of all items 
correctly. It is assumable that the learner is not mastering the 
whole multiplication table. By all means, they work with the 
program, make mistakes, are corrected, learn and for sure need 
much more time to master all items finally.

7.6 Lazy bones 
Figure 12 illustrates the learning curve of lazy learners because of 
the very little activity in relation to the competence. Of about 100 
problems 80% were solved. We need more precise observation, 
what is going on there. Is it a problem, that these students need an 
additional (social) motivation? The process is very slow and the 
performance is not good in this test situation. Could some other 
problems be the cause for this lack?

7.7 General remarks 
We think it is useful to test and to train the students with such 
programs. They have possibilities to get “out of the stream” with 
provocations to learn, which is the same in a normal class. But 
here we have a protocol of learning progress. In every case the 
delivered tasks are more frequent and more precisely orientated 
on the individual level and next reachable tasks than in a standard 
situation, with a teacher without such an information-processing 
capacity tool.  

8. Conclusion and future work 
In this publication we discuss the implementation of a new and 
intelligent algorithm to assist school children training one of the 
basic learning goals in primary schools – the multiplication table. 
Furthermore a field study with 42 learners was carried out and 
analyzed. The power of learning analytics allows the research 
team to think about the outcomes and carries out different types of 
learning curves.  

In general we can state that there are some major types of curves – 
learners who are very knowledgeable, those who are in a stage 
close to being knowledgeable and those who still need a lot of 
learning effort to reach the learning goals. However it is 
recognized that analyzing just one curve (correct answers/total 
number of process items) is not sufficient enough to cover the 
state of the learning process in most of the provided cases. There 
is a need to have a look at learning rate 1 and 2 too. Moreover 
sometimes the curves gave the researchers and teachers only a 
hint that a pedagogical intervention is absolutely necessary to 
enhance the learning results. 

For our future work we consider a couple of ideas how the current 
application can be improved, but mainly it must be stated that 
there should be a much closer look at the learners. This can 
perhaps be done in some more intelligent analyses of the data or 
in more cooperation with the teacher. We will have to analyze the 
reasons why some learners are demotivated or why their learning 
rate decreases during longer intervals. We also discussed whether 

it could be more appropriate to change the design from gaming to 
a more informative display of the actual knowledge. This could be 
a matrix, which displays the results with the 0,1 or 2 signs. In the 
future we also need a better aggregation, compression and 
visualization of the learning outcomes.  This could indicate those 
people, who need more attention from the teacher and probably 
immediate interventions. Another point is that we measured the 
time to solve the questions only to limit the time but not to 
construct additional aspects of the learning behavior.  

Overall we are convinced that the application is a further step 
towards an interesting learning future. The teacher saves time for 
management. Analyzing learners’ results and performance over a 
longer time period brings more reliable and systematical insights 
to teachers for their daily work in classrooms and improve the 
learning success of each learner. Nevertheless learning is a highly 
social process and is an active process on the part of the learner, 
where knowledge and understanding is constructed by the learner. 
With other words the implemented tools will help teachers to get a 
better feeling about the individual learning process and allow a 
just-in-time reaction.

Laubegg (Styria, Austria) as well as all participating school 
children.  

We are equally indebted to our funding agency “Internet 
Foundation Austria (IPA)” for supporting our ideas and helping us 
to work on the future of education.
