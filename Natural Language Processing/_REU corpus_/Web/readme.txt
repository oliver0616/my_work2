The conversion has few mapping error that program can't map few characters to, due to error the file has been organize 
to two folders:
Good: files that are completely fine or files that has less than 10 character missing
Error: files that has more than 10 character missing or couldnt not converted(it would be a .pdf file under the year folder)

The conversion do not incldue the tables and pictures
The easiest way to look for missing character is to search for question mark "?" in the file(charcter that could not be 
map to are replace by the question mark"?", use contorl f to search for them)
