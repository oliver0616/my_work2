abstract = {Automatic text analysis systems can lexically recognize a word only if it already exists in the electronic dictionary. The same thing is true for the NOOJ system analysis programs. One understands here by electronic dictionaries the lexical databases where all information is explicit because they are intended for computer programs use. These bases aim at the modelling of the language, which distinguishes them from the electronic lexicons created for particular applications needs. For technical languages or of specialty, work remains to be made to build dictionaries. Our work applies to the NOOJ system, with for immediate objective the installation of an electronic dictionary of French computer science terms (compound words), with an aim of analysing, automatically indexing texts. The linguistic aspects of the terminology are retained.},

abstract = {This study investigated the technical vocabulary of computer science in order to create a Computer Science Word List (CSWL). The CSWL was intended as a pedagogical tool in the instruction of non-native English speakers who are studying computer science in UK universities. In order to create this technical word list, a corpus of 3,661,337 tokens was compiled from journal articles and conference proceedings covering the 10 sub-disciplines of computer science as defined by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The CSWL was intended to be supplemental to both the General Service List (GSL) (West, 1953) and the Academic Word List (AWL) (Coxhead, 2000) and was created using the criteria established by Coxhead (2000) for word selection. The CSWL contained 433 headwords and in combination with the GSL and AWL accounted for 95.11\% of all tokens in the corpus. This was sufficient to meet the lexical threshold for sufficient understanding of a text as proposed by Laufer (1990). This study also conducted research into the technicality of the CSWL by comparison to other corpora, comparison to a technical dictionary and an investigation of the distribution of its headwords against the BNC frequency bands. Overall, the CSWL was found to be highly technical in nature. The final part of the research looked into the existence of multiword units in computer science literature to build a Computer Science Multi-Word List (CSMWL) from the same corpus. A total of 23 items comprised the CSMWL and they were again chosen using the same criteria of range and frequency as established by Coxhead (2000). The CSMWL showed that whilst multi-word units do exist in computer science literature, they are mostly compound nouns with domain specific meaning.},

Basics of Language for Language Learners, 2nd edition, by Peter W. Culicover and Elizabeth V. Hume, systematically explores all the aspects of language central to second language learning: the sounds of language, the different grammatical structures, the social functions of communication, and the psychology of language learning and use.
Unlike books specific to one single language, Basics of Language will help students of all languages. Readers will gain insight into the structure and use of their own language and will therefore see more clearly how the language they are learning differs from their first language. Language instructors will find the approach provocative, and the book will stimulate many new and effective ideas for teaching. Both a textbook and a reference work, Basics of Language will enhance the learning experience for anyone taking a foreign language course as well as the do-it-yourself learner.
A new section, ``Tools and Strategies for Language Learning,'' has been added to this second edition. It comprises three chapters that focus on brain training, memory and using a dictionary. In addition, the section ``Thinking Like a Native Speaker'' has been substantially updated to include more discussion of errors made by language learners.},
