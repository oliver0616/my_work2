This indispensable handbook covers both British and American English, and makes use of authentic spoken and written examples. Packed with tables, diagrams, and numerous example sentences, and assuming no prior knowledge of grammatical concepts on the part of the reader, this volume offers an unmatched guide to the structure of contemporary English. Arranged in three clear parts for ease of use, the Grammar's comprehensive coverage ranges from the very basic--such as word structure, simple and complex phrases, and clause types--to the more sophisticated topics that lie at the intersection of grammar and meaning, including tense and aspect, mood and modality, and information structuring. How do words formed by compounding differ from words formed by conversion? How many verbs in English can take a declarative clause functioning as direct object (i.e., decide that... or believe that...)? What is the relationship between a matrix clause and a subordinate clause? What is the present futurate? The past futurate? The present perfect? How does the grammar of English encode such semantic notions as possibility, probability, necessity, obligation, permission, intention, or ability? Aarts answers all these questions, clearly and engagingly, deeply enriching the reader's understanding of the English language. Oxford Modern English Grammar will be invaluable for those with an interest in the English language, undergraduate students of all disciplines, and for anyone who would like a clear guide to English grammar and how to use it."}

Moving away from the traditional intuitive approach to linguistics, which used made-up examples, corpus linguistics has made a significant contribution to all areas of the field. Until very recently, corpus linguistics has focused almost exclusively on syntax and the lexicon; however corpus-based approaches to the other subfields of linguistics are now rapidly emerging, and this is the first handbook on corpus pragmatics as a field. Bringing together a team of leading scholars from around the world, this handbook looks at how the use of corpus data has informed research into different key aspects of pragmatics, including pragmatic principles, pragmatic markers, evaluation, reference, speech acts, and conversational organization."}

Yet, although research into language has increased at a phenomenal rate over the last fifty years, misconceptions abound. This illuminating and highly readable collection of essays explores some of the myths, for example: standards of children's speech and writing have declined; women talk too much; the 'purity' of the English language is under threat; some languages are more attractive to the ear or are harder to learn than others; the media has a detrimental effect on language. These widely held views are questioned and shown to be based on inadequate or false information, or simply, not to be true. Other essays explore spelling problems, attitudes towards accents, controversies over changes in language, and the belief that some languages have no grammar. A unique collection of original essays by 21 of the world's leading linguists. The topics discussed focus on some of the most popular myths about language: The Media Are Ruining English; Children Can't Speak or Write Properly Anymore; America is Ruining the English Language. The tone is lively and entertaining throughout and there are cartoons from Doonesbury and The Wizard of Id to illustrate some of the points. The book should have a wide readership not only amongst students who want to read leading linguists writing about popular misconceptions but also amongst the large number of people who enjoy reading about language in general."}

Grounded in research, the book explains how to select words for instruction, introduce their meanings, and create engaging learning activities that promote both word knowledge and reading comprehension. The authors are trusted experts who draw on extensive experience in diverse classrooms and schools. Sample lessons and vignettes, children's literature suggestions, end-of-chapter summaries, and Your Turn learning activities enhance the book's utility as a classroom resource, professional development tool, or course text. One of the 10 Books Every Teacher Should Read Reflects over a decade of advances in research-based vocabulary instruction. Chapters on vocabulary and writing; assessment; and differentiating instruction for struggling readers and English language learners, including coverage of response to intervention (RTI). Expanded discussions of content-area vocabulary and multiple-meaning words. Many additional examples showing what robust instruction looks like in action. Appendix with a useful menu of instructional activities. See also the authors' Creating Robust Vocabulary: Frequently Asked Questions and Extended Examples, which includes specific instructional sequences for different grade ranges, as well as Making Sense of Phonics, Second Edition: The Hows and Whys, by Isabel L. Beck and Mark E. Beck, an invaluable resource for K-3. Bringing Words to Life is, without doubt, one of the best and most influential books ever published on the topic of teaching and developing vocabulary. The second edition is even better than the first--it addresses recent issues such as the Common Core and RTI; provides a greater number of helpful, practical examples; addresses vocabulary and writing; takes on the challenge of providing effective vocabulary instruction for struggling readers and English learners; and offers guidance for teaching math, science, and social studies vocabulary in the intermediate grades. This book should be required reading for anyone seeking teacher or reading specialist certification. This is a book teachers will read, reread, and refer to many times to nurture a love of language through joyful, robust vocabulary instruction. The authors' research-based insights and advice about selecting words and systematically presenting them to learners from all backgrounds are both practical and manageable. Teachers will delight in nurturing a language-rich classroom where students revel in language, read better and deeper, speak effectively, and write with purpose and clarity. It's hard to believe, but the second edition of Bringing Words to Life is even more comprehensive than the first. Beck, McKeown, and Kucan have outdone themselves. Containing real-life examples and easy-to-implement strategies, this book is a 'must have' for vocabulary instruction. It will help teachers greatly as they work to meet the Common Core Standards. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this book is its personal touch--reading it is like having a conversation with the authors about robust vocabulary instruction. The authors share their decision making, offer warnings about potential challenges, encourage thoughtful planning, and insist on follow-through. Teachers are amply supported in their learning by the 'Your Turn' and 'You Try It' features, whether working on their own or in a course on literacy instruction. This is a book designed by teachers for teachers. The book offers elementary, middle, and high school teachers concrete suggestions for choosing words and teaching them to students. New chapters in the second edition provide important updates for teachers who are data driven, who have students of varying ability levels and language backgrounds, and who focus on the reading-writing connection. Like the first edition, this book will make a significant contribution to teacher preparation and professional development. Specific recommendations for practice are illustrated with detailed examples of teachers implementing robust vocabulary instruction in their classrooms. Isabel L.

Three analytical approaches are introduced and compared, describing a wide range of texts from the perspectives of register, genre and style. The primary focus of the book is on the analysis of registers. Part 1 introduces an analytical framework for studying registers, genre conventions, and styles. Part 2 provides detailed descriptions of particular text varieties in English, including spoken interpersonal varieties (conversation, university office hours, service encounters), written varieties (newspapers, academic prose, fiction), and emerging electronic varieties (e-mail, internet forums, text messages). Finally, Part 3 introduces advanced analytical approaches using corpora, and discusses theoretical concerns, such as the place of register studies in linguistics, and practical applications of register analysis. Each chapter ends with three types of activities: reflection and review activities, analysis activities, and larger project ideas. This outstanding and highly accessible guide should definitely be useful to students of linguistics and language teachers who may wish to incorporate textual analyses in their teaching. Particularly, the volume can be used as a textbook for courses on register, genre, and style in applied English programs worldwide. clearly, the information presented in this practice-oriented volume has been compiled through years of work and research and serves as an essential reading for those interested in the analysis of registers and other related textual studies."}

Applications of the compendium to historical linguistics are proposed. For example, the catalog of correspondences and frequencies facilitates objective assessment of the commonness or rarity of shared phonological innovations cited as evidence for language-family subgrouping. In another analysis, correspondence frequency is used to measure the degree of similarity between different sounds, yielding models for classifying consonants and vowels that substantially agree with articulatory properties. Correspondence-based similarities are also compared with measurements of sound similarity involving factors such as perceptual confusions, speech errors, and cooccurrence patterns in synchronic phonological rules. Sound similarity discerned from both the perception and production of speech is found to correlate to about the same extent with correspondence-based similarities."}

Instead of dismissing the practice of ‘verbal hygiene’, as a misguided and pernicious exercise, she argues that popular discourse about language values – good and bad, right and wrong – serves an important function for those engaged in it. A series of case studies deal with specific examples of verbal hygiene: the regulation of ‘style’ by editors, the teaching of English grammar in schools, the movements for and against so-called ‘politically correct’ language and the advice given to women on how they can speak more effectively. This Routledge Linguistics Classic includes a new foreword which looks at how the issues covered in the case studies have developed over time and a new afterword which discusses new concerns which have emerged in the last 15 years, from the regimentation of language in the workplace to panics about immigration and terrorism, which are expressed in linguistic terms. Addressed to linguists, to professional language-users of all kinds, and to anyone interested in language and culture, Verbal Hygiene calls for legitimate concerns about language and value to be discussed, by experts and lay-speakers alike, in a rational and critical spirit."}

Full facsimile of the original edition. Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. American linguist Paul Postal wrote in 1964 that most of the syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States were versions of the theory of phrase structure grammars in the sense of Chomsky. British linguist John Lyons wrote in 1966 that no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's Syntactic Structures. Prominent historian of linguistics R. H. Robins wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's Syntactic Structures was probably the most radical and important change in direction in descriptive linguistics and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years. Another historian of linguistics Frederick Newmeyer considers Syntactic Structures revolutionary for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a formal yet non-empiricist theory of language was possible and more importantly, it demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of English grammar. Secondly, it put syntax at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. As a result, morphology and phonology were relegated in importance. Syntactic Structures also initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between philosophers of language and linguists. American philosopher John Searle wrote that Chomsky's work is one of the most remarkable intellectual achievements of the present era, comparable in scope and coherence to the work of Keynes or Freud. It has done more than simply produce a revolution in linguistics; it has created a new discipline of generative grammar and is having a revolutionary effect on two other subjects, philosophy and psychology. With its formal and logical treatment of language, Syntactic Structures also brought linguistics and the new field of computer science closer together. Chomsky's book on syntactic structures is one of the first serious attempts on the part of a linguist to construct within the tradition of scientific theory-construction a comprehensive theory of language which may be understood in the same sense that a chemical, biological theory is ordinarily understood by experts in those fields. It is not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalog, nor another speculative philosophy about the nature of Man and Language, but rather a rigorous explication of our intuitions about our language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages; and it may well provide an opportunity for the application of explicit measures of simplicity to decide preference of one form over another form of grammar.Robert B. Lees in: 'Language' I had already decided I wanted to be a linguist when I discovered this book. But it is unlikely that I would have stayed in the field without it. It has been the single most inspiring book on linguistics in my whole career. Chomsky's book on syntactic structures is one of the first serious attempts on the part of a linguist to construct within the tradition of scientific theory-construction a comprehensive theory of language which may be understood in the same sense that a chemical, biological theory is ordinarily understood by experts in those fields. It is not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalog, nor another speculative philosophy about the nature of Man and Language, but rather a rigorous explication of our intuitions about our language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages; and it may well provide an opportunity for the application of explicit measures of simplicity to decide preference of one form over another form of grammar."}

Christiansen and Nick Chater","title":"Creating Language: Integrating Evolution, Acquisition, and Processing","publisher":"The MIT Press","address":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","year":"2016","isbn":"978-0262034319","keywords":"Language, Book","abstract":"Language is a hallmark of the human species; the flexibility and unbounded expressivity of our linguistic abilities is unique in the biological world. In this book, Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater argue that to understand this astonishing phenomenon, we must consider how language is created: moment by moment, in the generation and understanding of individual utterances; year by year, as new language learners acquire language skills; and generation by generation, as languages change, split, and fuse through the processes of cultural evolution. Christiansen and Chater propose a revolutionary new framework for understanding the evolution, acquisition, and processing of language, offering an integrated theory of how language creation is intertwined across these multiple timescales. Christiansen and Chater argue that mainstream generative approaches to language do not provide compelling accounts of language evolution, acquisition, and processing. Their own account draws on important developments from across the language sciences, including statistical natural language processing, learnability theory, computational modeling, and psycholinguistic experiments with children and adults. Christiansen and Chater also consider some of the major implications of their theoretical approach for our understanding of how language works, offering alternative accounts of specific aspects of language, including the structure of the vocabulary, the importance of experience in language processing, and the nature of recursive linguistic structure. Our understanding of language -- its evolution, acquisition, and processing -- is undergoing a seismic shift and this engaging, ambitious book clarifies and motivates the new exciting landscape. This book is unique in its attempt to take a usage-based and unified approach to the sciences of language: its evolution, historical change, processing, and acquisition. It covers an extraordinarily wide range of relevant and up-to-date literature from which it builds an important theoretical approach. It provides the foundation for asking all the fundamental questions in language research. Christiansen and Chater's Creating Language presents a compelling account of how acquisition and processing mutually constrain one another in shaping both linguistic performance and the nature of language. Then, to top it off, they fearlessly touch the linguistic third rail, language evolution, and the time scales shift from milliseconds and months, to millennia. The book will excite controversy, but it most certainly will excite."}

Adopting an approach to the subject pioneered by Greenberg and others, Bernard Comrie is particularly concerned with syntactico-semantic universals, devoting chapters to word order, case making, relative clauses, and causative constructions. His book is informed throughout by the conviction that an exemplary account of universal properties of human language cannot restrict itself to purely formal aspects, nor focus on analysis of a single language. Rather, it must also consider language use, relate formal properties to testable claims about cognition and cognitive development, and treat data from a wide range of languages. This second edition has been revised and updated to take full account of new research in universals and typology in the past decade, and more generally to consider how the approach advocated here relates to recent advances in generative grammatical theory. This book is excellent and should be in every linguist's library. The author follows Greenberg rather than Chomsky in his approach to language universals. You do need some knowledge of linguistics in order to appreciate the book. Bernard Comrie is chair of the department of linguistics at the University of Southern California. He is the author of many publications including Aspect and Tense, and is editor of Studies in Language."}

Culicover","title":"Principles and Parameters: An Introduction to Syntactic Theory","publisher":"Oxford University Press","address":"Oxford, UK","year":"1997","isbn":"978-0198700142","keywords":"Book, Syntax","abstract":"This authoritative survey shows readers how specific methodological assumptions underlie the core analyses on which syntactic theory is based. The author, an internationally respected figure in the field, gives extensive treatment of Government and Binding (GB) theory and summarizes the major proposals and results of Case theory, Theta theory, X' theory, Binding theory, the theory of A- and A' movement, locality conditions, and the theory of Logical Form (LF). He also provides an up-to-date introduction to a number of more recent proposals, including Chomsky's Minminalist Program, Larsonian Shells, and Kaynes's Antisymmetry theory. The most coherent and organized account of syntactic theory currently available, this volume is enhanced by carefully selected and extensive sets of exercises, annotated suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter, and a comprehensive glossary of technical terms. I have used this book, along with other similar sources, for writing a parametric grammar of Persian.The book is coherently organized into ten chapters: 1. Foundations Methods, Arguments, 2. Government and Case, 3. Binding Theory, 4. A-Movement, 5. X'-Theory, 6. A'-Movement, 7. Barriers, 8. LF Representation, 9. Binding and Logical Form. 10. Head Movement and Minimalism. Beginning with the second chapter the author picks up a syntactic problem and critically examines the solutions offered by linguists. For instance,in chapter four he concentrates on the analysis of the passive and its properties, namely, the movement of the underlying object into the surface subject position of the sentence in terms of a lexical analysis, a movement hypothesis and a chain relationship. Moreover, at the end of each chapter there are ample exercises from various languages ( except Persian, of course) for readers/ students to ponder over. Crucially,readers/students can familiarize themselves with current linguistic as well as syntactic issues and their proposed solutions. Nevertheless, the book suffers from a couple of drawbacks concerning the ultimate plausible solution for each problem and, more significantly, the definition of principles and parameters as a theoretical foundation/ approach selected by the author,as the title suggests. I consider the latter a critical issue because there seems to be a fair degree of consensus among researchers concerning the principles which describe universal properties of grammatical operations or structures. However, differences of opinions arise regarding the parameters and the components of the language in which they have to be found. According to Chomsky, parameters are associated with the principles of Universal Grammar. Other linguists attribute them to the inflectional system of the language, the fictional categories or lexical categories in general. From this book one cannot understand the author's position on the theory of parametrization. Since Chomsky established the GB model in the early 1980's, many introductory books have been published. Culicover's book came out by the end of the GB fashion when most people were attracted by Chomsky's new ideas of the minimalist program (MP). However, this book is not out of date at all, since Culicover illustrated the GB theory in a very critical way providing with quite a number of problems which cannot be solved at ease within the GB framework. All those problems are interesting issues that generative syntax has to manage. Though the author gave some suggestions, the issues remained open both to the GB framework and the MP followers. After reading this book, you may realize that the GB model is not as good as most people believe and that the burden of the MP will be heavier when it has to take over what left insolvable in the GB.

The efforts have been institutionalized in places such as usage guides, dictionaries, and school curricula. Such authorities have aspired to 'fix' the language, sometimes by keeping English exactly where it is, but also by trying to improve the current state of the language. Anne Curzan demonstrates the important role prescriptivism plays in the history of the English language, as a sociolinguistic factor in language change and as a vital meta-discourse about language. Starting with a pioneering new definition of prescriptivism as a linguistic phenomenon, she highlights the significant role played by Microsoft's grammar checker, debates about 'real words', non-sexist language reform, and efforts to reappropriate stigmatized terms. Essential reading for anyone interested in the regulation of language, the book is a fascinating re-examination of how we tell language history."}

In sorting out the various senses in which the word word is used, it asserts that three concepts which have often been identified with each other are in fact distinct and not coextensive: listemes (linguistic objects permanently stored by the speaker); morphological objects (objects whose shape can be characterized in morphological terms of affixation and compounding); and syntactic atoms (objects that are unanalyzable units with respect to syntax). The first chapter defends the idea that listemes are distinct from the other two notions, and that all one can and should say about them is that they exist. A theory of morphological objects is developed in chapter two. Chapter three defends the claim that the morphological objects are a proper subset of the syntactic atoms, presenting the authors' reconstruction of the important and much-debated Lexical Integrity Hypothesis. A final chapter shows that there are syntactic atoms which are not morphological objects. Anne Marie Di Sciullo is in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Quebec.

GMEU is the liveliest and most compulsively readable reference work for writers of our time. It delights while providing instruction on skillful, persuasive, and vivid writing. Garner liberates English from two extremes: both from the hidebound purists who mistakenly believe that split infinitives and sentence-ending prepositions are malfeasances and from the linguistic relativists who believe that whatever people say or write must necessarily be accepted. The judgments here are backed up not just by a lifetime of study but also by an empirical grounding in the largest linguistic corpus ever available. In this fourth edition, Garner has made extensive use of corpus linguistics to include ratios of standard terms as compared against variants in modern print sources. No other resource provides as comprehensive, reliable, and empirical a guide to current English usage. For all concerned with writing and editing, GMEU will prove invaluable as a desk reference. Garner illustrates with actual examples, cited with chapter and verse, all the linguistic blunders that modern writers and speakers are prone to, whether in word choice, syntax, phrasing, punctuation, or pronunciation.

Some are basic like men, women, and children or abstract nouns like trauma and violence; others describe qualities such as hot, hard, and rough, emotions like happiness and sadness, or feelings like pain. They ground their discussions in real examples from different cultures and draw on work ranging from Leibniz, Locke, and Bentham, to popular works such as autobiographies and memoirs, and the Dalai Lama on happiness. The book opens with a review of the neglected status of lexical semantics in linguistics.

Building on the work of French linguist Gustave Guillaume, Making Sense out of Meaning is a speaker-oriented study that describes how speakers form word meaning and not, as in other theories, how listeners interpret the meaning of what they hear. Hirtle develops a general model of the ways in which words and word meaning may be realized in discourse contexts and addresses such issues as the demarcation of polysemy and monosemy, metaphorical meaning, parts of speech, and the concept of conversion or zero derivation. Bringing together both lexical and grammatical components, Hirtle shows that distinct lexical senses can be observed and their relations can be understood by focusing on speakers' use of verbs and nouns. A methodical and thoughtful work, Making Sense out of Meaning situates its central question by recalling traditional views of language's relation to thought and argues for meaning as a valid object of scientific inquiry."}

The principal authors, Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey Pullum, are among the world's leading scholars in this area, and they have benefited from the expertise of an international team of distinguished contributors in preparing what will be the definitive grammar for decades to come. Each chapter comprises core definitions, detailed analyses, notes explaining alternative interpretations of difficult or controversial points, and brief notes on usage and history. Numerous cross-references and an exhaustive index ensure ease of access to information. An introductory section offers guidance as to how best to use the book is provided. Rodney Huddleston was until recently Professor in the Linguistics section of the Department of English at the University of Queensland, Australia, and has been publishing important books and papers on English grammar for thirty years. Geoffrey K. Pullum is Professor of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is the author of 200 articles and books on English grammar and a variety of other topics in theoretical and applied linguistics. Although the title may suggest that this is a usage manual or style guide, it is actually a reference work that, in the authors' words, aims to outline and illustrate the principles that govern the construction of words and sentences ... without recommending or condemning particular usage choices. With help from an impressive group of international scholars, linguistics professors Huddleston (English Grammar: An Outline) and Pullum (Phonetic Symbol Guide) here provide a comprehensive and detailed look at the principles of the English language. Chapters are divided into several subsections, with ample examples and explanations for each concept; both a conceptual and a lexical index are included. Although the writers attempt to bridge a gap...between traditional grammar and the partial descriptions of English grammar proposed by those working in the field of linguistics, the book leans heavily toward the field of linguistics. This makes it more accessible to the informed student of linguistics than to the simple lover of the English language. It is nevertheless an authoritative addition to the fields of both English grammar and linguistics. Recommended for all academic libraries."}

The notion of 'pattern' as a systematic way of dealing with the interface between lexis and grammar was used in Collins Cobuild English Dictionary (1995) and in the two books in the Collins Cobuild Grammar Patterns series (1996; 1998). This volume describes the research that led to these publications, and explores the theoretical and practical implications of the research. The first chapter sets the work in the context of work on phraseology. The next two chapters give several examples of patterns and how they are identified. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss and exemplify the association of pattern and meaning. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 relate the concept of pattern to traditional approaches to grammar and to discourse. Chapter 9 summarizes the book and adds to the theoretical discussion, as well as indicating the applications of this approach to language teaching. The volume is intended to contribute to the current debate concerning how corpora challenge existing linguistic theories, and as such will be of interest to researchers in the fields of grammar, lexis, discourse and corpus linguistics. It is written in an accessible style, however, and will be equally suitable for students taking courses in those areas."}

The scientific problems within present linguistics, the book contends, combine with social problems of the society in which linguists participate to press linguistics to discover ethnographic foundations. The work of providing such foundations largely remains to be done. Working out the implications of these three principles requires a new mode of description of linguistic features and relationships, a mode which can treat the verbal means of a community as a part of its organization of communicative means. In Part One, Dell Hymes indicates the place of linguistic inquiry as part of an inquiry into communicable conduct in general. Part Two demonstrates the mutual relation between linguistics and other disciplines that contribute to the common larger field -- sociology, social anthropology, education, folklore, and poetics are discussed. In Part Three the author argues that problems within linguistic inquiry suggest social foundations of linguistics deeper than presently assumed, such that social meaning and stylistic function must be taken into account systematically, and social life seen as a source of the organization of linguistic means."}

This book presents a rhetorical model of pragmatics: that is, a model which studies linguistic communication in terms of communicative goals and principles of 'good communicative behavior'. In this respect, Geoffrey Leech argues for a rapprochement between linguistics and the traditional discipline of rhetoric. He does not reject the Chomskovan revolution of linguistics, but rather maintains that the language system in the abstract - i.e. the 'grammar' broadly in Chomsky's sense - must be studied in relation to a fully developed theory of language use. There is therefore a division of labor between grammar and rhetoric, or (in the study of meaning) between semantics and pragmatics. The book's main focus is thus on the development of a model of pragmatics within an overall functional model of language. In this it builds on the speech act theory of Austin and Searle, and the theory of conversational implicature of Grice, but at the same time enlarges pragmatics to include politeness, irony, phatic communion, and other social principles of linguistic behavior."}

This was enabled by remarkable strides in natural language processing (NLP) technology, technology that enables computers to automatically and efficiently process, annotate and analyze large amounts of spoken and written text in linguistically and/or pragmatically meaningful ways. It has become more desirable than ever before for language and linguistics researchers who use corpora in their research to gain an adequate understanding of the relevant NLP technology to take full advantage of its capabilities. This volume provides language and linguistics researchers with an accessible introduction to the state-of-the-art NLP technology that facilitates automatic annotation and analysis of large text corpora at both shallow and deep linguistic levels. The book covers a wide range of computational tools for lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and discourse analysis, together with detailed instructions on how to obtain, install and use each tool in different operating systems and platforms. The book illustrates how NLP technology has been applied in recent corpus-based language studies and suggests effective ways to better integrate such technology in future corpus linguistics research. This book provides language and linguistics researchers with a valuable reference for corpus annotation and analysis.

It not only gives information about the language as a whole, but also about the differences between spoken and written English, and between different spoken and written varieties of the language. The frequencies are derived from a wide ranging and up-to-date corpus of English: the British National Corpus, which was compiled from over 4,000 written texts and spoken transcriptions representing the present day language in the UK. The book is based on a new version of the corpus (available from 2001) providing more accurate grammatical information, which is essential (for example) for distinguishing words like leaves (noun) and leaves (verb) with different meanings. The book begins with a general introduction, explaining why such information is important and highlighting interesting linguistic findings that emerge from the statistical analysis of the British National Corpus vocabulary. It also contains twenty four 'interest boxes' which highlight and comment on different aspects of frequency - for example, the most common colour words in English in order of frequency, and a comparison of male words (e.g. man) and female words (e.g. woman) in terms of their frequency."}

Introducing English Linguistics accomplishes this goal in two ways. First, it takes a top-down approach to language, beginning with the largest unit of linguistic structure, the text, and working its way down through successively smaller structures (sentences, words, and finally speech sounds). The advantage of presenting language this way is that students are first given the larger picture - they study language in context - and then see how the smaller pieces of language are a consequence of the larger goals of linguistic communication. Second, the book does not contain invented examples, as is the case with most comparable texts, but instead takes its sample materials from the major computerized databases of spoken and written English, giving students a more realistic view of language."}

Anaphora and coreference resolution both refer to the process of linking textual phrases (and, consequently, the information attached to them) within as well as across sentence boundaries, and to the same discourse referent. The book offers an overview of recent research advances, focusing on practical, operational approaches and their applications. In part I (Background), it provides a general introduction, which succinctly summarizes the linguistic, cognitive, and computational foundations of anaphora processing and the key classical rule- and machine-learning-based anaphora resolution algorithms. Acknowledging the central importance of shared resources, part II (Resources) covers annotated corpora, formal evaluation, preprocessing technology, and off-the-shelf anaphora resolution systems. Part III (Algorithms) provides a thorough description of state-of-the-art anaphora resolution algorithms, covering enhanced machine learning methods as well as techniques for accomplishing important subtasks such as mention detection and acquisition of relevant knowledge. Part IV (Applications) deals with a selection of important anaphora and coreference resolution applications, discussing particular scenarios in diverse domains and distilling a best-practice model for systematically approaching new application cases. In the concluding part V (Outlook), based on a survey conducted among the contributing authors, the prospects of the research field of anaphora processing are discussed, and promising new areas of interdisciplinary cooperation and emerging application scenarios are identified. Given the book's design, it can be used both as an accompanying text for advanced lectures in computational linguistics, natural language engineering, and computer science, and as a reference work for research and independent study. It addresses an audience that includes academic researchers, university lecturers, postgraduate students, advanced undergraduate students, industrial researchers, and software engineers."}

It gives an overview of theoretical concepts and descriptive devices. The discussion is based on varieties of English (Modern Standard, Belfast, Shakespearean, Jamaican Creole) and does not assume prior knowledge of syntax. There are exercises and a glossary. It is an abridged version of Radford's major new textbook Syntactic Theory and the Structure of English: A Minimalist Approach (CUP, 1997). Radford is well known for his comprehensible textbooks of generative syntax. This book is very helpful for beginners to get access to Chomsky's revolutionary ideas in his minimalist program (MP), which is radically different from his previous versions of grammar. What is the particular of this book is that the reader does not need to learn Chomsky's arguments starting from his early works. The book leads the reader to the MP in a straightforward way. The book first reviews Chomsky's philosophy of language, and then demonstrates the operation of the principles and parameters in the framework by using the examples which can explain our intuition of English. To reduce the burden of the reader, as he did in his other books, the author uses vivid analogies to illustrate some critical concepts. There are also excises attached to each chapter. Besides, the book includes a glossary of the terms which appear in the book. If you want to learn about the MP or to read Chomsky's latest works, or if you want to find a textbook for your students in the course of generative syntax, this book, I believe, as a warm-up candidate, should be under your consideration. Radford's writing is, as always, clear and illuminating. Radford introduces the rationale behind the Minimalist Program and then proceeds to walk the reader through a minimalist analysis of syntactic phenomena in English. His progression goes from elements possibly familiar from similar proposals in other versions of Generative Grammar to new and even polemic proposals. It is an outstanding overview for readers who may not wish to delve into the paraphernalia of constructs and concepts from obsolete prior proposals. Worthy of note is the fact that analysis of Early Modern English and Belfast English are used to contrast and complement Modern English analysis. I wish more scientists and professors had Radford's clarity!"}

As someone with only a general background in the field (but also possessing a deep love of syntactic theory), I consider myself to be a very good test subject. One of the book's strongest points is Radford's willingness to take the time and space necessary to explain each detailed step in a theory, derivation, etc. Although I did not need all of the detail all of the time, it was easy to skip those parts and move on. For those with VERY little background in syntactic theory, these carefully outlined steps will be quite helpful in understanding where Radford is taking the theories. Another item of importance is Radford's occasional display of alternate explanations for certain empirical paradigms. Although even more alternates would have been more satisfying to me, too many would have made the 550-page book too cumbersome for some. A third strong point for the book is its generous workbook sections, one for each chapter. In each section, the problems are carefully explained, and the examples are arranged in an order of progressive difficulty. By using the workbook sections, the student can much better grasp the ideas than by simply going over the chapter's supplied paradigms/answers. There are, however, a few drawbacks to be kept in mind. First, only the initial (and easiest) of the workbook section's problems typically is given an answer. For a student doing independent study (like me), or for one with a teacher who is inattentive to the workbook section, this poses a major problem in that difficulties cannot be easily rectified. To make matters more confusing, a few of the workbook problems address issues which are not directly commented on in the chapter. The other problem I noticed was the book's espousing certain ideas without any explanation thereof. For instance, the book subscribes to the binary merger theory but offers no real reasons for it (and also neglects to offer any current alternatives). This is not an argument against binary merger; I simply maintain that it would have been better for the reader to understand (even very basically) the author's reasoning behind this decision. Despite these two problems, however, I highly recommend this text to anyone wishing to enter into the academic world of theoretical syntax and explore many of its nuanced facets."}

A succinct and practical introduction to understanding sentence structure, ideal for students who need to get up to speed on key concepts in the field Introduces readers to the central terms and concepts in syntax Offers a hands-on approach to understanding and performing syntactic analysis and introduces students to linguistic argumentation Includes numerous problem sets, helpfully graded for difficulty, with model answers provided at critical points Prepares readers for more advanced work with syntactic systems and syntactic analyses Ultimately, I would argue that this book succeeds with its goals by laying a broad, basic, and clear foundation in the philosophy of generative syntax, thus allowing undergraduates to learn the nature of scientific inquiry with languages in a trimester/quarter system or supporting graduate students with little or distant background to read and respond to primary literature with more confidence and understanding. This succinct, practical introduction to understanding sentence structure is ideal for students with little background in linguistics who need to get up to speed on how modern syntactic analysis works. Introducing the reader to the central terms and concepts in the field of syntax, it explains how to understand and operate syntactic analysis, as well as how to approach linguistic argumentation. Included are numerous problem sets, helpfully graded for difficulty, with model answers provided at critical points. Designed for either classroom use or self-study, Syntactic Analysis fills a gap in the available literature by providing a short and hands-on guide to understanding syntactic systems, and provides the reader with a strong foundation for more advanced work in the field."}

It examines the directions and challenges of current research and shows how these reflect and inform work on the development of linguistic theory. It describes what typologists have revealed about language in general and discovered (and continue to discover) about the richly various ways in which meaning and expression are achieved in the world's languages. Typological research extends across all branches of linguistics. The degree to which the characteristics of language are universal or particular is crucial to the understanding of language and its relation to human nature and culture. This book is an essential source of reference for linguists of all theoretical persuasions. It is a vital companion for all those working in linguistic typology or undertaking linguistic fieldwork on one or more languages."}

Wierzbicka seeks to demonstrate that every language has key concepts, expressed in key words, which reflect the core values of a given culture. She shows that cultures can be revealingly studied, compared, and explained to outsiders through their key concepts, and that the analytical framework necessary for this purpose is provided by the natural semantic metalanguage, based on lexical universals, that the author and colleagues have developed on the basis of wide-ranging cross-linguistic investigations. Appealing to anthropologists, psychologists, and philosophers as well as linguists, this book demonstrates that cultural patterns can be studied in a verifiable, rigorous, and non-speculative way, on the basis of empirical evidence and in a coherent theoretical framework."}

The lexicons of different languages seem to suggest different conceptual universes. Investigating cultures from a universal, language-independent perspective, this book rejects analytical tools derived from the English language and Anglo culture and proposes instead a natural semantic metalanguage formulated in English words but based on lexical universals. The outcome of two and a half decades of research, the metalanguage is made up of universal semantic primitives in terms of which all meanings--including the most culture-specific ones--can be described and compared in a precise and illuminating way. Integrating insights from linguistics, cultural anthropology, and cognitive psychology, and written in simple, non-technical language, Semantics, Culture, and Cognition is accessible not only to scholars and students, but also to the general reader interested in semantics and the relationship between language and culture."}

It postulates that animals, people, even well designed machines will naturally choose the path of least resistance or effort. This is perhaps best known or at least documented among researchers in the field of library and information science. Their principle states that an information seeking client will tend to use the most convenient search method, in the least exacting mode available. Information seeking behavior stops as soon as minimally acceptable results are found. This theory holds true regardless of the user's proficiency as a searcher, or their level of subject expertise. The principle of least effort is analogous to the path of least resistance. The principle was studied by linguist George Kingsley Zipf, author of this classic treatment of the subject. He theorized that the distribution of word use was due to the tendency to communicate efficiently with least effort and this theory is known as Zipf's Law."}
