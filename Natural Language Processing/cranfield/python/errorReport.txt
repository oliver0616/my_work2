.I 240 .T a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow . .A dean r. chapman .B naca technote 3792 .W a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow .     the flow field analyzed consists of a thin, constant pressure viscous mixing layer separated from a solid surface by an enclosed region of low-velocity air (/dead air/) . the law of conservation of energy is employed to relate calculated conditions within the separated mixing layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solid surface . this physical speed is app ied to alminar separations in compressible flow for various prandtl numbers, including consideration of the case where air is injected into the separated region  . .A application to turbulent separations is made for a prandtl number of .B unity in low-speed flow without injection . all calculations are for the case of zero boundary-layer thickness at the position of separation .      for alminar separations the differential equations for viscous flow at arbitrary mach number are solved for the enthalpy and velocity profiles within the thin layer where mixing with dead air takes place . results are presented in tabular form for prandtl numbers between 0.1 and 10  . the rate of heat transfer to a separated laminar region in air laminar boundary layer having the same constant pressure . injection of gas into the separated region is calculated to have a powerful effect in reducing the rate of heat transfn  to the wall  . it is calculated that a moderate quantity of gas injection reduces to zero the heat transfer in a laminar separated flow .

.I 576 .T viscous and inviscid stagnation flow in a dissociated hypervelocity free  stream . .A inger, g.r. .B proc. 1962. heat transfer and fluid mech. inst . .W viscous and inviscid stagnation flow in a dissociated hypervelocity free  stream . high reynolds number hypersonic stagnation flow over a blunt-nosed body in a nonequilibrium dissociated free stream is analyzed and compared to a similar flow in an initially undissociated ambient gas . free stream dissociation effects on various equilibrium stagnation flow properties in air are presented as a function of the ambient atom mass fraction and  dissociation energy for velocities ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 fps . significant changes in the bow shock geometry, stagnation gas state, and  boundary layer behavior are found when the free stream dissociation involves more than 10( of the total energy . it is observed that for large amounts of both atomic oxygen and nitrogen ahead of the body, the equilibrium shock layer properties converge toward those pertaining to chemically and vibrationally-frozen flow across the bow shock . moreover, under certain conditions, the ionization level can be increased by  an order of magnitude and the usual reduction in frozen boundary layer heat transfer due to a highly-cooled noncatalytic surface can increase from stall of adjacent stages . the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed operation were also considered . this phase of the study indicated that such compromises would severely reduce the complete-compressor-stall margin . furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to abrupt-stall characteristics . the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to part-speed compressor performance . these characteristics must, however,  be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the multistage compressor . alleviation of part-speed operational problems may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage loading margin . the results of this analysis are only qualitative . the trends obtained,  however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies  of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the off-design problem . in addition to these stage-matching studies, a general discussion of variable-geometry features such as air bleed and adjustable  gas model . numerical solutions of non-equilibrium airflows with fully coupled chemistry provide a preliminary verification of such scaling for benser, w.a. .W limit characteristics . the analysis indicated that all these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance characteristics of the front stages . such discontinuities can be due to the type  of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance resulting blades is included .
