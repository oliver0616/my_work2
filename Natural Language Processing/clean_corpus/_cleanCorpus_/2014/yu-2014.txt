Multiple linear regression analysis is  conducted to determine which factors influence students  academic achievement. 84 undergraduate students in a womens  university in South Korea participated in this study. The six- predictor model was able to account for 33.5% of the variance in  final grade, F(6, 77) = 6.457, p < .001, R2 = .335. Total studying  time in LMS, interaction with peers, regularity of learning interval  in LMS, and number of downloads were determined to be  significant factors for students academic achievement in online  learning environment. These four controllable variables not only  predict learning outcomes significantly but also can be changed if  learners put more effort to improve their academic performance.  The results provide a rationale for the treatment for student time  management effort.

INTRODUCTION  Learning analytics based on educational big-data mining is an  emerging trend in the field of higher education. Whenever  students utilize the Internet, computers, or Learning Management  System (LMS), many log files are recorded.

This systematic process,  which includes data collection-analysis, achievement prediction,  and intervention treatment is called learning analytics. For  instance, Purdues Course Signals Model includes four  components, which are as follows: a) academic performance in  course, b) interaction with Learning Management System (LMS),  c) prior academic data such as high school GPA and SAT score,  and d) student characteristics such as age or residency [2].    However, three categories except b) are all about exogenous  variables which are powerful predictor variables, but are not  controllable by educators during instructions. Prior academic data  and student characteristics cannot be changed by students efforts  [1] although they are a significant factor for learning outcomes.    From the perspective of constructivism which is one of the  fundamental theories for educational technology, learning is a  self-developing process by creating or reorganizing a concept or  cognitive structure with learners experience or beliefs [3]. For  this reason, it is important to provide precautionary interventions  for individual learners to support their learning process.  Therefore, this study determines which controllable components  need to be included in learning analytics to help learners  improving their learning achievement continuously through an  educational technology approach.   2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS  Do the six suggested independent variables (IV1: Total login  frequency in LMS, IV2: Total studying time in LMS, IV3:  regularity of learning interval in LMS, IV4: Number of  downloads, IV5: Interactions with peers, and IV6: Interactions  with instructor) predict learners academic achievement   3. METHODS  3.1 Research Context  The participants in this study were 84 undergraduate students in a  face-to-face course entitled Understanding of Science of Public  Administration. This course had the following features: a) a three  credit core course for undergraduate students in the department of  Science of Public Administration, b) the instructor taught this  course during spring semester 2013 for 16 weeks, c) 20% of the  final grade was assigned for online discussion participation in  LMS, and d) students use LMS to download course materials,   269    including syllabus or assigned readings. All participants are  female students since this is a womens university.   3.2 Data Collection  Web-log data were collected from the Moodle-based Learning  Management System (LMS), and the independent variables for  this study, as shown in Table 1, were computed by automatic data  collection module embedded in the LMS. Final grades were  collected as a dependent variable in this study. Data matching  process between independent variables and final grades was  executed automatically in the database system.   Table 1. Data collecting methods for independent variables   Number Independent  variables   Data collecting   methods   IV1 Total login  frequency in LMS    Adding up the number of  individual students login  time into the LMS    IV2 Total studying  time in LMS   Calculating the total amount  of time spent between login  and logout   IV3 Regularity of  learning interval  in LMS   Calculating the standard  deviation of average login  time into the LMS   IV4 Number of  downloads   Adding up the numbers of  course materials downloaded    IV5 Interactions with  peers   Counting the total number of  students postings responding  to peers   IV6 Interactions with  instructor    Counting the total number of  students postings responding  to instructor   4. RESULTS  Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to develop a  model for predicting students academic achievement based on  their total studying time in LMS, total login frequency in LMS,  (ir)regularity of learning interval in LMS, interactions with  instructor, interactions with peers, and interactions with content.  Results are shown in Table 2.  The six-predictor model was able to account for 33.5% of the  variance in final grade, F(6, 77) = 6.457, p < .05, R2 = .335. Total  studying time in LMS and interaction with peers had a significant  (p < .05) correlation with final grade. In addition, (ir)regularity of  learning interval in LMS and number of downloads had  significant (p <. 10) partial effects in the full model. However,  total login frequency in LMS (=-.131, t=-.980, p > .05) and  interaction with instructor (=-.035, t=-.344, p > .05) did not  predict final grade.   5. CONCLUSION  The purpose of this study is to suggest more meaningful  components for learning analytics to help learners improving their  learning achievement continuously in terms of educational  technology approach. The regression model with only controllable  variables that can be affected by learners effort was able to  account for 33.5% of the variance in students academic  achievement. The main focus of learning analytics tends to focus   on the prediction of the future learning outcome by adding  geographical, demographical, or characteristic factors such as  high school GPA, SAT score, age, or residency.    Table 2. Results of multiple linear regression analysis   a. Dependent Variable: Final grade   However, these factors are not controllable because they were  fixed in the past and given to the instructional setting. Therefore,  based on the results of this study, we tested six controllable  variables for our learning analytics model and confirmed that four  of them were significantly correlated with learning final grade.  Moreover, these four variables not only predict learning outcomes  significantly but also can be changed if learners put more effort to  improve their academic performance. The advantage of learning  analytics using big-data mining is to predict students future  performance. Yet educators should pay more attention to  improving the process of learners achievement rather than  predicting achievement. However, this study was conducted with  a face-to-face course in a womens university in South Korea. In  addition, attendance rate, assignments and assessment composite,  and discussion composite were not added as independent  variables for this study because of the research context. Thus,  more research should be implemented using various course  subjects, different learning environments, and diverse participants  with different school settings, ages, sex, nationalities, and level of  student-instructor interactions.   6.
