INTRODUCTION         The Open Academic Analytics Initiative (OAAI) was a two-  year project supported by the EDUCAUSE Next Generation   Learning Challenges (NGLC) program, funded primarily by the   Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The 2 major goals involved   during the project were: (a) develop and deploy an open-source   academic early-alert system and (b) research the portability of the   predictive analytics models across all of higher education. An   initial predictive model was developed by analyzing historical   student data collected from Marist College, a four-year private   liberal arts college. The model was released under a Creative   Commons License using open source XML-based standard called   Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML). The model was   then deployed at 4 partner institutions, 2 community colleges and 2   Historical Black Colleges and Universities, as means to predict,   early in the semester, which students were at academic risk to not   complete their course successfully.  The identified were provided   with intervention strategies developed in an effort to impact student   academic performance in the course. A detailed effectiveness study   was performed to deduce the intervention strategies used and also   the portability factors of the predictive model, when the models   were deployed at institutions with significantly different academic   context (e.g. student population, course size, institution type), as   compared to Marist, where the model was originally developed.    2. EARLY ALERT SYSTEM OVERVIEW         Figure 1 depicts a brief overview of the OAAI academic alert   system. Four datasets were extracted from two major sources: (1)   Student Information System (SIS) consisting of: (a) student   demographic and aptitude data; (b) course grades and course related   data; (2) Sakai, an enterprise level open source Learning   Management System (LMS) consisting of: (c) student interaction   data generated in the course; (d) Students scores on specific  gradebook items in the grading rubric like assignments, exams etc.    Figure 1: OAAI Academic Alert System Overview          The OAAI research uses an open source business analytics   platform called Pentaho Business Intelligence suite, as its core   technology, and leverages its advanced data integration and data   mining capabilities. Predictive models were developed, verified &   validated using WEKA, Pentahos data mining module and IBM  SPSS Modeler, and tested for compatibility with other data mining   tools. Pentaho Kettle (the data integration component) was used to   transform the extractions and load it into the predictive modelling   stages of the project. Finally Pentaho Report Designer (PRD) tool   was used to generate course specific, simple, pixel perfect   Academic Alert Reports (AAR), containing the details of potential   students at academic risk as classified by the predictive models.          The paper will focus on a prototype demonstration of data   processing and predictive analysis aspects employed in the scope   of the research. The demonstration is divided into 2 categories: (1)   developing the open source academic alert model; (2) deploying the   academic alert system. The paper will conclude with a brief   overview of the future research plans.       3. BUILDING AN EARLY ALERT MODEL        This stage involves training the predictive models by analyzing  the historical data collected at Marist College. The demonstration   involves two steps, Data integration & Predictive modelling.

LAK '14, Mar 24-28 2014, Indianapolis, IN, USA   ACM 978-1-4503-2664-3/14/03.    http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567574.2567578   267  http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567574.2567578   3.1 Data Integration        The data mining processes is largely dependent on the quality  of the input data and the predictive models are only as good as its   training data [1]. The data integration process ensures data quality   enhancements that are crucial for a successful data mining process.         The Marist student data of worth 3 semesters (Fall 2010, 2011  & Spring 2011) were extracted from Sakai LMS and Banner SIS.   The 4 sources of datasets defined earlier were extracted, for each of   the semester, into a local data repository (SQL Server 2008).   Pentaho Kettle, a flow based Extraction Transformation Load   (ETL) programming tool was used to perform the data integration.    Kettle provides a rich set of data manipulation plug-ins & filters to   perform various ETL operations. The data manipulation process   can be packaged into a series of reusable jobs and transformations,   scheduled to run at various intervals, thereby streamlining the data   integration process. Kettle also supports variety of standard   input/output formats to export the final ETL outcomes.        The extraction process was followed by a data transformation   and clean-up process to enrich the data quality. The data variables   were recoded as necessary, re-scaled, transformed, and handled for   missing values and outliers. Various table join operations were   formed to create a single large integrated dataset consisting of   unique student-course record combination augmented with related   data from all the 4 source files. Variability issues arising due to   differences in Sakai tools usage and student grades assessment   criteria by the instructors across courses were handled using   statistical computing approaches [1]. The ACADEMIC_RISK   (target class variable) threshold criteria was defined in historical   Marist data by categorizing the students who secured grades C or   above as at good standing and those who secured below C grade as   at academic risk. The resulting data was later loaded into the   Predictive modelling stages to train and test the academic alert   models. Please refer [1] [2] for more details regarding the dataset   fields, recoding, transformation and derivation of predictors.     3.2 Predictive Modelling         The demonstration of predictive modelling stages include   additional data pre-processing stages before feeding the data into   the supervised machine learning algorithms to train predictive   models. The stages involved are as follows:           Partitioning Data: The consolidated datasets from the data   integration stages were partitioned to efficiently train, test and   validate the predictive models. The two partitions were: (a) training   data consisting of 2 semesters worth of data after data integration;  (b) one semester worth of data reserved for testing and validation.           Balancing Training data: The training data is usually   unbalanced in nature, as the at-risk population at Marist is very   small when compared to those in good standing. This data   imbalance, if not handled, creates a bias while training predictive   models. Hence, the minority class is balanced using oversampling   (SMOTE) & sub-sampling (Resample) filters provided by WEKA.   However, the integrity of the testing data is kept intact in this phase.          Training Predictive models & Evaluation: The balanced   training & testing datasets containing the pre-selected predictors   are fed into supervised machine learning processes like logistic   regression, support vector machines (SVM) and C4.5 decision tree   algorithms. These powerful discriminatory models learn patterns   for academic risk by analyzing the training data, and then identify   the students at risk in the testing data. The predicted outcomes from   the various trained models are compared against the actual   academic risk outcomes to determine the prediction performance of   the model. The WEKA output yields a confusion matrix which can   be used to calculate prediction potency metrics such as accuracy,   recall, false positive rates and precision. Suitable, validated, best fit   models demonstrating sufficient potency measures are saved and a   library of models are created and stored for scoring incoming   student data. These models are then exported in standard PMML or   WEKA specific formats. See [1] [2] for details regarding modelling   algorithms, evaluations and software platforms used by the OAAI.   4. EARLY ALERT SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT         The deployment stages leverage the alert models built to score   the new incoming student-course datasets that need to be classified,   in order to identify the student population which is at academic risk.   There are 3 stages involved: data integration, scoring & reporting.          The data integration stages reuse the ETL flows from the model   building stages to transform the data extracted, derive the required   predictors and prepare the scoring dataset. A suitable predictive   model is selected from the library of predictive models and is   embedded within the Kettle transformation flow using the WEKA   scoring plugin. The incoming dataset is fed to the trained predictive   model and correlations are found by analyzing the supplied   predictors to identify the students at academic risk. The model   classified outcomes contains a probability score of a student   passing and failing in a course, which can be attributed to the   models confidence in the prediction. The probabilities are used to   further categorize the students into academic risk confidence levels   (HIGH, MEDIUM & LOW).           The predictions can be exported as JSON, XML, Excel, CSV,   database table formats using Kettle for more interactive reporting.   Pentaho Report Designer (PRD) framework is used to create   reporting templates that can be embedded within the Kettle flows.   OAAI currently uses simple excel output report templates   containing the list of students who are classified as at academic risk.   The report is then shared with the faculty to devise suitable   intervention strategies. Refer [1] [2] [3] for in-depth research   findings, detailing the model results and portability factors.   5. FUTURE RESEARCH INTERESTS         The paper outlines the underlying research methodologies and    design strategies in building and deploying the early alert academic   predictive models, on an open source platform through OAAI,   using real world datasets from Marist college and its partner   institutions. The portability results have been promising and our   next focus is on large scale operationalization of the research, by   providing vendor agnostic packaging of the early alert models   ensuring easy integration with the existing LMSs in the market.     6.
