Plan Ceibal currently offers one-to-one access to technology and connectivity to every student and teacher (from primary and secondary education) as well as a comprehensive set of educational software platforms. All these resources generate massive amounts of data about the progress and style of students learning. This work introduces the conceptual framework, design and preliminary results of the Big Data Center for learning analytics currently being developed at Plan Ceibal. This initiative is focused on ex- ploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 de- grees profile will be built including information characteriz- ing the users online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies.

INTRODUCTION Plan Ceibal1 is a national policy programme that has been  implemented over the last nine years in Uruguay. At its very beginning, the government agency created for such purposes, promoted equal opportunities by providing a laptop and In- ternet access to every child and teacher. After distributing over 700.000 laptops and deploying Internet connections for schools and communities, reaching 85% of the students in the country, Plan Ceibal has made considerable progress to- wards enabling higher levels of social inclusion and equity by reducing the digital divide in all socio-economic contexts.  With a reduced digital divide, Plan Ceibal is now focused on providing the public educational system with an inte- grated set of tools, technologies, methodologies and digi- tal strategies to enhance the learning and teaching process. Plan Ceibal currently offers a set of educational software platforms for teaching, learning, training, hosting, exchang- ing and creating information. Virtual learning environments (VLE) at Plan Ceibal allow real-time interaction between students and their teachers and peers through a variety of resources and exercises, discussions or instant messag- ing. These VLEs generate massive amounts of data on the progress and style of students learning. In addition to this, after nine years of providing connectivity, Plan Ceibal has a wide range of data coming from the use of devices (tablets, laptops) and schools WiFi networks. Strategic use of data in the education sector is crucial to inform the teaching and learning process, to reduce achievement gaps and to increase the quality of public education [3].  Today Plan Ceibal is building a business intelligence sys- tem, developing preliminary experiences in educational data mining. However, until now, these databases have been col- lected and processed just for management and operational needs, without analysing multi-platform online users be- havior. In order to expand these experiences and conduct advanced analytics of the educational system, a Big Data Centre for Learning Analytics is being planned [2]. This will build the foundation for future research which can further analyze how technology is being used and how it can be used for teaching and learning practices. This involves new chal- lenges such as the development of new tools, techniques, and  1www.ceibal.edu.uy, http://www.fundacionceibal.edu.uy/en    360 User Profile Variables  Access  variables  Upload traffic Download traffic Number of connections Device type  Use variables                                Educational Taxonomy      Recreational of traffic         Social networking                               Others   Content creation Content consumption  User's  sociodemographic features  Age Gender School sociocultural context School Location  Learning Management System  Comments posted Submissions Active users Files uploaded  Ceibal's Math Adaptive Platform  Exercises completed Topic Success rate Time of usage Autonomous work  School's features  Deployment of Ceibal  intervention policies  for technology  incorporation  Learning Indicators   Engagement Performance  Figure 1: Main variables to be included in the 360  profile.  peoples skills; resolving data concerns such as how the data is captured, analyzed and disseminated protecting ethical, legal and societal concerns. In this regard, several efforts are being made by the organization in order to guarantee the quality and integrity of the data management, ensur- ing anonymity and following ethical and legal guidelines not only in accordance to the Uruguayan legislation but also in agreement with international recommendations [9].  One of the goals of this work is to build a comprehensive user online profile, hereafter referred to as 360 user pro- file. This profile, combined with statistical modelling tech- niques, can help: (i) identify online patterns on aspects such as learning styles, content creation pathways, adaptive con- tents services; (ii) predict learning behaviors; (iii) measure students engagement or retention. Also within the scope of the 360 profile, but at a larger scale, this meta-index can provide useful information of the school system as a whole. This higher level of data is expected to provide ac- curate information for decision-makers regarding how tools (e.g., devices, infrastructure) and services (e.g., connectivity, educational software) are used at a national scale. It is ex- pected that the integration of variables, aggregated or disag- gregated, can contribute to understand either general trends or individual based behavior, helping Plan Ceibal make bet- ter informed decisions on future educational strategies.  This article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the 360 user profile and proposes some of the fundamen- tal questions that motivate its creation. Sections 3 and 4 provide examples of the analysis based on the this profile. Finally, a summary of this work is presented in Section 5.  2. TOWARDS A 360 USER PROFILE The 360 user profile is the result of integrating key vari-  ables that describe a wide variety of aspects related to the online behavior of educators and learners. This profile in- cludes aspects such as: network usage (e.g., what kind of application does the learner prefer, is the learner active in social networks, is the learner active in the educational platforms), educational platforms usage (e.g., if the learner uses the educational platforms, what kind of usage does she/he do number of exercises completed, number of cor- rect exercises, number of required hints, books consulta- tions, frequency of usage, usage outside the school, proactive or teacher suggested usage, participation in discussion fo- rums, individual or collaborative work), sociocultural back- ground, school context, among others. Figure 1 presents a summary of the main variables included in the 360 user profile.  This profile will be the main input underpinning the anal- ysis in future studies, both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), ad- dressing both the need to understand the influence of tech- nology on the learning experience as well as to provide ac- curate feedback to support evidence based national policies.  When the 360 profile integrates data at a general level (school system) the information analyzed aims to provide large-scale insights to monitor and understand how and when the system is being used. What are the demands and main uses of the educational community at a national level. On the other hand, the individual-based level aims to offer a comprehensive (multi-dimensional) perspective of the user and his educational practices. Although groups of individu- als with similar behaviour can suggest patterns, the aim is to provide information that could be useful for learners and educators when monitoring the benefits and challenges of the learning experience, targeting questions such as: What student actions are associated with better performance, sat- isfaction, engagement, learning progress What features of an online learning environment lead to better performance learning When are students falling behind in the course When a student should be referred to a counselor for help  In order to illustrate how the 360 profile information is analyzed at these two levels, we provide in the following sections examples of these complementary approaches: 1) A global monitoring system which explores key trends that describe how the network is used by the school system at an aggregated level, longitudinal evolution of the traffic, among others. 2) Measuring a set of variables to understand in- dividuals performance when completing exercises with an intelligent tutoring system for mathematics (e.g., frequency, type and number of exercises completed, type of devices used, use of help, etc).  3. A GLOBAL MONITORING OF THE SCHOOLS SYSTEM  Network usage data forms a central part of the Big Data project at Plan Ceibal. To this aim, a Global Monitoring System (GMS), inspired in [6], is being developed. This GMS will enable the visualization of the network usage, which is an essential input to: (i) assess for what purposes Plan Ceibals network resources are being used, (ii) capture the dynamics of network usage to understand the existing trends and help adjust Plan Ceibals supply based on the users needs, (iii) study how the different family of devices are being used, (iv) provide network usage data at user level to build part of the key components of the 360 profile (e.g., most used resources, most visited sites and platforms, etc). The development of the GMS consists in four main phases, detailed in the Gantt diagram shown in Figure 2.  3.1 Data Sources The GMS combines access and use variables. Access vari-  ables include upload and download traffic (per site, user, or application), number of connections (per site, user, or ser- vice), and multiple types of devices (laptops, tablets, smart- phones, others). Use variables cover the taxonomy of traffic (pedagogical or educational, recreational or entertainment, among others), origin and destination of traffic (school, home, national, or international), and content production versus consumption. The access variables show which online appli-    2015 2016 2017  Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2  100% completeConceptual framework  100% completeDesign  75% completeImplementation  0% completeEvaluation  Figure 2: Planning for the Global Monitoring Sys- tem project.  40M  30M  20M  10M  0M 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  A ve  ra g e  D  o w  n lo  a d  p  e r   S it e  [ b p s ]  YEAR  2  2  2  2  2  100M  80M  60M  40M  20M  0M T1 T2 T3 T4  A ve  ra g e  D  o w  n lo  a d  p  e r   S it e  [ b p s ]  YEAR  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  YEAR  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  Figure 3: Traffic demand evolution of Plan Ceibal network from February 2011 to December 2015, ac- cumulated by quarters (left) and by month (right).  cations and devices are consuming more network resources (i.e., bandwidth, wifi connections), while the use variables il- lustrate the types of use (e.g., educational, recreational, type of devices, etc) therefore suggesting the means and motiva- tions for getting online.  3.2 Preliminary results  3.2.1 Traffic and connections The conceptual framework for the definition of global ac-  cess variables was presented in [7] and an initial analysis of results is introduced in [12]. The latter focuses on the question: what was the evolution of the aggregate demand of Internet access in the Plan Ceibal network between 2011 and 2015 and what is the projection for 2016 to 2019  The considered variables are download and upload inter- net traffic and simultaneous connections. These variables were collected hourly everyday, from February 2011 until December 2015. The analysis was conducted with the value of these variables at busy hour2. The number of potential users in the network was 625.000, of whom about 120.000 were simultaneously connected during busy hour [4].  Figure 3 presents two charts: the first one, aggregated in quarters, shows a consistent increase in traffic demand from quarter to quarter. In the second chart, the aggrega- tion is done by month, showing a dramatic decrease during the summer break (December to February), and a moder- ate decrease during the winter break (July). Figure 4 shows the evolution of traffic per site and simultaneous connec- tions during the period 2011 to 2015, considering primary and secondary schools. It is interesting to note that, start- ing in 2014, the number of connections in secondary schools has grown dramatically, surpassing those in primary schools. This phenomenon correlates in time with the introduction of the Bring Your Own Device Policy in secondary schools (users are now allowed to connect to Plan Ceibals network their personal devices), which may explain the effect.  260 minute period of the day during which the maximum total traffic load of the network occurs.  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016  Year  0M  10M  20M  30M  40M  50M  D o w  n lo  a d s  p  e r  S  it e  [ b p s ]  Primary Schools  Secondary Schools  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016  Year  0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  900  A v e ra  g e  C  o n n e c ti o n s  p  e r  S  it e  g  Primary Schools  Secondary Schools  Figure 4: Traffic demand (left) and number of conexions (right) evolution of Plan Ceibal network from February 2011 to December 2015 for primary and secondary schools.  From these preliminary results we observe that Plan Ceibals internet download traffic has grown 13 times between 2011 and 2015. CISCO VNI reported that global Internet down- load traffic has grown five times in the same period [6]. In other words, Plan Ceibals internet consumption has grown about 2.5 times faster than the global Internet. At the same time, download traffic has doubled every 18 months during the period between 2011 and 2015, while upload traffic also doubled every 16 months in the same period. Simultaneous connections per site have doubled every 12 months between 2011 and 2015. Based on these observations, and consider- ing that aspects such as the bandwith capacity, the number of devices and the number of active users are expected to increase, the hypothesis is that the network will continue expanding.  4. TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING ASSESSMENT  The 360 user profile will include variables describing socio- cultural aspects (e.g., school socio-cultural level), school char- acteristics (e.g., full-time, part-time, special education, geo- graphical area, internet connectivity), information concern- ing the use of educational platforms (e.g., number of users, activities on the platform, type and intensity of use), among others. Furthermore, meta-indexes will be built, from the analysis and combination of these variables, to study more general concepts such as students school engagement and performance.  Student performance is a major point of interest and has therefore been studied from several perspectives. One such approach is to model student learning curves using cogni- tive models such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing [8], Per- formance Factor Analysis [15], Additive Factor Models [5], among others, studying individual or collaborative work [13]. Another perspective is to follow a more classical data min- ing approach using classical classification or regression tech- niques to predict grade scores from various features, such as previous scores, students demographics, extra-curricular ac- tivities, high school background, social interaction network, psychometric factors, among others [17]. Furthermore, there exists an extensive bibliography on relationship mining fo- cused on finding relationships between performance and var- ious features, such as the ones previously listed for perfor- mance prediction [10, 11, 18, 16, 1].  As an integral part of the creation of the 360 user pro- file, we will study performance from different perspectives, as well as the effects of technology enhanced learning on performance outcomes. In the following section we present a particular case study of performance which focuses on stu-    Table 1: Adaptive platform for mathematics (PAM) users and number of performed activities from June 2013 to September 2016.

This ITS im- plements an adaptive platform for mathematics (PAM, for its acronym in Spanish), which proposes series of exercises and suggests particular areas of improvement depending on the users mathematical skills. Table 1 presents a summary of global usage indicators of this platform. So far this year, 27 million exercises have been made in the platform, 63% of which were performed by primary school students, 25% by secondary school students and the rest being completed by other beneficiaries of Plan Ceibal. It is important to remark that a very heterogeneous use of the platform is observed, as 20% of the total users completed 75% of the total exercises.  By combining data from different sources, including log- files of the users activity in PAM, we aim at studying the effect of various factors on students performance and an- swering fundamental questions such as: the more exercises the better What role does frequency of exercises com- pleted play here Do proactive and autonomous students outperform the rest Do schools receiving supportive Plan Ceibal policies have an increased average performance than the rest To what extent the engagement of the teacher with the platform affects the performance of the student and if so under what circumstances Is higher performance in the platform related to particular patterns of network usage  4.1.1 Data Sources The considered dataset consists of 120.000 students in  1760 schools. The variables to be studied can be classi- fied into five main categories: socio-cultural (e.g., schools socioeconomic context), geographical (e.g., urban or rural school), educational (e.g., the deployment of Ceibal inter- vention policies, such as the presence of support teachers to promote technology incorporation at school), technology (e.g., type of device used by the user) and user-specific (e.g., whether the user has a proactive attitude towards using PAM or not). Table 2 shows a detailed description of some of the considered variables. The performance indicator is here defined as the total number of correct exercises com- pleted by the student in PAM in a given time period, for instance half or a complete school year.  3Data from June to December. 4Data from January to September. 5Growth corresponding to September 2015 to September 2016.  4.1.2 Methodology In order to gain further insight into the effect of certain  factors into students performance in PAM, we will evalu- ate possible correspondences between the variables listed in Table 2 and performance. First, the Pearson correlation between each variable and the performance outcomes will be computed to find possible linear dependences between these variables. Second, following a classical data mining approach, we will conduct various regression methods for performance prediction from the considered variables. More precisely, we will assess the prediction capacity of common classification methods such as decision trees, Naive Bayes, SVM and random forests, previously shown to be power- ful for educational data mining applications [14, 19]. This evaluation will show the capacity of this set of variables to predict the performance outcomes.  5. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK This work provides an overview of a unique national-scale  education and technology monitoring system developed in Uruguay. Different efforts are currently conducted to adopt new metrics to better understand and support users needs in Uruguays educational system.  The overall goal of the Big Data Centre for Learning An- alytics at Plan Ceibal is to build a 360 degrees user profile at a school or at users level (the later can include students or educators). Approaching these two levels is considered useful to fulfil the information needs of different communi- ties (e.g., educators, learners, school leaders, policy makers, technology developers, researchers, etc.)  Today, the demand of Plan Ceibals resources is facing a phase of expansion. This is considered a significant op- portunity to improve the analysis process in order to better answer the needs of the different stockholders linked with this education and technology national initiative.  Acknowledging that building a multi-dimensional profile demands the selection and integration of key indicators, in this article the authors provide a framework of variables and information sources to consider when building these two stages of the 360 profile.  Noteworthy, the principal goal is to elaborate a meta- index, which provides relevant and accurate data of the teaching and/or learning experiences. In other words, if this analysis does not offer tools either to support the work of educators while they plan their teaching, or to provide rele- vant data for the learners regarding their performance (i.e., to support self-directed autonomous learning), then the pro- posed implementation will be suboptimal at best.  As follow, some of the forthcoming challenges that we an- ticipate during the creation of the meta-index (360 degrees profile) are highlighted:  1. Although Plan Ceibal manages national scale educa- tional information, it is considered strategic to begin with the analysis at two levels (schools and users). The idea is to design mechanisms to compare large scale and individual- based analysis, whose outcomes will be relevant for different stakeholders.  2. The broader the scope of data available to include in the process the higher the responsibility of adopting proper standards to ensure the quality and integrity of the data management, protecting the identity and privacy of users (i.e., privacy-by-design) or following appropriate ethical and    Table 2: Variables used for performance prediction.
