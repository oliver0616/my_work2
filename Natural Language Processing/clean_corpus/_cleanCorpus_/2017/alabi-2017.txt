      Best Intentions: Learner Feedback on   Learning Analytics Visualization Design   Halimat Alabi, Marek Hatala  Simon Fraser University   250-13450 102nd Avenue  Surrey, BC V3T 0A3   {halabi, mhatala}@sfu.ca    ABSTRACT  A mixed methods approach was undertaken in this exploratory  study to better understand how learners perceive and utilize  learning analytics visualizations during online discussions  activities. Internal conditions such as goal orientation and  numeracy were measured alongside the external conditions  created by the discussion structure and learning analytics. Our  results emphasize key factors that should be considered when  designing learning analytics tools.

INTRODUCTION  A primary functions of learning analytics (LA) is to aid in the  development, monitoring, and regulation of learning strategies. As  a self-regulated learning (SLR) feedback provisioning tool, LA  contribute to the conditions that influence learners interpretations  of their academic standings in relationship to their own goals  and/or the performance of their peers. To employ appropriate  regulatory strategies learners must draw the correct conclusions  from the information visualized, yet how this happens is poorly  understood. It is of the utmost importance then for educational  technology designers to ensure that the pedagogically founded  intentions exemplified by the LA visualizations produce the  desired effects.    2. BACKGROUND  The types of assumptions that people make with graphs are  influenced by several factors including graphicacy or graph  literacy, numeracy, subject matter expertise, and individual  difference. It is known that visualizations carry framing effects;  low numerate individuals are more apt to be misled by framing  and format effects [6]. Individuals with low graphicacy tend to  ignore the relationships depicted within [5]. Conversely, high  numeracy and cognitive reflexivity  the tendency for in depth   rational thought  are both correlated with successful performance  on probabilistic prediction tasks [9]. Particularly within the  context of learning, internal motivational and metacognitive states  are pivotal. These internal conditions move learners to delve  deeper, to reflect, act upon, and trust the feedback provided by  LA. Together LA visualizations act in concert with these internal  conditions, forming the visual foundation of learners judgments  of learning (JOL). Though there exists no established set of best  practices for graphically displaying risky information [7], may be  tailored to be contextually relevant for non-expert users skill and  experience level with visualizations. Educational technology  designers must recognize these contextual factors in order to  mitigate the application of incorrect learning strategies that may  ultimately risk learners academic success.    3. METHODOLOGY   Designed to visually emphasize either post quality or performance  in comparison to high performing peers, two types of LA  visualizations were deployed in online small group discussion  activities. We hypothesized that (1) learners with mastery  achievement goals would view both types of visualizations more  frequently, that (2) learners with a performance orientation would  utilize the top contributor visualization more often, and that (3)  highly numerate learners would demonstrate a preference for  numerical, less abstract visualizations. Quantitative performance  information  including posts, replies, discussion thread and  visualization views  was collected directly from the learning  management system. Questionnaires on numeracy and goal  orientation were distributed to determine if individual differences  in these areas would impact learners behaviours. In one-on-one  interviews learners provided feedback on (1) their actual use of  the visualizations in the discussion activities, (2) the perceived  utility of new visualizations in simulated discussions, and (3)  perceived utility after interaction with new LA visualization  prototypes.    3.1 Participants   Study participants were volunteers from online and blended  learning undergraduate courses offered by Simon Fraser  University. Across 8 discussion activities 178 learners had the  opportunity to utilize one of the two randomly assigned  visualizations, with remaining learners in each course serving as  the control group. Twelve learners volunteered for additional  follow-up interviews.   3.2 Procedure   In courses 1 and 2 one third of participants saw the visualizations.  A crossover design was used in courses 3 and 4; one quarter of  participating learners in each of two discussions was assigned  either the top contributor or quality visualizations. Learners were  not required to complete all of the questionnaires to participate in  the study, resulting in disparate numbers between each section.

A short self-assessment of numerical preference  and aptitude, the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS) is strongly  correlated with objective tests of numeracy [3, 6] such as the  Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT) [1], also used in this study. The  Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) examines cognitive impulsivity  [4, 8]. Taken together they represent the internal conditions, the  academic orientation that learners bring to the activity.    The 2 course visualizations and the proposed prototypes all  supported both self and socially shared learning regulation. The  four proposed visualizations  a polar graph, avatar, bar-graph- based cityscape, and ecosystem  ranged in aesthetic complexity.  Two versions of each visualization were constructed to allow  individual and group performance comparisons.      4. FINDINGS  We sought to examine how learners use the formative feedback  from LA visualizations to monitor, make learning judgments, and  metacognitively reflect upon their self-regulatory learning  strategies. Of the factors hypothesized to attribute to differences in  learners performance with LA  including goal orientation, self- reported or objective numeracy  none were substantiated in the  quantitative data from all of the classes combined. Results on the  SNS and CRT were low; 75% of learners were at or below the  median SNS score, 67% at or below the median CRT score.  Similarly, 50% of the interviewees scored in the lowest quartile of  the BNT, and 75% in the lowest tertile of the CRT. Indications of  superficial cognition were evident in the number of learners who  did not read the instructions for how to access or interpret the  visualizations. This behavior was so common that LA designers  must plan for it; options include the employment of pop up  messages or locking the visualizations until the explanatory text is  reviewed. The high number of interviewees who made incorrect  assumptions about the information depicted might also indicate  low graphicacy. Though it has been theorized that 80% of the  population are graphically literate, these results are in line with an  international review of adult graphicacy that places Canadian  graphicacy at 50%.1   Interview questions focused on JOL made with the LA,  particularly if, when, and how these judgements resulted in  behavioural changes. The LA were utilized most often by  interviewees motivated by competition. Though both  visualizations support social regulation of learning, the top  contributor visualization resulted in more messages being posted  than the quality visualization. Results were mixed when  interviewees were asked if they would use the visualizations to  decide whom to interact with. Use of the LA as a memory aid was  even less common, though one interviewee requested LA  visualizations indicating change over time to track her progress.   Our initial coding scheme had to be adjusted to reflect affect,  which was mentioned by all participants as being influential to  their behaviors. Specifically stated was the need for elucidations  of trust within both the visualizations and their underlying                                                                        1 Programme for the International Assessment of Adult   Competencies (PIAAC) found at http://www23.statcan.gc.ca- /imdb/p2SV.plFunction=getSurvey&SDDS=4406     algorithms. This presents a challenge since 7 of the 12  interviewees had difficulty understanding the visualizations, and 8  of the 12 misunderstood some aspect of the collected data. This  was due at least in part to not reading the instructions or tooltips.  Some participants viewed the LA, but gave them little credence  when they differed from what was expected. Instead, these  learners preferred to persist in their own biased opinions of their  performance, potentially exhibiting the effects of anchoring bias.    The sizeable impact of affect on JOL and subsequent behaviour  was echoed later in the interviews, when participants rated the  visualization prototypes. The majority of participants, 11 of 12,  chose the visualizations that were either visually stimulating or  made them feel good. Tellingly, the person who rated the  visualization with the least affective impact the highest said, I  dont really like anything that has an emotional connection,  because I dont want to be judging how I feel about myself based  on what an algorithm is saying my [discussion activity] posts  are.   5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS   Even when based in pedagogy, sometimes the best designerly  intentions are misconstrued. To support learners accurate JOL,  we must better understand the internal and external conditions that  contribute to the learning environment. To this end this study is  currently being conducted with online learners, recognizing that  online learners may be more reliant on LA than blended learners  to navigate course discussions.   6.
