INTRODUCTION  Customized content of e-textbook require teachers to spend  greater efforts using authoring tools and planning activities before  class, and teachers with various contexts have different demands  on e-textbook [3]. However, some teachers have insufficient ICT  skills or the e-textbooks mismatch teachers ICT demands, then  the rejection of e-textbook happens [2]. Thus we need to know the  status of teachers usage earlier before we decide to give them  some technical supports. We investigate this issue within the  context of data from an e-textbook platform named ZoomClass  which includes a web-based authoring environment and an iPad  application for teachers. Teachers were given access to customize  all e-textbook content for specific teaching objectives, they  typically create courses, upload media resources, design tasks,  assign activities, and insert quizzes on the web-based environment  before class, they also can record and upload photos and videos by  iPad application. The users of ZoomClass are teachers and  students at a primary school of Shanghai. We obtained data on  teacher authoring action records and e-textbook activity records,  for 83 teachers enrolled in this e-textbook platform, observed over  4 terms form 2014 October to 2016 June. The teachers performed   a total of 158,087 actions, created 2,745 courses, and organized  1,601 activities in class. We labeled teachers with low quantity   10 of e-textbook activities for classroom instruction as   inactive users. As a result, there are 40 inactive teachers and 43  active teachers that adopted ZoomClass.   2.! METHODOLOGY  The features creation of this studys predictive model are based on  event segmentation, which means dividing a given number of  teachers action observation into subsets with statistical  characteristics that are similar within each subsets and different  between subsets [1]. Segmentation has been widely employed to  study earth science such as a change point detection [1], and  financial science such as subsequence matching [4]. Zheng and  colleagues [5] developed an analysis method to discover the user  water behavioral habits, in their invention, a novel continuous  event segmentation algorithm was created to automatically  separate the water usage records into multiple individual bath  events, this study employed a same method to create features from  teachers early action record data sets for predictive model.   2.1! Event segmentation  The goal of event segmentation is to automatically organize  teacher actions into separate events, the segmentation method is  only based the date time information of action log records. We  consider action records in chronological order such that   $ = $&,  , $)                                         (1)  where $*  is the +th action record in data set $ with length ,. A  event segment -*,. which is a subset of $ can be given as   -*,. = $*,  , $. ,///1  +  0  ,                           (2)  The time differences between inter-action records in an event are  typically smaller than time differences between inter-action  records from separate events. In the event segmentation algorithm  created by Zheng et al. [5], a threshold of time difference has been  used to determine whether consecutive action records are in a  same event. The algorithm consists of following steps: 1.  Compute inter-action intervals; 2. Compare every interval to the  threshold of time difference. In step 2, If the interval is smaller,  these two inter-actions are considered in a same event, if the  interval is greater, they are divided into two different events. The  algorithm will run through all of inter-action intervals, then we  can obtain individual events from action log sets.   2.2! Threshold Optimization  In step 2 above, an automatic optimization has been used to  achieve individual threshold of inter-event interval for each  teacher, because the various ICT and instruction contexts of  teachers need be considered. The threshold optimization of each   Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Segment events with  successively varying thresholds of time difference; 2. Compute  event numbers for each threshold; 3. Specify minimum rate of  event numbers change for optimal threshold detection.          Figure 1 shows an example of a teachers segmentations with  varying thresholds. Here, the number of events has a big drop  when threshold is smaller than 11 minutes, it means that the most  inter-action intervals of the teacher are smaller than 11minutes. It  is highly likely to separate an individual event into two or more  sub-events if a small value is determined as threshold. Therefore,  an interval value is more rational to determined as threshold until  the number of individual events touches down and remains almost  unchanged. The slopes of inter-thresholds are used to detect the  signal of change rate. When the average of/1/(In this study, 1 is  set to 8) consecutive slopes of inter-threshold are closet to zero,  the first threshold point in slope window is flagged as optimal  threshold value of an individual teachers inter-event interval. In  Figure 1, the point of 26 minute is possible the optimal threshold.   2.3! Creation of Model Features  The goal of this study is making prediction at a stage where  teachers just started to use ZoomClass, so we focused on the usage  from the first one week to two weeks. Three features were  distilled from teacher usage events segmentation based on early  action records, including average interval of inter-action records  within events, average duration of events, and the number of  continuous using events (The event that contains more than one  isolated action is considered as continuous using event in this  study).   3.! RESULTS  The original, non-standardized features from the first weeks data  are shown in Table 1, including how their values compare  between those who were labeled to have adopted ZoomClass and  those who have not. Conducting an independent samples t-test  indicates that the differences of means of features between two  groups are statistically significant.   We applied two classification algorithms, Logistic Regression and  CART (Classification And Regression Tree), to these three  features, and evaluated the models using Kappa, precision, recall,  and area under the ROC curve (Table 2). We also applied event  segmentation algorithm and predictive model to the datasets by  first 10 days and 14 days. In these analyses, we conducted  stratified fold cross-validation as a check on over-fitting. These  predictive models are acceptable across all metrics. Arguably, the  models based on more observations perform better according to   Kappa and AUC, and CART applied on the dataset by first 10  days achieves the best Recall among the models.    Table 1.

CONCLUSION  This paper introduced an approach for event segmentation based  on teachers action records within e-textbooks, and the features  distillation from individual event characterize the usage for each  teacher. It is indeed possible to use predictive models to identify  the teachers who would not adopt new technology in early days  with reasonable predictive performance. Future work involves the  discoveries of more characteristics and unknown behaviors within  the e-textbook usage events of teacher, not only the date time  information, but the interaction category and teaching context will  be considered in event segmentation and prediction.   5.!
