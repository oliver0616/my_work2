As the main form of instruction, students   engagement behaviour with MOOC videos directly impacts the   students success or failure. This research focuses on an in-depth   analysis of 1.5 million video interactions (e.g. pause, seek video)   of a Programming MOOC. Our video-by-video analysis   explores the rationale behind the time-wise variation of video   interactions. We aim to analyse discourse features (e.g. syntactic   simplicity of text, and speaking rate) and their correlation with   the video interaction patterns. This paper presents preliminary   results and educational video design implications.

INTRODUCTION  Despite the significant usage of assessments, discussion forums   and collaborative activities, lecture videos remain the most   widely used instructional methods throughout the course span of   many Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) [1]. Therefore,   students engagement with lecture videos is likely to associate   with students success or failure in the MOOCs. However,   limited research studies have focused on in-depth video   analytics apart from exploring the video watching behaviour [2-  4]. Li et al. [2] found that replays and frequent pauses   significantly correlate with the perceived video difficulty (e.g.   easy, neutral, difficult). Kim et al. [3] explored the aspects of   video interaction patterns and in-video drop-outs and found that   61% of video drop-outs are associated with the visual transition   (e.g. changing from whiteboard explanation to a talking head).   Our work is building on the existing research by Kim et al. [3] to   explore the association between video interactions and non-  visual (i.e. verbal) transition. Another preliminary study by Kim   et al. [4] found that video interaction peaks occur during topic   transition. We extend this approach to conduct an in-depth   video-by-video analysis to measure the effect of discourse   features for the variation of video interactions events (e.g. pause,   seek video).  Our analysis explores whether the underlying   pedagogical and discourse processing theories are considered   when creating MOOC videos.    2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 Data  We analyse the AdelaideX Programming MOOC (code101x)   offered during 2015. During the initial offering, 26,129   participants were registered (active  13,930, received verified   certificate  831). The course covers introductory programming   concepts and creating artwork, animations with ProcessingJS.   The course lasts for 6 weeks with an average of 8 videos per   week. The average length of a video is 3.63 minutes. The course   was taught by 3 lecturers, each sharing approximately one-third   of the syllabus. The 3 lecturers share similar presentation style   (e.g. talking head, programming screens). We extracted de-  identifiable 1.5 million records of video interaction events (e.g.   play/pause, seek video)1. Our text corpus for discourse analysis   contains 51 video transcript files (SubRip Text) with a total of   1631 sentences and associated time.    2.2 Method  Our study aims to answer the following research question;   Do the discourse features correlate with interaction patterns of   MOOC videos If so, what specific features are they   2.2.1 Video data processing  The cleaning of the dataset mainly focuses on removing records   without a video id. We eliminate first and last few seconds (5-10   seconds) of each video due to auto-load/stop. We extracted the   amount of video interactions per second in each video. From   this, we eliminate the records when students do not return to the   video after a reasonable timeframe, assuming that the particular   pause is not related to curiosity or confusion. Likewise, we   analyse seek event (e.g. skip interval), speed change, show   closed captions/transcripts which could potentially associate   with the issues of discourse processing. We exclude load and   stop events from our analysis.   2.2.2 Discourse analysis  Discourse analysis involves extracting sentences from   transcripts to measure discourse and linguistic features. We   utilise Coh-Metrix 3.0 [5] to identify features (see Table 1).   However, we re-implement many of the features since the tool   does not provide an API for sentence-by-sentence analysis and   the manual use of web tool2 is a time-consuming task.                                                                       1 http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/devdata/en/latest/internal_data_formats/tracking_logs.html   2 http://tool.cohmetrix.com/   Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for   personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies   bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

RESULTS  Figure 1 shows all video interactions (n = 73,257) of a sample   video. A manual inspection suggests that non-visual transitions   are motives for some interaction peaks. For instance, introducing   the new concept function causes for the highlighted peak   (Figure 1). Note: Analysis of individual events (e.g. pause) is   not presented in this paper due to space limitations.      Fig. 1: Video interaction-time of a sample video   We measure the correlation between discourse features and   video interactions using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r).    Table 1. Correlation between discourse features and video   interactions   Feature Sub-feature (correlation)   Descriptive Word count (0.558*), Syllable count (0.556*)   Text Easability   PC   Narrativity (-0.347), syntactic simplicity (-0.247), word   concreteness (-0.156), referential cohesion (-0.103),   deep cohesion (-0.005), connectivity (-0.514*)   Lexical  diversity   Type-token ratio (-0.47*), MLTD (0.487*)   Connectives Causal (-0.56*), logical (0.022), contrastive (0.03),    Word  information   Pronoun (-0.115) , content word frequency (-0.317*),  familiarity (0.193) , concreteness (0.186),    Speaking rate Time per sentence (0.562*)   *p<0.001   According to the Table 1, descriptive features (e.g. word count)   demonstrate a strong positive correlation with video interactions   (Figure 2). This denotes that the longer the sentence, it is likely   that the students highly interact with the video (e.g. pause)   which is an indicator for confusion or curiosity [3]. Text   Easability features (e.g. narrativity) are mostly supportive for   discourse processing [5], demonstrating a negative correlation   with the video interactions. However, these correlations are not   significant except connectivity. We obtained a contradictory   result for lexical diversity. Lexical diversity measures the ratio   between unique words and the total number of tokens in a   sentence. Lexically diverse texts are difficult to process, and   hence expected to correlate positively with video interactions.   However, type-token ratio demonstrates a strong negative   correlation. A manual inspection of a random sample of the   corpus suggests that lexical diversity negatively correlates with   the sentence length. To overcome this, an estimation algorithm   is proposed to measure lexical diversity (i.e. MLTD) [5], which   provides our expected outcome. An interesting finding is   observed on causal connectives. Sentences with causal   connectives (e.g. because, so) demonstrate a strong negative   correlation (r= -0.56) with video interactions. Causal   relationships present a consequence, allowing learners to   understand the reason-why relation. Our results claim that   inclusion of causal connectives in the video discourse will   improve the students discourse processing. In contrast, other   connectives such as logical (e.g. and, or), contrastive (e.g.   however) do not correlate with video interactions. However,   these claims are not conclusive as the study presented here is   preliminary. We also analyse the impact of pronouns (e.g. I,   you, them) in text for the video engagement and obtained no   correlation. However, frequent content words supported for   discourse processing (r= -0.316). Moreover, spoken discourse   features like speaking rate positively correlated with video   interactions, demonstrating that the lecturers time spent on each   sentence will impact on students engagement with the video.

IMPLICATIONS  This preliminary work establishes a step towards the   consideration of discourse to construct educational videos for   MOOCs. Our results highlight the importance of avoiding   lengthy sentences, reducing lexical diversity and speaking rate,   increasing the use of causal connectives, and frequent use of   content words. MOOC educators/video designers could consider   the data-driven implications of this research to improve video   engagement. In future, we intend to expand this research using   larger text corpora and few more MOOCs to measure the effect   of features like cohesion, semantic analysis, and situation model.    5.
