VASCORLL is a system for   visualizing and analyzing the learning logs collected by the   seamless learning system, which supports language learning in the   real-world. As far, several studies have been made in the seamless   learning environments in order to bridge formal learning over   informal learning. However, their focus was the implementation   of the seamless learning environment in education. This study   focuses on visualizing and analyzing learning logs collected in the   seamless learning environment. This paper describes how our   analytics could contribute to bridging the gap between formal and   informal learning. An experiment was conducted to evaluate 1)   whether our developed VASCORLL is effective in connecting the   words learned in formal learning to the ones learned in informal   learning, 2) which social network algorithm is effective to   enhance learning in the seamless learning environment. Twenty   international students participated in the evaluation experiment,   and they were able to increase their learning opportunities by   using VASCORLL. In addition, it was found that the   betweenness centrality is useful in finding central words bridging   formal and informal learning. 1   CCS CONCEPTS    Human-centered computing   Ubiquitous and mobile   computing  Ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and   tools    KEYWORDS   Ubiquitous learning, seamless learning, learning analytics   1 INTRODUCTION   Seamless learning is defined as an approach when a person   experiences a continuity of learning, and consciously bridges the   multifaceted learning efforts, across a combination of locations,   times, technologies or social settings [28].  Several researchers in                                                                     Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or   classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed   for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full   citation on the first page.

ISBN 978-1-4503-4870-6/17/03$15.00   DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3027385.3027408   the seamless learning field have pointed out that mobile and   ubiquitous technologies have enabled students to learn   continuously across different contexts [10], [11]. The main   characteristics of seamless learning are shown as follows: (1)   Encompassing formal and informal learning, (2) Encompassing   personalized and social learning, (3) Across time, (4) Across   locations, (5) Ubiquitous knowledge access, (6) Encompassing   physical and digital worlds, (7) Combined use of multiple device   types, (8) Seamless switching between multiple learning tasks, (9)   Knowledge synthesis, (10) Encompassing multiple pedagogical or   learning activity models.   One of its most important issues is how to connect formal learning   with informal one, because this is inevitable in designing both in-  school and out-of-school activities in order to link what they have   learned in school with their daily life experiences and vice versa,   that is to say, to connect what they have learned in their daily lives   to their experiences in class. In this paper, the term formal   learning is defined as the learning under intentionally organized   environments and the term informal learning is defined as the   learning out of organized environments. For example, inside-of-  class learning is one of the formal learning situations and out-of-  class self-learning is one of the informal learning situations.   One of the application domains of seamless learning is language   learning. For example, Wong et al. [27] reported a seamless   learning system called MyCLOUD (My Chinese UbiquitOUs   learning Days), which allows students to learn Chinese language   in both in-school and out-of-school learning spaces. Uosaki et al.   [25] reported a seamless learning system called SMALL System   (Seamless Mobile-Assisted Language Learning support system) in   order to support Japanese students who aim to learn English   language in a formal and an informal setting.   Most of these studies focused on realizing a seamless learning   environment at school or university. Once realized, the students   learning logs have been accumulated into their server. Therefore,   we contend that learning efficacy can be enhanced by visualizing   and analyzing their accumulated learning logs. So far, little   attention has been paid to this aspect. The research issues of   learning analytics based on seamless learning environments are as   follows:   (1) How to visualize and analyze learning logs accumulated in   formal and informal learning systems.    (2) How the analytics can bridge the gap between formal learning   and informal learning.   (3) How the analytics can enhance and support students learning   experiences.                  To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a visualization and   analysis system called VASCORLL (Visualization and Analysis   System for Connecting Relationships of Learning Logs).   VASCORLL is to connect logs collected by using e-book system   with logs collected by using a ubiquitous learning system called   SCROLL (System for Capturing and Reminding of Learning Log)   [21]. The rest of this paper is constructed as follows. Section 2   discusses related works regarding e-book-based learning analytics   and ubiquitous learning analytics. Section 3 introduces our   proposed seamless learning design and the system that   implements with SCROLL. Section 4 describes the methods of   VASCORLL that works in the seamless learning environments.   Section 5 and 6 describes the implementation and initial   evaluation experiment on the VASCORLL. Section 7 summarizes   the contributions made by the work and future works.   2 RELATED WORKS   2.1 E-book-based Learning Analytics   Nowadays, majority of textbooks are not only published in printed   format, but are also created as electronic text-book (e-book)   format available online or on mobile devices [2], [24]. Japanese   govemment has announced their future policy to introduce   instead of as their policy that they plan to introduce e-books in   all K12 schools by 2020. Many countries e-book policies only   focus on introducing the technology of e-books into K12 schools   [22]. However, little attention has been paid to visualizing and   analyzing important information from the e-book activity logs.   Therefore, it is necessary to explore various analytics in this   aspect.   This paper calls visualizing and analyzing of e-book activity logs   E-book-based Learning Analytics (ELA). In such analytics,   some researchers at Kyushu University in Japan reported several   analytics using a document viewer system called BookLooper   [22], [23], [29]. The objective of their studies is as follows: (1)   improving of learning materials, (2) analyzing learning patterns,   (3) detecting the students comprehensive level, (4) predicting   final grades, and (5) recommending e-books in accordance with   personalization. On the other hand, Kiyota et al. [8] proposed a   seamless learning system with EPUB (Electronic PUBlication:   one of the e-book formats). It is available on various mobile   devices including general smartphones, and it is easy to obtain   information, such as location, acceleration and rotation of the   terminal via their integrated sensors while students read the books.   The most common idea of those projects is to visualize and   analyze either logs collected in a formal setting or an informal   setting, especially, logs collected in a formal setting. However,   VASCORLL aims to visualize and analyze learning logs   accumulated in both learning environments (formal and informal   setting).   2.2 Ubiquitous Learning Analytics   In recent years, ubiquitous learning (u-learning) or mobile   learning (m-learning) has been the focus of attention in   educational research across the world [14], [19]. U-learning has   been carried out using ubiquitous technologies such as RFID tags   and cards, wireless communications, mobile phones, Personal   Digital Assistants (PDAs), and wearable computers [20]. These   types of learning include not only in-class learning (formal   learning), but also a variety of out-of-class learning (informal   learning) in spaces such as homes, libraries, and museums. In   such learning approaches, the majority of researchers have been   constructing a context-aware u-learning system, which integrated   learning materials and contextual information by using ubiquitous   technologies. For example, Hwang et al. [6] developed a context-  aware ubiquitous learning system with the attached RFID tag on   the plants. The application domain of their studies is nature   science. When a learner arrives in front of a plant with an RFID   tag, the system asks him or her questions about the plants   features, such as its trunk, shape, and color after they received it   using an RFID reader. This enables learners to understand deeply   by connecting knowledge about the plant with the real life   experience.   On the other hand, Ogata et al. [21] developed their u-learning   system called SCROLL, which allows users to share with others   by recording what learners have learned in their daily lives using a   web browser and mobile device anytime and anywhere. The   application domain of their studies is mainly language learning.   Using SCROLL, international students can learn new knowledge   through their experiences in their daily life with photos, audios,   and context such as location and place.   Aljohani et al. [17] described learning analytics called Ubiquitous   Learning Analytics (ULA) in order to analyze enormous learning   data, including contextual information accumulated by using these   u-learning systems. The value of the ULA is discussed by   considering two possible kinds of interactions. The first is the   interaction between learners and their contexts, referred to as   learners-to-context interaction. The second is the interaction   between learners and context-based knowledge, referred to as   learner-to-context-based learning materials interaction. They   suggested that the use of learner contextual data can enhance the   interaction between learners and their mobile devices, and   between learners and objects in their learning environments. In   addition, analyzing or visualizing contextual data has a potential   to improve knowledge of the patterns of learners interactions   with their contexts. One of the issues of the ULA is how to   visualize and analyze two interactions: learners-to-context and   learner-to-context-based words.   Mouri et al. [12], [13] tackled the issues and reported innovative   visualization and analysis methods. However, the focus of their   studies was to visualize and analyze learning logs accumulated in   ubiquitous learning environments (informal setting). Our   VASCORLL enables students to bridge the gap between formal   and informal learning by visualizing and analyzing what they   have learned in the classroom using a document viewer system   and what they have learned outside the classroom using SCROLL.   By providing the results of visualization and analysis, it is   expected that students can apply what they have learned in the   classroom to what they have learned outside the classroom.   3 SYSTEM DESIGN   3.1 Scroll   As described in Section 2.2, this paper utilizes SCROLL to   support international students in the real-world language learning   and share their experiences with each other. In the SCROLL      3   project, Ubiquitous Learning Log (ULL) is defined as a digital   record of what learners have learned in their daily lives. To   simplify the process of capturing learners learning experiences,   SCROLL provides an easy-to-use interface. It adopts an approach   to share contents with other users based on a LORE (Log-  Organize-Recall-Evaluate) model proposed by Ogata et al. [21].   How the model supports each learning process is described as   below.    (1) Log: International students are likely to face some problems  such as how to read, write and pronounce words in their daily   life. They can save what they have learned with photo, such   as location (latitude and longitude), learning place, and date   and time of creation as a ULL as shown in Figure 1.   (2) Organize: When an international student adds a new ULL,  SCROLL compares it with his past ULL and those of other   users, categorize it and shows him related ULLs. By showing   it with information on when and where they learned it, past   learning and current learning can be linked and their   knowledge will be reorganized and reinforced [26].   (3) Recall: Learners are likely to forget what they have learned  before. It is necessary to support re-calling their past ULLs.   During this learning process, the system support learners to   recall what they have learned by using quiz.   (4) Evaluate: It is important to recognize what and how the  learner has learned by analyzing the past ULLs, so that he or   she can improve what and how to learn in the future. Mouri   et al. [12] developed an innovative visualization system that   implemented Time-Map [7], network graph based graph   theory in order to support this learning process.   3.2 Seamless Learning System based on e-Book   The above SCROLL is instantiated as the seamless learning   environment to support formal and informal language learning.   Figure 2 shows the design framework of our system that   integrated SCROLL with EPUB. There are two ways of   supporting learning activities in our framework:    (1) E-book-based learning activity: The teachers or instructors   create e-book contents using PowerPoint and Keynote before   class, and use them in their courses. The uploaded e-book   contents are converted to EPUB format and it is supported to   access the contents by using smartphone and PCs. After   international students choose a target e-book in their course   in accordance with their language level, they can read those   learning materials on their web browser using EPUB viewer   as shown in Figure 3. They can underline, mark unknown   words in the e-books, and save it using SCROLL (Figure 1).   In addition, they use the EPUB viewer to prepare before   class, and to review after class. Therefore, they can read the   learning materials not only during class but also outside class,   such as their home or libraries. Students action logs such as   opening a book, zooming, and page turning are collected into   E-book logs and learning materials database.   (2) Authentic learning activity: In out-of-class activity,   international students proactively observe things, grasp the   meanings and review on their daily encounters, and apply   their past experiences to other learning situations. For   example, when international students learn how to read, write   and create (passbook) in an e-book during class, then   they can actually apply their experience through the e-book   to their real-life experience at the bank with the tips from   SCROLL.   4 METHOD   4.1 Visualization in the Seamless Learning   Environment   In order to visualize and analyze learning logs accumulated in the   seamless learning environment, this paper uniquely defines them   as two types of three-layer structures as shown in Figure 4:   Formal Learning Structure (FLS) and Informal Learning Structure   (ILS). FLS includes three layers, which are called formal   Figure 1: Interface of adding a ULL.      .         Figure 2: Design of the Seamless learning system.      .                       learners, formal words, and learning materials.    (1) Formal learners: The upper layer shows learners studying in   a formal setting, such as lecture room and classroom.    (2) Formal words: The intermediate layer shows words that they   have learned in a formal setting using SCROLL with EPUB.   (3) Learning materials: The Lowest layer shows learning   materials uploaded by teachers or instructors.    In order to visualize the relationships among formal learner,   formal words and learning materials, this paper visualizes the   relationships using network directed graph. How our visualization   method connects relationships of each node For example, if a   learner learns and saves a newly learned word using SCROLL   with EPUB interface during class, our visualization method will   connect the learner node in the upper layer in the FLS to the   word node in the intermediate layer in FLS. Besides, the word   node will connect to the learning material nodes in the lowest   layer in FLS. By visualizing these links, teachers and students can   grasp which e-book and which page that word appears.   ILS includes three layers, which is called Informal learners,   Informal words, and Locations   (1) Informal Learners: The upper layer shows learners studying  in an informal setting such as museums, restaurants and city   halls.   (2) Informal words: The intermediate layer shows words that  they have learned in an informal setting using SCROLL.   (3) Locations: The lowest layer shows contextual data such as  location and place where they have learned in an informal   setting.   According to Mouri et al. [14], [15], how to connect the   relationships in ILS are as follows: If a learner learns and saves a   new word in an informal setting using SCROLL, it will connect   the learner node in the upper layer in ILS to the word node in the   intermediate layer in ILS. Then, the word node will connect to   the node of the location where they have learned it. For example,   if the learner learned natto (a traditional Japanese food made   from fermented soybeans) at the supermarket, it will connect   natto in the intermediate layer to supermarket in the lowest   layer.    In order to bridge the relationships between FLS and ILS, the   visualization will connect same words which appear in the   intermediate layers both in the FLS and ILS (e.g. natto in the   intermediate layer in FLS and natto in the intermediate layer in   ILS). The analytics using two types of three-layers have the   following advantages:    (1) On the FLS side, the formal words with a large number of  links to related learning materials mean students learned it in   many classes. For example, if a student learns the word   passbook using a learning material during class, the   Figure 4: Visualization methods in the seamless learning environments: Formal Learning Structure (FLS) and   Informal Learning Structure (ILS)   Figure 3: SCROLL with EPUB interface.      .            5   visualization informs them of other learning material context   where it is used. In addition, the formal words with a large   number of links to the formal learners mean words which   were learned by many students during class.   (2) On the ILS side, the informal words that are related to many  places are the words can be learned in various places. When   a learner experiences tea ceremony of a traditional Japanese   culture, for instance at the university, they are likely to learn   such tea ceremony related words as maccha (special tea for   tea ceremony), seiza (to sit in the correct manner on a   Japanese tatami mat). They can also be learned in other   places. Maccha can be learned at the supermarket, and the   seiza can be learned at the martial arts gym.   4.2 Seamless Learning System based on e-Book   Based on the network graph described above, this paper analyzes   using social network analysis as shown in Table 1.   Degree, closeness and betweenness centrality are a fundamental   measurement concept for the social network analysis [3], [9].   Especially, we hypothesize that betweenness centrality could be to   bridge the gap between formal learning and informal learning. For   example, if an international student learns word natto on e-book   content in a formal setting, it might be able to be applied to   various learning places such as supermarkets, shopping malls, and   restaurants in an informal setting. However, it is difficult for   him/her to know whether it can be learned in other learning   environments nor where it can be learned. In addition, it is   difficult to know which word could play the most important role   to bridge over formal and informal learning to realize the seamless   learning environments. By using betweenness centrality, this   analysis could find most important words between FLS and ILS   side.    Table 1: Social network analysis   Algorithm Formula (graph G:=(V,E) with V vertices   and E edges)   Details   Degree   =     1     Degree centrality is defined as the number of links incident upon   a node. That is, it is the sum of each row in the adjacency matrix   representing the network. N is the number of node and is the   degree of the node i.   Closeness   = () =    1   ,    Closeness centrality is that the distance of a node to all others in   the network. is the shortest path length between i and j, and     is the average distance from I to all the other nodes.   Betweenness   =  1  (  1)(  2)    ()     ,,     Betweenness centrality is that the number of shortest paths   between any two nodes that pass via a given node.  is the   number of the shortest path between j and k, and () is the   number of the shortest path between j and k that contains node i.      Figure 5: Visualization and analysis interface                 5 IMPLEMENTATION   5.1 Interface of VASCORLL   In the field of network graph studies, the majority of them have   focused on advantages such as good-quality results, flexibility,   simplicity, and interactivity.    For example, a network layout called force-directed uses the   force vector algorithm proposed in the Gephi software,   appreciated for its simplicity and for the readability of the network,   which helps visualization [4], [18]. A network layout called   Yifan Hu multilevel uses a very fast algorithm to reduce   complexity [5]. The repulsive forces on one node from a cluster of   distant nodes are approximated by a Barners-Hut calculation,   which treats them as one super-node [1].   On the other hand, Mouri et al. [16] proposed Ubiquitous   Learning Graph (ULG), which is divided into four areas: top-left,   top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. In their evaluation   experiment, they reported it is important to establish their nodes   position on the network graph for readability and ease-of-use   when visualizing the relationships in the real-world language   learning.   With these points in mind, we developed a network layout called   Seamless Learning Graph (SLG), which is divided into six areas   as shown in Figure 5: upper-left (Formal learners), center-left   (Formal words), bottom-left (Learning materials), upper-right   (Informal learners), center-right (Informal words), and bottom-  right (Locations). These areas represent the layers described in the   section 4.1.   As described in Section 4.2, the interface implements three   centrality based on social network analysis. From the (1) to (3)   buttons mean each centrality. By clicking them, VASCORLL will   automatically visualize and analyze all learning logs accumulated   in SCROLL with EPUB. The node size is based on the numerical   value of each centrality.    Figure 6 (left) shows the enlarged graph in both formal and   informal word areas. There are two learning scenarios by utilizing   the results of visualization, which are called Learning via formal   words and Learning via informal words as shown in Figure 6   (right).   (1) Learning via formal words: As shown in Figure 6 (left), the   word natto is the biggest size in the formal words areas. By   clicking it, the system moves to the page where the word   natto appears. That way, learners can grasp which e-book   and which page includes it.   (2) Learning via informal word: After learning natto in the e-  book contents, learners can find natto in the informal   words areas. By clicking it, the system moves to the ULLs   (natto pages of SCROLL) learned in the informal setting.   Unlike the above learning method (1), by utilizing the ULL,   they can learn other learners learning experiences (not only   words but also time, location and place information) that   Figure 6: The enlarged graph both formal and informal words area and each hyperlink      7   cannot be learned in the formal setting.   5.2 Color coding of the visualized nodes   To avoid having learners get confused when they see each node   since there are many visualized nodes, it is definitely necessary to   establish some criteria for the distinction of each node. To   effectively distinguish each node, we created a color coding   scheme for the nodes as shown in Table 2.   6 EVALUATION   6.1 Participants and Design   Twenty international students who are studying at the University of   Tokushima in Japan participated in the evaluation experiments.   They were from China, Malaysia, Thailand and Mongolia aged   from 21 to 36. Their length of stay in Japan ranged from 1 month to   5 years.    The evaluation experiment was designed to evaluate the following   three points:   (1) Whether VASCORLL can increase the participants learning   opportunities (Learning opportunities means that the number   of ULLs that the learner uploaded to the system during the   evaluation period).   (2) Whether VASCORLL would be benefit in terms of usability in   finding important words in the seamless learning environment.   (3) Which centrality is effective in supporting learning in the   seamless learning environment   6.2 Method   Figure 7 shows the experimental procedure.   Before the evaluation experiment began, a Japanese instructor   uploaded e-book contents to SCROLL server. The uploaded e-book   contents were created based on the JLPT. Since they had never used   SCROLL with EPUB before, they practiced using it for one week   before using VASCORLL. In addition, based on the uploaded ULLs   during the practice, the students were divided into two groups:   Group A (experimental group) and Group B (control group). Group   A consisted of 5 Chinese, 4 Mongolians and 1 Malaysian. Group B   consisted of 3 Chinese, 5 Mongolians and 2 Thais. Group A learned   words in their daily lives and words in the ebook contents using   SCROLL with EPUB and VASCORLL. Group B learned words in   their daily lives and words in the e-book contents using   SCROLLL with EPUB. Participants used their own smart-phones   (iPhone 4s or Android device) to upload their ULLs in a formal   and an informal setting anytime and anywhere. The mobile   devices used in the evaluation experiment were three iPhone 4s,   fourteen iPhone 5s, and three Samsung Galaxy Note 3s.   In the next phase, both Group A and B students evaluated, during   u-learning activity, each centrality based on social network   analysis. Participants learned words using three centrality: degree,   closeness, and betweenness. They were asked to use the   prearranged one centrality (e.g. participants firstly had to use   degree centrality for one day). After the evaluation experiment,   the participants were asked to complete five-point-scale   questionnaires to evaluate the system performance and usability,   as well as the user-friendliness of understanding the contents and   finding ULLs using each centrality in VASCORLL.   6.3 Result and Discussion   6.3.1 Whether VASCROLL can increase the participants  learning opportunities   In order to examine the increase of learning opportunities by   VASCORLL, we compared the number of the uploaded ULLs of   Group A with that of Group B using F-test. Table 3 shows the   number of ULLs that the participants uploaded during the   evaluation. In total, Group A students uploaded 189 ULLs and   Group B students uploaded 127 ULLs to the system. The means   and standard deviations were 18.9 and 6.41 for Group A, and 12.7   and 6.75 for Group B. It was found that the learning opportunities   of the two groups were significantly different with F = 4.41 (p   Table 2: Color coding to distinguish the kinds of nodes   Node Layer Node color   Formal learners Upper in FLS Red   Formal words Intermediate in FLS Yellow   Learning materials Lowest in FLS Blue   Informal learners Upper in ILS Pink   Informal words Intermediate in ILS Green   Locations Lowest in ILS Light blue      Table 3: Number of The Uploaded ULLs   Group Number   of ULLs   Mean SD Adjusted   mean   F   Group A 189 18.9 6.41 17.83 4.41   Group B 127 12.7 6.75 12.83       Figure 7: Experimental procedure                 < .05), implying that VASCROLL was able to increase their   learning opportunities. The adjusted mean of Group A (17.83) is   statistically higher than that of Group B (12.83). That means that   VASCORLL was a useful tool to increase their learning   opportunities.   6.3.2  Whether VASCROLL would be benefit in terms of in  finding important words   The results of a five-point-scale questionnaire are presented in   Table 4 (Best: 5, Worst: 1).    Q1 asks about whether the participants were able to find that the   words that they learned during class were connected to the words   that other learners learned outside class. Similarly, Q2 asks about   whether the participants were able to find that the words they have   learned outside class were connected to the words that others have   learned in class. The results of Q1 and Q2 revealed that the   participants found the relationships of words between formal and   informal learning. For example, some students learned Japanese   word,  (natto) in e-book contents in class. By uploading  natto to the system, the system could show them that other   students had learned it at the shopping mall and supermarkets.   That way VASCORLL was able to connect the words between   formal and informal learning.   Q3 asks about whether the participants were able to learn and find   the relationships between words and places by using VASCORLL.   For example, when a participant learned Japanese word,  (Cuisine) in class, he/she could find it was connected to the   experiences of others at places such as schools and restaurants. By   sharing the authentic experiences that are rarely able to acquire in   formal setting, VASCORLL enabled them to experience indirectly   what other people experienced thanks to the system, which   connected their formal learning to the informal one.   Q4 asks about whether the participants were able to find their   newly learned words in other e-book contents. For example, when   a participant learned  (Use) in an e-book material titled   Japanese Learning Beginner Vol.1, the system connected it to   other e-book materials such as Japanese Learning Beginner   Vol.2 and Onomatopoeia Japanese Learning Vol.1. That way,   they could learn that it is a frequently used word in the Japanese   language.   Q5 asks about whether VASCORLL was easy to use. They were   asked to evaluate the usability in terms of the operability and   readability of the visualized graph. The response shows that many   participants felt that VASCORLL was not easy to use. We asked   them to give comments regarding this problem. Examples of the   negative comments are as follows:   (1) The speed of visualizing and analyzing logs in the system is   too slow (It took about 20~30 sec.).   (2) If visualizing logs using a mobile device, it is hard to read   the nodes on the device because my screen is very small.   However, if logs are visualized on a personal computer, they   become very easy to read.   (3) It was a little bit difficult to understand how to use the   system.   From the comments (1) and (2), the participants would suggest   that the system developers need to improve functionality in   accordance with their mobile device and system speed in   visualizing a large mount of logs. The comment (3) shows that   even though we explained the usage of VASCORLL before the   evaluation experiment, some participants did not understand fully   how to use it. Thus, our next evaluation ought to be more   carefully planned.   6.3.3  Which centrality is effective in supporting seamless  learning   The results of five-point-scale questionnaire for evaluating each   centrality (degree, closeness and betweenness) are presented in   Table 5 (Best: 5, Wrong: 1). In addition, the participants were   asked questions such as Which centrality is the easiest in   understanding or finding central words and Which centrality is   the most effective for learning in order to evaluate each centrality   in the seamless learning environment.   Q1-Q3 asked about whether the participants were able to   understand and find central words using fundamental social   network analysis: degree centrality, closeness centrality, and   betweenness centrality. From the results of the questionnaire,   many participants preferred to learn and find central words using   betweenness centrality because the mean score of the Q3 is the   most highest.    In order to find the most effective centrality for them to learn   central words, we interviewed the participants to compare   betweenness centrality with other centrality.

Was the betweenness centrality easy   of understanding or finding central words   3.7 0.86         9   Degree centrality enabled the participants to find merely nodes   that have many links. Two participants selected the centrality in   terms of usability and effectiveness for learning because it is   simple and easy to understand the characteristics. However, some   participants commented that it was difficult to find words bridging   formal learning over informal learning. When comparing   betweenness centrality with the degree centrality, the processing   speed of betweenness centrality was little, but it was very useful   in finding central words which linked formal and informal   learning.   (2) Closeness centrality versus Betweenness centrality   When comparing closeness centrality with the closeness   centrality, the closeness centrality was not useful to find central   words in the seamless learning environment. There was no   numerical value difference between formal words in FLS and   informal words in ILS, so that the participants could not find   central words. Therefore, this paper concluded that the closeness   centrality was not a useful centrality in finding central words in   the seamless learning environment if using our visualization and   analysis method.   As shown in Figure 8, the majority of the participants preferred to   use betweenness centrality than other centrality. We asked them   why you preferred to the betweenness centrality than other   algorithms. Their feedbacks are as follows:    Because it is easy to find words in my e-book content  linking to informal words, the betweenness centrality is very   good.    It was easy to understand. And I learned some words.  Then, it recommended some useful words to me (e.g. the   size of green or yellow node).    The betweenness centrality turned out a very good centrality in   terms of easiness to find words bridging formal and informal   learning. In addition, we compared betweenness centrality with   other centrality. Fifteen answered that the betweenness centrality   is helpful to find central words in the seamless learning   environment. Seventeen answered it worked effectively in   language learning.   7 CONCLUSION   This paper described a system called VASCORLL for visualizing   and analyzing learning logs collected in the seamless learning   environment in order to bridge the gap between formal and   informal learning. VASCORLL works on cyber-physical setting   to link learners in the real world and learning logs that are   accumulated in the cyber spaces using the ubiquitous learning   system called SCROLL with EPUB. SCROLL with EPUB   enabled international students to learn through two learning   activities: e-book-based learning activity and authentic learning   activity.   Through those learning activities, we proposed visualization and   analysis methods based on graph theory, social network analysis   and graph drawing algorithms in order to find pivotal words in the   seamless learning environment. Two types of three-layer   structures called FLS and ILS were adapted as the visualization   methods. That way, teachers and students could easily grasp   words bridging between words in FLS and ILS. In addition, this   paper evaluated whether they were able to find the most pivotal   words on the network graph using each centrality based on social   network analysis.   The evaluation was conducted after the implementation of   VASCORLL. A questionnaire with a five-point-scale conducted   after the evaluation showed that VASCORLL was a useful tool to   find central words bridging formal and informal learning. The   result of questionnaires for evaluating each centrality showed the   most effective centrality for learning was betweenness centrality.   Therefore, we concluded that the betweenness centrality is the   most important centrality in the seamless learning environment.   VASCORLL will be evaluated repeatedly, with the processing   speed of visualizing and analyzing learning logs improved. In   addition, our future works include applying VASCORLL to other   application domains such as math, physics, and science education,   and long-term evaluations with an enough number of participants.   8 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   This part of this research was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for   Scientific Research No.25282059, No.26560122, No.25540091,   No.26350319 and No.16J05548 from the Ministry of Education,   Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan.
