This poster presents new features of Wikiglass   developed recently based on requests from teachers, including   flexible selection of date range, revision network, and thinking   order detection. Currently the new features are used and evaluated   in two secondary schools in Hong Kong.

INTRODUCTION  Wikiglass is a Learning Analytics (LA) tool for supporting   secondary and primary school teachers and students to monitor   student group collaborations on Wikis [1]. By retrieving page   content and revision history from Wiki platforms, Wikiglass   visualizes statistics of student contributions. It is one of the first   LA tools supporting Chinese text processing and customized for   secondary and primary schools. Wikiglass is now used in two   secondary schools in Hong Kong where students collaborate in   groups on inquiry-based projects over a period of three to five   months. There are two visualization modes in Wikiglass: statistics   and timeline. The former allows teachers and students to compare   statistics of student groups in one class or individual students in   one group (Figure 1), such as revision counts and word counts.   The timeline mode displays statistics accumulated by dates on a   weekly basis, allowing teachers and students to monitor progress   of groups or individual students over time [1]. During classroom   implementation of Wikiglass, teachers and students opinions and   suggestions have been solicited through individual or focus group   interviews, based on which new features have been developed,   including flexible selection of date range, revision network, and   thinking order detection from sentences.   2. FLEXIBLE DATE SELECTION   By default, statistics shown in Wikiglass are accumulated from the   start of the project period to the current time. During classroom   implementation, there came a request for the flexibility of   selecting a date range to examine student contributions, for   example, during the winter holidays. A calendar was then added   into the interface to allow date specification which was taken into   all calculations in the class, group, and individual levels (Figure   1). It is noteworthy that the selection of date ranges is propagated   to all pages in the statistics mode until a new date range or the   option All Time is selected.      Figure 1. Data selection enabled in all pages.   3. REVISION NETWORK   The group page in statistics mode reveals how much each student   in a group contributed to the project (the pie chart in Figure 1).   However, it cannot tell the interactions among the students, or   whether they have built upon each others work. To fill this gap, a   network is visualized based on the page revision histories in a   Wiki. Figure 2 shows an example network where each node   represents a student. The edges are directed, starting from the   student who revised a page and ending at the student whose   writing was modified. The thickness of an edge is proportional to   the times of revisions one student did to another students   writings. Therefore, this network helps not only in illustrating the   collaborative relationships among students, but also in identifying   active and inactive students.      Figure 2.

DETECTION OF THINKING ORDERS  Besides statistics on quantity of students contributions, the   teachers and students also raised a need for quality indicators of   students contributions. To meet the need, a new feature was   added to automatically detect the levels of thinking order (i.e.,   higher or lower levels) from student writings on Wiki.    4.1 Framework of thinking orders  Blooms taxonomy (BT) categorizes reasoning thinking into six   levels: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis,   synthesis, and evaluation [2]. BT has been used in assessing   cognitive thinking levels in student writings [3] [4]. In this study,   we used the adapted BT in [3] to analyze student writings in   Wikis, as shown in Table 1.    Table 1. Levels of thinking order adapted from [3].   Thinking   Order   Bloom Taxonomy Possible purposes of   writing   High Evaluation   Synthesis   Reasoning,   Argumentation,   Evaluating, etc.   Medium Analysis   Application   Data interpretation,   Comparison, etc.   Low Comprehension   Knowledge   Definition,   Information statement,   Action description, etc.   4.2 Automated text categorization  As student writings are of a significant amount and generated in a   continuous manner, automated detection of thinking order from   writings is necessary. For this purpose, a text categorization   model was trained and evaluated on an annotated corpus which   was built from writings of previous students in one of the schools   using Wikiglass. It maximizes the generalizability of the model to   new writings of students in later cohorts, by using previous   students writings on the same subject and in the same school.    To build the categorization model, a range of text features were   extracted from each sentence, including lexical, syntactic, and   semantic features [5]. Multiple text categorization algorithms   were experimented and compared. The results showed that   Support Vector Machines (SVM) plus the randomized logistic   regression (RLR) feature election method achieved the best   performance (accuracy = 0.81; kappa = 0.58) which was then   integrated into Wikglass.   4.3 Visualizing thinking orders  Student writings on Wikis were first downloaded from Wiki   platforms. Once a new version of a page was recorded, the new   content on top of the last version was detected. Each sentence in   the new content then underwent the feature extraction and text   categorization process. The predicted levels of thinking orders   (i.e., high, medium, or low) were then saved into the database and   aggregated for visualizations. Statistics are shown in similar ways   as in Figure 1.    To enable closer examinations on the content of the sentences,   Wikiglass also allows teachers and students to view the actual   sentences and corresponding levels of thinking orders detected by   Wikiglass. In addition, teachers also have the authority to modify   the level of thinking orders if they think a predicted level is   inaccurate (Figure 3). The changes will not only be immediately   reflected on the screen, but also be taken as teachers feedback   and recorded by the system. The feedback will be used for   incrementally training the text categorization model, to further   improve the performance of categorization models over time [6].        Figure 3. Visualization of sentences and thinking orders   5. ONGOING WORK  Wikiglass is currently being used by two secondary schools in   Hong Kong, with a total of 602 students and 11 teachers. The   effectiveness of the tool and especially the new functions will be   evaluated through user survey, interviews as well as system log   analysis. Meanwhile, more schools are interested in adopting   Wikiglass in their classrooms. We are planning to evaluate the   efficacy of Wikiglass and LA in general with younger students in   primary schools.
