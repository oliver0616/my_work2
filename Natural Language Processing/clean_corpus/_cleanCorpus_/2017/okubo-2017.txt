These systems enable us to collect many types of   log data that corresponds to learning activities of students. By   analyzing these logs using data mining techniques, we can   determine learning patterns of students, which helps teachers in   detecting at-risk students ([1]). At Kyushu University, a   learning support system called the M2B system was introduced in   October 2014. The M2B system consists of three subsystems, the   e-learning system Moodle, the e-portfolio system Mahara, and the   e-book system BookLooper provided by Kyocera Maruzen, Inc.   Using the logs of these systems, a number of investigations have   been conducted ([3], [4], [5]).

In this paper, we propose a method for   predicting students final grades by a neural network approach,   using the log data of the M2B system. Particularly, in order to   treat time series data of each week in a course, we use a variant of   a neural network, called a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) ([2]).   By comparing our results with the result obtained using regression   analysis, we show the performance of prediction of students final   grades using RNN.   2 DATA COLLECTION   We collected the learning logs of 108 students attending   Information Science course, which started in April 2016. In this   course, the teacher and students used the LMS, the e-portfolio   system and the e-book system. The students were required each   week to submit a report, to answer a quiz, to write a logbook of a   lecture, and to read slides for preview and review using the three   systems. The logs of these learning activities were automatically   graded by the system based on the criteria shown in Table 1:         Activities 5 4 3 2 1 0   Attendance  Atten  dance     Being   late      absen  ce   Quiz (rate of   collect answer)   Above   80%   Above   60%   Above   40%   Above   20%   Above   10%  o.w.

Criteria for grading learning activities           3 RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK   A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) handles time series data.   Unlike a general Neural Network, an RNN has a recursive loop as   shown in Figure 1. The RNN propagates the internal information   previous time at the current time, and obtains the output value   based on the current information and the past information. Thus, it   is possible to output in consideration of the past state.   The parameters of the RNN are trained by Backpropagation   through time (BPTT). The BPTT propagates the error between the   ground truth and the output at time t tracing back to time t-1.   Similarly, an error at time t-1 is propagated at time t-2, and   training is performed retroactively. Although the RNN   theoretically can output with consideration of all the past   information, in fact, the error is not able to propagate to far past.   Therefore, it is an output considering only the information of the   past several times.   To address this problem, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is   employed as a unit in middle layer that stores long term   information. The LSTM has a memory for storing the internal   state. The memory information stored in LSTM is kept efficient   information or deleted discard information by input or internal   state at previous time. In this paper, LSTM is used as a middle   layer unit of RNN.   4 CONCLUSIONS   For each 1i15, the RNN was trained by the log data until the i-  th week, that consisted of a vector of nine kinds of grades of each   week shown in Table 1 (treated as input), and the final grade A, B,   C, D, or F of students (treated as output).  Using the obtained   RNN, the prediction of the final grades of students was performed.   We also examined the prediction of final grade using multiple   regression analysis, where the final grades A, B, C, D, and F were   replaced by 95, 85, 75, 65, and 55, respectively. For each 1i15,    the multiple regression analysis using the data until the i-th week   was performed. Moreover, by using the multiple regression   equation, the final grades were predicted. The accuracy of    prediction by the RNN and the accuracy of prediction by the      multiple regression analysis together with the value of adjusted R2   are summarized in Table 2.  We can observe that the accuracy by    the RNN is above 90% using the data until 6th week, while the   accuracy by the multiple regression analysis is less than 90%   using the data until 9th week. Hence, it can be said that RNN is   effective for early prediction of final grades. We remark that the   learning activities that contribute to obtain a certain grade can be   inferred from the weight of the obtained RNN.   5 CONCLUSION   In this paper, we proposed a method for predicting final grades of   students by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from the log data   stored in the educational systems. The log data represented the   learning activities of students who used the learning management   system, the e-portfolio system, and the e-book system. We applied   this method to the log data from 108 students. The accuracy of   prediction by the RNN is above 90% using the log data until 6th   week. This fact shows that comparing with multiple regression   analysis, RNN is effective to early prediction of the final grades.
