Written discourse is arguably the primary class of data  that can give us insights into deeper learning and higher order  qualities such as critical thinking, argumentation, mastery of  complex ideas, empathy, collaboration and interpersonal skills.  Moreover, the ability to write in a scholarly manner is a core  competence, often taking the form of discourse with oneself and  the literature. Computational linguistics research has developed a  rich array of tools for machine interpretation of human discourse,  but work to develop these tools in the context of learning is at a  relatively early stage. Moreover, there is a significant difference  between designing tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis,  and their deployment on platforms to provide meaningful  analytics for the learners and educators who are conducting that  discourse. This workshop aims to catalyse ideas and build  community connections among those who want to shape this field.

It is central  to the collaborative and social learning that takes place online and  there is a correspondingly significant literature on discourse  analysis for online learning/CSCL. Computer-supported discourse  ranges from unconstrained forms of interaction to more structured  forms, where structuring refers to the constraints that the user  interface places on how one contributes (eg flat commenting,  threaded forums, blogging, argument mapping...).    Computational linguistics research in academia and business (eg.  IBMs Watson) has developed a rich array of automated tools for  machine interpretation of human discourse, but work to develop  these tools in the context of learning is at a relatively early stage.  Moreover, there is a significant difference between the use of such  tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis, and their  deployment on platforms in order to provide meaningful analytics  for learners and educators.  We argue, therefore, that an important class of learning analytic  will emerge at the intersection of research into learning dynamics,  deliberation platforms, and computational linguistics. What will  make these learning analytics, as opposed to research that sits in  any of the above categories, will be their use to generate  information displays that help learners and/or educators to  understand where significant discourse patterns are happening and  that support interventions to improve discourse for learning.   It is hoped that this workshop will provide the opportunity to frge  productive new connections between researchers from the above  fields, in order to ensure that Learning Analytics research is  informed by the best possible minds.    http://www.solaresearch.org/events/lak/lak13/dcla13         Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
