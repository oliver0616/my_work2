The CLA toolkit harvests data about student participation in specified learning activities across standard social media environments, and presents informa- tion about the nature and quality of the learning interac- tions.

THE CONNECTED LEARNING ANALYT- ICS TOOLKIT  The Connected Learning Analytics Toolkit (CLA Toolkit) aims to improve the quality of student engagement and learn- ing in collaborative online environments [8]. It does so by in- corporating and analysing data from social media platforms that the majority of students already use in their personal lives, and increasingly make use of in education. The toolkit addresses prior challenges associated with teaching outside of the Learning management system (LMS) by allowing for data to be collated and visualised across a suite of educa- tion technologies and social media that any teacher could choose as fit for purpose. Students sign up to have their data collected for a series of pre-specified learning activities, a move that preserves student privacy [9], and goes some way towards a model of data ownership where the student controls access to their data [5]. Upon logging in, students are presented with a dashboard (see Fig. 1) that helps them to examine their participation in almost real time.

Collected data is stored in the Experience API (xAPI) format, and so any analytics system making use of this format could extend the data capture functionality of the CLA toolkit to its specific purpose. The analytics functionality of the CLA toolkit is implemented by extracting xAPI statements in JSON form and storing them in a PostgreSQL database that can be queried as needed. This has allowed us to im- plement a number of standard analytics and dashboards. At present we have taken inspiration from SNAPP [2], LOCO- Analyst [1] and Social Learning Analytics [10], to develop a set of dashboards that help (i) students to explore the na- ture of their online social interactions, and (ii) instructors to find and interpret patterns of behaviour in a class.  The student facing dashboard (Fig. 1) currently includes an activity report that relates to their individual participa- tion, a word cloud of concepts discussed by that student, and first degree social network analysis (higher order connections can be extracted, but are currently not reported to students to respect their privacy and current ethical approvals). This dashboard helps students to explore the nature of their on- line interactions using a number of filtering options, which allow them to examine particular time frames, or interac- tions with specific students.  Instructors currently see more analytics due to both pri- vacy concerns, and the fact that the algorithms we are using require larger datasets than are normally available to indi- viduals. Firstly, an aggregated Activity Dashboard (Fig. 2)    Figure 2: The Activity Dashboard.  Figure 3: The Instructor facing SNA Dashboard.  can be used to both investigate behavioural patterns in a class, filter the other reports (i.e., SNA and Content Anal- ysis), and to access the student dashboards for people in their class. The Instructor facing Social Network Analysis (Fig. 3) displays the type of connections occurring between people signed up to the system (description is unified using the Connected Learning Recipe [7]), and also allows for drill down examination of sub-connections and interactions. The Content Analysis dashboard shown to instructors (Fig. 4) currently includes a basic word cloud; Topic Modelling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm; sentiment anal- ysis [4]; and a Cognitive Presence classification from the Community of Inquiry model [3].  2. THE DEMONSTRATION The current state of the dashboards available in the CLA  toolkit can be explored by anyone in a trial account at: http://clatoolkit.beyondlms.org/  username: trialAccount  password: tryoutCLAtoolkit  This Demonstration will exhibit current capabilities, as well as giving attendees assistance in registering for a LAK16 course which will help them track their engagement with the  Figure 4: Content Analysis Dashboard  conference.  3.
