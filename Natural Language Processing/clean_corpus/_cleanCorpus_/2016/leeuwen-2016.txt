Learning analytics were used both  within the course to facilitate effective teacher-student interaction,  as well as after the course to examine patterns between students  activities during the course and their performance on the test and  the group assignment at the end of the course.

INTRODUCTION  Blended learning (BL) is defined as the combination of online and  face-to-face learning activities [1]. BL has many possible forms of  implementation, differing according to the ordering, frequency,  and type of teacher-learner interaction within these activities.    One type of BL that is increasingly often implemented in higher  education is the so called Flipped Classroom, in which students  rotate on a fixed schedule between face-to-face teacher-guided  practice on campus and online delivery of content and instruction  of the same subject from a remote location (often home) after  school [1]. In this context, online activities serve as a tool for  studying learning materials in preparation for face-to-face  meetings, so that more time can be spent on practicing skills and  receiving feedback instead of rather than a teacher explaining the  material. The main idea is that each medium  face-to-face and  online settings  is used optimally: face-to-face meetings for  interaction and feedback with a teacher, and the online medium to  study material in a variety of ways, making use of the possibilities  of for example multimedia and discussion fora [2].   Because BL involves online learning activities, there are  opportunities to automatically log and analyze these activities and  use the results to further enhance learning and teaching processes,  for example by providing the teacher with summaries of students  activities [3]. When student data are used in this way, this is  called learning analytics (LA) [4]. Within the present study, LA  are used in two ways.    First of all, within the course, LA are used as indicated above,  namely to inform teachers of students online activities. Secondly,  on a higher level, LA are used to examine the relationship  between students activities and their final performance within the  course. The results may then be used in the subsequent year to  predict and timely intervene when students show behavior  indicating the possibility of failing the course [5].     Thus, we investigate the usefulness of LA during the course, but  also use LA techniques at the end of the course to examine  relationships between process and outcome of learning. These two  aspects are reflected in the two research questions.   Research questions:    To what extent do blended learning elements and the use  of  learning analytics enhance teaching and learning processes during  the course   What is the relationship between (online and face-to-face)  learning activities and (individual and group) performance in the  course   2. METHOD  2.1 Course description   The course under study is about Educational Design, and was  offered at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Between 100 and  150 bachelor students are registered for the course. The goals of  the course are for students to gain theoretical knowledge about  designing processes, as well as for them to practice these skills by  working on designing an actual training as requested by a  company or school in the Universitys network. Besides working  on this collaborative assignment, students also complete an  individual test at the end of the course.   2.2 Blended elements / Course design  The course consists of the following weekly activities (see Figure  1). First of all, there are plenary lectures, for which the students  prepare in two ways. They are supposed to 1) study the material  belonging to that weeks topic, either by reading the book or by  viewing the web lectures that explain the same content, and 2) to  formulate one question about the material for other students to test  whether they understood the material.   In the lecture, the focus is on deepening understanding of the  material by offering insights from recent research and by offering  practical examples.

In  these sessions, the questions that students formulated are used as  formative assessments. The answers to the questions are given by  means of electronic voting system, which means the teacher is  able to see at a glance which answers are given most. Each  question and its possible answers are discussed. The remainder of  the working group is devoted to working on the group  assignment.     Preparation   Lecture  Working   group  - Viewing web  lectures /  studying book   - Formulating  one question  about the  material    - Deepening  understan- ding of  course  material    - Formative  assessment  - Discussion of  course material  - Working on  group  assignment     Figure 1: Weekly schedule of activities within the course.      2.3 Learning analytics within the course  During the course, teachers will be provided with summaries of  students activities in two ways. First of all, teachers are able to  see how often the web lectures are viewed, and which parts of the  web lecture are re-viewed most (see Figure 2) [6]. This could  indicate that particular concepts need additional explanation  during the working groups. Furthermore, teachers receive  immediate information on students performance on the formative  assessments, because students participate in these tests using  electronic voting systems.       Figure 2: Dashboard of web lecture viewing patterns.   2.4 Collected data  Data is collected about each type of activity, see Table 1. Viewing  of web lectures is automatically logged by the system (see section  2.3). Attendance of the lectures is obtained by manually keeping a  list each week. The questions that students submit for the  formative assessment are coded for the type of question using  Blooms taxonomy (for example, questions concerning definitions  of concepts versus applying concepts). The performance on  formative assessments during the working groups is also  automatically logged (see section 2.3). The performance measures  are obtained by teacher grading of both individual tests and group  product.  Teacher usage of LA that are provided to them is investigated by  means of teacher interviews. Students perceptions of the  effectivity of BL elements in the course are examined using focus  group interviews.   Table 1: Overview of collected data.

ANALYSIS / EXPECTED RESULTS  3.1 Using learning analytics within the course  To investigate whether the use of blended learning and LA  enhanced teaching and learning processes (research question 1),  we will code the student and teacher interviews using thematic  analysis and combine these with the observed activities during the  course. This will lead to a qualitative description of the teaching  and learning processes that occurred during the course.    3.2 Learning analytics at overall course level  To investigate patterns between learning activities and course  performance (research question 2), we will use the individual test  grade and group performance grade as dependent variables, and  the learning activities as outlined in Table 1 as independent  variables in a structural equation model.    4. PRESENTATION AT LAK16  The course in which the data is collected will run from February 8  until April 15, 2016, which means we will have just finished data  collection at the start of the LAK16 conference. Preliminary  analyses will be presented, especially concerning the within  course use of learning analytics (see section 3.1)., and the opinion  of other scholars will be welcome in deciding on the analyses at  course level (section 3.2).   5.
