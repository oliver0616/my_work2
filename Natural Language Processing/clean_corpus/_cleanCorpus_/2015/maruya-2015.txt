We propose a learning system,  called the finger trail learning system (FTLS), that can monitor  participants learning attitude by means of their finger  movements. On the display of the FTLS, letters are presented  with low contrast in the initial state, and the contrast of the  letters changes to high when they are traced by learners. We  implemented the FTLS as an iOS application and confirmed  that the software can be utilized to monitor learners attitudes.  In addition, we compared trails of finger movements between  participants with high and low performance. The results show  that the trail of finger movements recorded by the FTLS can be  an index of learners attitudes.

INTRODUCTION  In the current paper, we propose a system for learning text  materials, called the finger tracing learning system (FTLS). The  FTLS is developed based on an interactive dynamic text display  format using users finger tracing (Figure 1) [6]. In the initial state,  the contrast of the letter is set low and the displayed letters are  barely visible. When learners trace the display, the contrast of  letters under the touched area increases gradually and reaches the  maximum level. The contrast of touched letters stays at the  maximum level until the user reset the contrast of all letters into   the initial state by pressing a software reset button. As shown in  Figure 1, texts displayed with this dynamic method can be mixed  with texts displayed with a conventional static method. The  software can record touched positions on the display continuously.        Figure. 1. Dynamic text displays      The FTLS may appear to be ordinary, since this system is  apparently similar to systems in which the contrast of letters is  changed a button press. However, tracing requires continuous  commitment to the learning materials whereas a button press is  finished in an instant and provides little information. The trail of  the tracing would contain richer information than a simple button  press. The FTLS may also be somewhat similar to highlighting a  text using some tool. The learner, however, cannot see the text  until they touch it. A merit of this system with a dynamic text  display [2, 4, 7] is that the learner is strongly motivated to actively  trace the learning materials. Without the learners self-motivation,  a learning program using this system does not work.   Using the FTLS, The teacher can monitor learners reading  behaviors by viewing their finger movement data. Analyses of the  reading speed and acceleration at locations of texts is useful to  grasp the extent that the learner focuses on the learning materials.  The level of comprehension depends on reading speed. This  dependency was also observed in the reading from screens [1, 5].  Also, it is often reported that reading from computer screen is  skimming, i.e. the reading is fast and desultory rather than in  detail [3]. In the FTLS, the learner should read the materials by  tracing the text carefully from the beginning to the end. The  focusing of learners attention is indispensable for ensuring good  tracing behavior that can be monitored both in online and offline  manners. These characteristics prohibit learners skimming and  promote learners to read the text slowly. This slowdown in  reading rate would lead better understanding of the reading  materials.

EXAMINATION OF THE FTLS IN THE  CLASSROOM  In this study, we examined the effectiveness of the FTLS by  recording the students finger movements, when they learn using  it. In addition, we compared trails of finger movements between  participants with high and low performance.   2.1 Procedures  The lecture described a safety training program for laying  telephone lines and lasted about 65 minutes. The lecture targeted  young employees of Nippon Telegram and Telephone  Corporation with little knowledge about safety in the laying  operation.    In the lecture, learners were instructed to trace the text displayed  on their own iPad screen according to teachers reading. The  contrast of most of the words (without section titles and leading  texts) was set very low so that the words were barely visible. The  contrast of letters under the touched area increased gradually and  reached the maximum level in 2 sec. The key words of the  contents were highlighted in red. Short sets of a lecture and  review with the FTLS, each of which lasted 1 to 5 minutes, were  performed 11 times, and then ten minutes were provided for  learners to review all contents.    The class ended with a memory test and questionnaire. In the  memory test, learners were asked to recall the 71 key words to fill  blanks in the text displayed on the laptop PC. The tracing  behaviors of the learners were recorded throughout the lecture.  The number of learners was 47. To compare the results for the  FTLS (tracing condition), a lecture was also given to another 42  learners without using the FTLS. These learners just viewed the  same material with a static text display consisting of letters with  the highest contrast (seeing condition).   2.2 Results  We pooled the scores of the memory tests for each condition  (tracing/seeing) and averaged the scores across participants  (Figure 2a). The mean score for the tracing condition was  significantly larger that for the seeing condition (t(75)=2.57,  p=.012).    Next, we superimposed tracing data from five learners who got  higher (>85 %) scores and compared them with data from five  learners who got lower (< 50 %) scores (Figure 2b). The amount  of finger tracing was generally more in the higher-score group  than in the lower-score group. These results suggest that the  appropriate tracing behavior enhanced the learners performance.    Thus, the results show that the FTLS generally enhances the  performance of learners.  When a learner uses the FTLS, they are  required to attend to the display to perform appropriate finger  movements.  In addition, a pilot observation showed that the time  to read the text by tracing is generally longer than the time to read  the text silently. These characteristics of reading with tracing  behavior make the relationship between the learner and learning  materials deeper and more active than in silent reading.         Figure. 2.

When the  number of learners increases, monitoring by the teacher becomes  difficult. An automatic monitoring system would help in the  promotion of learning in a large-scale classroom. The finger  position data were considerably different among learners. The  extent of learners active attitudes may be reflected in some  features of the tracing data, such as the length of the trace, the  total amount of acceleration in the tracing finger movement, and  the frequency with which important words are traced. A detailed  analysis of the relationship between these features in the tracing  data and the learning performance would be the next step. The  quantitative relationship between the tracing data and the learning  performance would be a basis for automatically monitoring  learners behavior to support the teachers role in both classical  and online education.   4.
