The study of common and consequential   sequences of events (such as learners accessing resources,   interacting with other learners and engaging in self-regulatory   activities) and how these are associated with learning outcomes,   as well as the ways in which knowledge and skills grow or evolve   over time are both core areas of interest. Learning analytics   datasets are replete with fine-grained temporal data: click streams;   chat logs; document edit histories (e.g. wikis, etherpads); motion   tracking (e.g. eye-tracking, Microsoft Kinect), and so on.   However, the emerging area of temporal analysis presents both   technical and theoretical challenges in appropriating suitable   techniques and interpreting results in the context of learning. The   learning analytics community offers a productive focal ground for   exploring and furthering efforts to address these challenges. This   workshop, the fourth in a series on temporal analysis of learning,   provides a focal point for analytics researchers to consider issues   around and approaches to temporality in learning analytics.

WORKSHOP BACKGROUND  The temporal component of learning has typically been   underexplored in both applied and research contexts [15, 18, 19].   This is a complex issue; temporality involves consideration of   duration, sequence, pace, and salience of target events [21, 27], in   addition to consideration of accretion over time [10, 15, 18]. For   example, while many discussions around MOOCs emphasize   student retention rates by simply counting students online   actions, the analysis of temporal patterns in the clickstream data   tracking student actions has the potential to uncover deeper   insights and provide greater predictive power [4, 13].    Measures and methods for characterizing and analyzing the   temporal evolution of dynamics of group interactions are needed   and emerging [1, 3, 7, 24]. Despite the relative ease of access   learning analytics researchers have to process data (through log   files for example), relatively little research has made use of this   temporal information [24], with most research opting for a   coding and count strategy [as discussed in 25, 28]. With the rise   of online learning and available trace data, the availability of data   for analysis is growing [9], but we should be mindful that bigger   is not necessarily richer; methodological and conceptual work is   needed to develop analytic approaches that leverage the temporal   features of these data sets to make increasingly sophisticated   knowledge claims and diagnostic assessments about learning [23].   In addition new approaches are needed to integrate analysis of   data streams, thereby revealing how phenomena (e.g., mouse   clicks, utterances, gazes, gestures, persistent representations such   as diagrams) co-occur, interact, and facilitate learning, and   furthermore, show how they dynamically affect one another over   time. Such analyses can help reveal dynamic relationships and   support the development of theory and design principles [2].   We are not only interested in how sequences of click-stream data   are related to learning outcomes, but why. Moreover, the   separation of data within clickstreams  which clicks are   associated, how they are chunked into meaningful sequences, and   what objects are available to click  are related to a theorized   account of data representation and segmentation. Greater   understanding of temporality is key here; the very understanding   of an episode or event is tied to temporal notions around the   demarcation of meaningful segments. Issues are more complex   yet, in addition to temporal analyses which consider the   arrangement of events within sequences and the organization of   multiple events over time, there are those which explore time as a   continuous flow of events, examining their positioning, rates, and   duration [20]. Both approaches raise complex questions around   operationalization and data collection [26].    Much recent work (for example the use of use of lag sequential   analysis [8, 22] in [used in 5], t-patterns [16, 17] in [14], pattern-  analyses [e.g. used in 12], and Markov models [see recent   inclusion in the analytic techniques of, 6]) has focused on analysis   Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are   not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that   copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

While   t-pattern analysis can be used to explore longer, more temporally   separated sequences than LSA and Markov models, all these   techniques are best suited to relatively short recurring sequences   and analysis of event transitions [24]. Therefore, other approaches   will be needed for temporal analysis of accretion and flow or   development over time. For example, in analysis of the unstable   and evolving nature of topics in dialogue, Introne and Dreschler   take as their unit of analysis a sequence of replies, seek[ing] to   understand how clusters of words in these reply sequences   change, merge, and split [11]. Here their interest is in modelling   the statistical properties of the co-occurrence of words over time,   as opposed to modelling probabilities based on dictionary entries   or other corpora. Regardless of focus, fundamental to these   examples is the bringing together of both analytic and theoretical   accounts. The learning analytics community offers a productive   focal ground for exploring and furthering such efforts through its   positioning at the nexus of learning and analytic concerns.   2.
