Increasing the Accessibility of Learning Objects by Automatic Tagging  Katja Niemann Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT  Schloss Birlinghoven Sankt Augustin, Germany  katja.niemann@fit.fraunhofer.de  ABSTRACT Data sets coming from the educational domain often suffer from sparsity. Hence, they might comprise potentially use- ful learning objects that are not findable by the users. In order to address this problem, we present a new way to auto- matically assign tags and classifications to learning objects offered by educational web portals that is solely based on the objects usage.

INTRODUCTION Many educational web portals allow users and domain ex- perts to manually enrich the learning resources with social metadata like free-text tags or classifications from a con- trolled vocabulary. This social metadata provides power- ful knowledge that can be used to improve the quality of searching and recommendations [2]. Nevertheless, data sets coming from the domain of technology enhanced learning often suffer from sparsity in respect to semantic and social metadata describing the learning objects which hinders their accessibility and impedes their recommendation [4].  In order to deal with this problem, we propose to automati- cally exchange tags and classifications between similar learn- ing objects. Here, the similarity of two objects is calculated by comparing their usage contexts, i.e. the objects they were most often used with. This way, our approach is different from well-known approaches for automatic tagging that base on the objects content or on tag co-occurrences [1, 2].

Chapter 2 presents our proposed approach. Chapter 3 introduces the data set that is used for the evaluation which results are discussed in chap- ter 4. Finally, chapter 5 gives a conclusion.  2. APPROACH 2.1 Usage Context-based Object Similarity We assume two learning objects to hold a semantic rela- tion if they are often used in the same usage contexts, i.e. together with the same co-occurrences. Figure 1 shows two exemplary user sessions from two different users. Both users access a text documents describing the Grand Palais and a picture showing the Centre Pompidou. Thereafter, the first user accesses a video about Renzo Piano while the second user opens a text document having Richard Rogers as topic. This means that the learning objects about Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers are not used together but they are used in similar usage contexts, i.e. together with the same learn- ing objects. Hence, the learning objects about Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers are assumed to hold a semantic rela- tion. This is in fact true, as they denote those two architects who designed the Centre Pompidou together. This example shows how the knowledge of the users is implicitly given by their activities and can be exploited without asking them to explicitly share it. A detailed description of this approach can be found in [3].  Figure 1: Exemplary user sessions  2.2 Automatic Tagging The automatic tagging is a process that is conducted in three steps. First, all pair-wise similarities between the learning objects are calculated based on their usage. Second, for each object all tags and classifications that are assigned to a sim- ilar object are selected as candidate tags. In order for two objects to be assumed to be similar their similarity must ex- ceed a pre-defined threshold. Third, the candidate tags are weight and only the most promising ones are selected. The weight of a tag or classification in respect to a learning object is calculated by accumulating and normalising the similarity values of all objects that hold this tag or classification and are similar to the selected learning object.  414    3. DATA SET The MACE (Metadata for Architectural Contents in Eu- rope) portal enables users to search for learning objects across repository boundaries and filter the results, e.g. ac- cording to their language, the original repository, and the classification terms they hold. 78.69% of the 12,442 learning resources accessed so far hold semantic metadata, i.e. 70.8% hold tags, 14.83% hold classifications, and 8.82% hold both in which each tagged learning resource holds on average 6.59 tags and each classified learning resource holds on average 2.27 classifications. As the tags are free text, about 73% of the 13,291 distinct tags are only used once and only about 4% of the tags are added to more than 10 objects. This shows the speciality of the tags which impedes the discov- ery of the objects they describe. The classification values are slightly more equally distributed with about 39% of the classifications being only used once and about 77% of the classifications being used at maximum 5 times.  4. EVALUATION In the conducted experiment we assumed two objects to be similar as soon as their usage-based similarity is higher than zero while the threshold t, i.e. the weight a tag or classifi- cation must exceed in order to be added to a new learning object, is varied from 0.1 to 1.0. This way, the number of tagged learning objects (i.e. 8,620) raises by at least 8% (9,309 tagged objects with t=1.0) up to 25% (10,783 tagged objects with t=0.1). Additionally, the number of tags an object holds on average increases drastically. When setting the threshold t to its maximum, a tagged object holds on average 34.72 tags while with a lower threshold, the number of tags per object raises up to 680.06 (with t=0.1). Further- more, the number of classified objects (i.e. 1,806) increases by 19% (2,144 classified objects with t=1.0, each holding on average 2.72 classifications) up to 245% (6,229 classified objects with t=0.1, each holding on average 7.59 classifica- tions).  The number of tags that were only assigned to one ob- ject halve through the automatic tagging process, i.e. from 73.33% (9,746) to 37.1% (4,930). In turn, the percentage of the tags that are used 2-100 times increases from 26.24% (3,487) to 56.65% (7,530). Though, the percentage of tags that are assigned to more than 100 objects only increases from 0.44% (58) to 6.25% (831). This shows that indeed the rarely used tags are assigned more often to learning objects and not (only) the already frequently used ones. The same effect can be observed for the classifications. The percent- age of classifications that are only used once decreases from 38.59% (336) to 19.06% (166) in the MACE data set. The percentage of classifications used 2-5 times only increases slightly from 38% (331) to 44.55% (368). Finally, 36.62% of the classifications are assigned to 10-100 objects after the au- tomatic tagging while the number of classifications assigned to more than 100 objects stays the same.  In order to evaluate the quality of the automatic added tags and classifications we use them to calculate rating predic- tions. Figure 2 shows the mean average error (MAE) and the coverage (i.e. number of user-item pairs in the test set for which a rating can be predicted) of the content-based recommender systems for the MACE data set and varying thresholds. It can be seen that the coverage increases with  a decreasing threshold. This is due to the fact that more tags and classifications can be assigned to the learning ob- jects which leads to more content-based object relations. The MAE increases as well with an increasing threshold. However, the MAE can even be improved compared to the baseline if the threshold is high enough. Finally, the classifi- cations neither increase the MAE nor the coverage as much as the tags. This can be motivated by the fact that less classifications than tags are added.  baseline tags + classifications added tags added classifications added  0.5  0.52  0.54  0.56  0.58  0.6  0.62  0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1  m e  a n   a v  e ra  g e   e rr  o r  threshold  (a) Mean average error  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90  95  100  0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1  co v e ra g e  threshold  (b) Coverage  Figure 2: Performance of the content-based recommender  5. CONCLUSION We proposed a new way to automatically enhance the se- mantic metadata representations of learning objects offered by educational web portals to enhance their accessibility. This is done by exchanging tags and classifications between the objects based on the objects usage context-based simi- larities. Thus, no content information about the objects is needed to detect similarities. We found that this way even learning objects that previously did not hold any tags or classifications could be automatically tagged and classified. Furthermore, we found that especially the rarely used tags and classifications were assigned to new objects.  6.
