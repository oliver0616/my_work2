The model is applied to  automatically extract forum posts semantics for uncovering the  content latent structures. We further prototype a visual analytics  interface to present online discussion forum semantics. We  hypothesize that the semantic modeling through analytics on open  online discussion forums can help users examine the post content  by viewing the summarized topic facets. Our preliminary results  demonstrated that TFM can be a promising method to extract  topic specificity from conversational and relatively short texts in  online programming discussion forums.

INTRODUCTION Forums or discussion boards are popular trouble- shooting/problem-solving technologies for online courses. In  current programming language learning, students are exposed to a  lot of help in preparing code (readings, intelligent tutorials,  worked examples etc.), as well as in-situ support during coding  exercises (e.g., debuggers, unit tests, dynamic code examples,  dialogue tutor etc.) (Barnes & Stamper, 2008; Boyer et al., 2011;  Brandt, Dontcheva, Weskamp, & Klemmer, 2010; Brusilovsky,  2001; Pirolli & Anderson, 1985). Free online discussion sites (i.e.  stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com), Dream.In.Code  (http://www.dreamincode.net), etc.) allow programmers and  learners to reach out for help so that they can freely discuss   programming problems, ranging from general to specific and  simple to complex topics. These sites therefore not only throw  open unbounded topics in the form of questions and answers, but  are especially attractive for open-ended problem discussions. In  online open corpus discussion forums, the scale and types of posts  are often very diverse in terms of user background, coverage of  topics, post volumes, post-response turnaround rates, etc. In  addition, these platforms are usually not moderated or guided by  teachers or teaching assistants, but are essentially governed by the  community. There has been considerable research on strategies to  filter the quality of content and encourage participation of online  communities via crowdsourcing, rating, tagging, badges, etc.  (Hsiao & Brusilovsky, 2011; Jeon, Croft, & Lee, 2005; Kittur,  Chi, & Suh, 2008; Snow, O'Connor, Jurafsky, & Ng, 2008). Such  social mechanisms tend to filter and point out the most possible  correct solutions. However, in the context of online learning, the  correct solutions may not necessarily be the best next steps for all  learners (Graesser, VanLehn, Rose, Jordan, & Harter, 2001; van  de Sande & Leinhard, 2007). Without personalized learning  support, the voted best solutions can be easily too sophisticated or  overly generic. With rapid growth in content and communities,  therefore, comes the need for more personalized and intelligent  support.    Currently, most forums or discussion boards lack dynamic and  extensive content analysis, mainly due to the discussion content is  often open-ended and filled with nebulous semantic structures. It  is so-called ill-defined problems, which have usually been within  the reach of qualitative human-coded methods, and are typically  difficult to scale. Moreover, these methods are challenging to  keep persistent traces for estimating students current knowledge  (Blikstein, 2011). Due to the increasing volume and run-time  calculation complexities (i.e. exhaustive linguistic features in  natural languages), most of the discourse-centric in-depth analyses  were performed offline and the lesson learned could only be  applied in the next iteration of system development or suffering  from shallow analytics (i.e. participation & contribution).  Recently, however, we have begun to see some studies that focus  on dynamic support for users, such as Cohere  structured online  discourse and summary (Buckingham Shum, 2008); Social  learning analytics (Buckingham Shum & Ferguson, 2012);  Asynchronous conversation analytics (Hoque, Carenini, & Joty,  2014). Yet, there has been no conclusive or comprehensive  technological support as well as systematic studies to date on  large-scale discussion forums. In addressing the research issues  discussed above, this paper focuses on studying viable algorithmic  technologies that support large-scale discussion forums  dynamically, specifically targeted at programming discussion  forums. We propose a novel Topic Facet Model (TFM) to extract  forum posts semantics for uncovering the latent structural topics.  We further prototype a visual analytics interface to present online   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

We assume users arrive at a  programming discussions site to seek help or to offer help, but not  all of them are domain experts. Therefore, we hypothesize that an  intelligent support through analytics on open online discussion  forums can help users examine the post content by viewing the  summarized topic facets.  The rest of the paper is structured as following: in section 2, we  review a series of related work regarding to discourse-centric  learning analytics and topic modeling.  In section 3 & 4, we  describe the novel generative Topic Facet Model and illustrate a  learning analytic prototype. Lastly, we discuss data collection and  evaluation results.   2. LITERATURE REVIEW  In order to address learner-centered technology for large-scale  online learning, Learning Analytics (Siemens & Baker, 2012) has  demonstrated promising results, especially in interdisciplinary  convergence. For example, the Signals project at Purdue  University is one of the pioneering examples of the successful  application of academic analytics that integrate predictive  modeling and report significantly higher grades and retention rates  than were observed in control groups (Arnold, 2010).  Nonetheless, the majority of learning analytics discuss visual  representations or the systems usefulness while the core should  be focused on real impact to improve learning or teaching  (Verbert, Duval, Klerkx, Govaerts, & Santos, 2013).    Over the decades, discourse analysis on discussion forums has  been carried out through various formats, network analyses,  topical analyses, interactive explorers, knowledge extraction, etc.  (Dave, Wattenberg, & Muller, 2004; Gretarsson et al., 2012;  Indratmo, Vassileva, & Gutwin, 2008; Lee, Kim, Cho, & Woo,  2013; Wei et al., 2010). With the rapid growth of free, open, and  large user-based online discussion forums, it is essential,  therefore, for education researchers to pay more attention to  emerging technologies that facilitate learning in cyberspace. For  instance, (Sande, 2010) investigated online tutoring forums for  homework help, making observations on the participation patterns  and the pedagogical quality of the content. (Hanrahan,  Convertino, & Nelson, 2012; Posnett, Warburg, Devanbu, &  Filkov, 2012) studied expertise modeling in such environment.  Cohere (Shum, 2008) investigates semantic connections by  identifying the link types to associate negative, positive, neutral  interactions among online discourses. (Wise, Zhao, &  Hausknecht, 2013) observed the listening behavior, which  encapsulates different actions that learners take in relation to  others posts (attending, reading etc.), to further describe the  discussion engagement.    Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003) is  an unsupervised algorithm that uses bag of words approach to  perform statistical topic modeling, which is a well-established  method for uncovering hidden structures in large text corpora.  There are several variations of LDA-based topic models that  successfully encapsulate large text semantics into topic words,  such as online reviews, political opinions, microblog streams,  email summaries etc. (Jo & Oh, 2011; Lan, Buntine, & Huidong,  2010; Liu et al., 2012; Wang, Agichtein, & Benzi, 2012). In this  work, we present a novel Topical Facets Modeling method to  capture online forum posts semantics.   3. TOPIC FACET MODEL   In order to automatically detect topics from conversational and  relatively short amount of texts in each forum post, we propose a   probabilistic topic model, Topic Facet Model, extending from  LDA (Blei et al., 2003). A topic is a multinomial distribution of  words that represents a concept from each forum post. A facet is a  multinomial distribution of words that represents a more specific  topic in the forum, for instance, extends (a java keyword) is one of  the main facets in determining whether a program implemented  inheritance concept in Java programming language or not. Thus,  Topic Facet Model firstly adopts SLDA (Lan et al., 2010) in the  topic model. Essentially, SLDA takes into account the position of  each individual word of topic inference. It then forces all words in  a sentence are generated from one topic. When a post is topic- specific, short-and-sweet, such as how to write a for loop,  SLDA is supposed to distinctively generate the corresponding  topic word - loops. However, as we discussed earlier, open  discussion forums are often mixed with various complexities of  posts. For instance, Can an array of objects be iterated in  enhanced for loop Given the sentence combines two main  concepts, arrays and loops, SLDA will constrain only one topic  word to be generated. In this case, the key of the question is about  topic arrays (whether one can perform a function with array data  structure), however, due to more topic loops-related words  represented, the SLDA will misinterpret it. This is where the  facets come into play, to take into account specificity of a topic in  the model. Following the same example, we can specify array  iteration as a facet for topic loops. To explain Topic Facet  Model algorithmically, Figure 1 shows the plate diagram. The  words generative process is explained following.      Figure 1. Topic Facet Model    1. For every pair of topic word t and facet f, draw a word  distribution ft ~ Dirichlet (f)   2. For each document d,  a. Draw the documents topic word distribution d ~   Dirichlet ()  b. For each topic word t, draw a facet distribution df ~   Dirichlet ()  c. For each sentence,    Choose a topic word j ~ Multinomial (d)   Given topic word j, choose a facet k ~ Multinomial   (dj)   Generate words w ~ Multinomial (jk)   Topic Facet Model exploits prior topic-keyword information by  using asymmetric . For example, we expect superclass,  subclass, inheritance are not probable in questions and answers  on topic loops and similarly the words for, dowhile, loops are  not synonymous to inheritance. This can be encoded into  such  that elements of  corresponding to one topic-keyword have small  values for the other topic-keywords. The latent variables ,  and   are inferred as Gibbs sampling as in original topic model (Blei                                       w         T N M D   F   f t             F   232    et al., 2003). At each transition step of the Markov chain, the topic  keyword and facet of the ith sentence are chosen according to the  conditional probability. The notations are described in Table 1.       The approximate probability of keyword j in post d is      The approximate probability of facet k for topic-keyword j in post  d is     The approximate probability of word w in topic-keyword facet {k,  j} is   Table 1.

VISUAL ANALYTICS PROTOTYPE  In order to provide dynamic intelligent support for large-scale of  online discussion forums, we build a Shiny web application by  using statistical computing language, R. The web application  (Figure 2) re-structures a discussion forum site into 3 parts:   Filters, Analytics Visualizations and Forum Posts. They are  represented in the following three UI panels from left to right:    1) Control panel (Left): data selection filters, such as post time  range, post types (questions, accepted, non- accepted, all)  etc. It also contains several semantic filters, such as topic  models.   2) Analytics panel (Middle):    a summative forum post scatter plot (top): by configuring the   x & y axes, it not only can provide the post density of entire  discussion site over time, but also can indicate topic  evolution.    topic facet model bubble chart (center): each bubble shows a  facet associated with a topic, and the size of the bubble  indicating the probability. For example, on selecting a post as  Figure 2 shows, a set of corresponding topic words that  represent Topic 2, where inner facet particularly stands out to  demonstrate the specificity.     learner-topic relation Sankey diagram (bottom): the user and  topic relation diagram is purposefully designed to connect  semantics and the communities, which can be implemented  in social network visualization as well.    3) Forum posts panel (Right):  discussion posts for mutual  referencing content and analytics.     Figure 2. Visual Analytics Prototype in Shiny, R   233    5. EVALUATION  5.1 Data Collection  We sampled one year (year 2013) of forum posts in topic Java  from stackoverflow site through StackExchange API. The data  pool was selected from the top 10 frequent tagged questions,  which also contained at least one accepted answer. It will allow us  to build a baseline on judging the topic facet model quality by  comparing to non-accepted answers. There are total 16,739 posts,  including 3,725 questions, 13,014 answers, with 3,718 accepted  answers.    5.2 Automatic Forum Posts Topic Generation  Since the statistical language model only estimates the probability  of words for natural languages, so we firstly parsed out all the  program codes from forum posts. We then generate forum posts  topics based on the Topic Facet Model. The topic generate  process is reported in Figure 3. We found that accepted answers  had significantly higher topic coverage than non-accepted answers  (Mann-Whitney U(98)=606, Z=4.4362, p<.01), where the topic  coverage was computed by entropy. An example from the data set  in the topic inheritance, where accepted answers topic facets  covered a broader range of relevant concepts (privat, subclass,  superclass, inherit, protect, public, class, object  inheritance),  but none-accepted answers only covered a minimum subset of the  topics (inherit, class, object, extend, subclass, super   inheritance). Note: we employed the state of the art Shannon  entropy measure among several diversity measures considering a  discussion post can cover a maximum unlimited number of topics.                            Figure 3. Topic generation process   5.3 Topic-Facet Discovery  In order to capture the specificity from forum posts, we model  content topics and the associated facets. To prove that topic  modeling can be applied for conversational and relative short  sentences in forum posts, we compare the performance of TFM  model with generic LDA. Table 2 demonstrates the discovered  facets regarding to topic inheritance, where LDA was performed   by MALLET1 toolkit with default =30/N, =0.01. We can see  that LDA seemed to generate a set of more sensible terms, but  only a few of them are truly related to inheritance. On the other  hand, TFM discovered the specificity from forum posts and  uncovered the topic related facets.    Table 2. Discovered facets regarding to topic inheritance  TFM: {class, inherit, if, xmlhttprequest, object, will, version, with, alwai,  discrimin, cat, can, code, public, privat, gener, often, recommend, must,  compon, protect, check persist, join, subclass, superclass, ar, or, contain,  prefer}   LDA: {gener, relation, base, semantic, implicit, kill, standard, signature,  fine, superclass, surface, type, book, bound, break, build, trick, total,  child, compile, trasnalte, mixin, hotswap, violate, pedantic, section, quote,  break, view, perimeters}   6. DISCUSSIONS AND LIMITATIONS  In this paper, we presented Topic Facet Model to extract topic  specificity from conversational and relatively short texts from  online programming discussion forums. We also presented a  functional prototype of visual analytics for discourse-centric  content. Our preliminary results demonstrated that TFM could be  a promising approach to automatically generate discourse  semantics for large-scale dynamic discussions. There are several  limitations for current implementation. 1) We recognize that  programming discussion forums are places for users to solve or to  search for code solutions. It is also essential to include a code  parser, to verify the solution quality as well as extract concepts  from the codes. However, we argue that for a programming  discussion forum, a natural language semantic parser and a  program code parser can coexist and compliment each other. In  the future study, we will consider both semantic parsers. 2) More  exhaustive evaluation: The visual analytics is currently a proof of  concept. More rigorous user study to examine the effects of auto- extracted semantic analytics on users is required. In addition, we  did not discuss the topic facet model performance issues in this  paper, however, when the topic numbers grow larger, it can be a  serious factor for dynamic online support.    7.
