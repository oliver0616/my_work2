The commissioned grants run from  February 2014 to June 2015. Preliminary results will be  available for LAK 15.    General Terms  Management, Human Factors.

LEARNING ANALYTICS AS AN  INSTITUTIONAL DECISION-MAKING  ISSUE  While learning analytics is often touted as a game  changer for higher education [4] there remains  considerable doubt about how the field will develop and  so what steps universities should take to adopt data-driven  practices to improving student engagement, success and  retention. While the majority of developments in the field  have so far focused on addressing students at-risk of  failure or drop-out [5] there is considerable interest in  how data can be marshaled to improve learning and  curriculum and progressively evolve to supporting  personalised learning within mass higher education [e.g.  2].    Given the rapid emergence of the field and a  commensurate increase in budgetary constraints there has   been no shortage of advice on what an institution should  do [e.g. 3]. However, these tracts offer vey abstract and  normative descriptions and there is little sense of how an  institution can move from an early stage of digital  awareness to a more rigorous data driven culture. The aim  of the two OLT commissioned projects outlined in this  poster is to develop a detailed guide that will allow  institutions to see where they sit within the likely  potential(s) of the field and what their current choices  imply for their future capabilities (e.g. when or whether to  consider open source options, finding the appropriate role  for vendors, comparing methods for making data  accessible, considering the tradeoff between internal skills  development and outsourcing etc.).  .   2. THE PROJECT  Key research aims include the comprehension of the  current state of learning analytics in Australian higher  education and the development of a roadmap, maturity  model or similar to guide the uptake of learning analytics  tools and practices. The project was undertaken by two  separate but complementary project teams, one led by the  University of South Australia (UniSA) (partner  institutions: University of Technology Sydney (UTS)  University of Melbourne (Melb), University of the  Sunshine Coast (USC), Macquarie University (Macq),  University of New England (UNE)); the other by Charles  Darwin University (CDU) (partner institutions: Griffith  University (Griff), Batchelor Institute of Indigenous  Tertiary Education (Batchelor), Murdoch University  (Murdoch), University of Newcastle (UoN)).     The projects gleaned primary data from institutions and  key experts about their perceptions regarding learning  analytics, its potential for the higher education sector, and  possible affordances and constraints.

The participants were drawn  from a range of backgrounds: research, practitioner, senior  manager, vendor and not-for-profit advocacy  organisations. The group concept mapping process[1] is a  blend of qualitative and quantitative approaches  incorporating brainstorming, sorting of ideas,  multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis.     2.3 Surveys  Two surveys designed to capture current practices and  levels of awareness of learning analytics within Australian  universities at an institutional (n  (n     These multiple sources of data will allow a granular and  multidimensional insight into current and future  operationalisations and conceptualisations of learning  analytics:     Bringing together the perspectives of vendors,  researchers and practitioners will allow the  triangulation of their insights.     The temporal, processual dimensions of the  research (i.e. the future scoping in the group  concept mapping) will allow the actual and  planned practices of today to be critiqued via the  possibilities inherent in the future.    The co-participation of researchers and  practitioners will yield insight into how the  research agenda can better inform higher  education practice.     3.
