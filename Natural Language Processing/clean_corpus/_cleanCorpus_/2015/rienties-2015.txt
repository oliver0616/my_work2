Learning design establishes the objectives and   pedagogical plans which can be evaluated against the outcomes   captured through learning analytics. However, no empirical study   is available linking learning designs of a substantial number of   courses with usage of Learning Management Systems (LMS) and   learning performance. Using cluster- and correlation analyses, in   this study we compared how 87 modules were designed, and how   this impacted (static and dynamic) LMS behavior and learning   performance. Our findings indicate that academics seem to design   modules with an invisible blueprint in their mind. Our cluster   analyses yielded four distinctive learning design patterns:   constructivist, assessment-driven, balanced-variety and social   constructivist modules. More importantly, learning design   activities strongly influenced how students were engaging online.   Finally, learning design activities seem to have an impact on   learning performance, in particular when modules rely on   assimilative activities. Our findings indicate that learning   analytics researchers need to be aware of the impact of learning   design on LMS data over time, and subsequent academic   performance.

INTRODUCTION  Learning analytics provide institutions with opportunities to   support student progression and to enable personalized, rich   learning [1-3]. With the increased availability of large datasets,   powerful analytics engines [2], and skillfully designed   visualizations of analytics results [4], institutions may be able to   draw on past experience to create supportive, insightful models of   primary (and perhaps real-time) learning processes [5].       While substantial progress has been made in terms of predictive   modeling in the Learning Analytics Knowledge (LAK)   community over the last three to four years [2], one element that   seems to be ignored is learning design.    Conole [6, p121] describes learning design as a methodology for   enabling teachers/designers to make more informed decisions in   how they go about designing learning activities and interventions,   which is pedagogically informed and makes effective use of   appropriate resources and technologies. Learning design is   widely studied in the Higher Education sector, but no study has   yet empirically connected learning designs of a substantial   number of courses with learning behavior in Learning   Management Systems (LMSs) and learning performance. This   study will begin to overcome this gap in learning analytics   research by combining three different sources of data (i.e., data   pertaining to learning design, LMS, and learning performance)   from 40 blended and online modules involving a total of 21,803   learners. In so doing, it will enable LAK researchers to better   understand which learning design elements may be important for   enhancing learning processes and performance.   1.1 Learning design taxonomy  The learning design taxonomy used for this process was   developed as a result of the Jisc-sponsored Open University   Learning Design Initiative (OULDI) [7], and was developed over   five years in consultation with eight Higher Education institutions.   Learning design as described by Conole [6] is process based:   practitioners make informed design decisions with a pedagogical   focus and communicate these to their colleagues and learners.   This is especially relevant for institutions which deliver distance   learning, such as the Open University UK (OU). At the OU,   modules are designed by teams of academics based in a central   location, but delivered to learners by different tutors in a wide   range of locations.    Table 1 shows the learning design taxonomy, which identifies   seven types of learning activity. Assimilative activities relate to   tasks in which learners attend to discipline specific information.   These include reading text (online or offline), watching videos, or   listening to an audio file. By finding and handling information, for   example on the internet or in a spreadsheet, learners take   responsibility for extending their learning, and are therefore   engaged in active learning [8]. Communicative activities refer to   any activities in which students communicate with another person   about module content. Productive activities draw upon   constructionist models of learning, whereby recent research has   indicated that learners who build [9] and co-construct new   artefacts learn effectively [10]. Experimental activities develop   students' intrinsic motivation and industry-relevant skill transfer  [11, p211] by providing learners with the opportunity to apply   their learning in a real life setting. Interactive activities endeavor   to do the same, but in some fields this is not possible: for   example, in medicine, such activities would have health and   Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for   personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that   copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

In these situations, a simulated environment might   be appropriate so that learners can apply their learning to a   realistic setting [12]. Finally, assessment activities encompass all   learning materials focused on assessment, whether enabling   teaching staff to monitor progress (formative); traditional   assessment for measurement purposes [13, p182] (summative); or   activities that allow learners to benchmark against their own or   fellow learners performance (ipsative).

Method   2.1 Setting  This study took place at the OU, the largest higher education   provider of online distance education in Europe. A process of   module mapping (i.e. analyzing and providing visualizations of   the learning activities and resources involved in a module) was   introduced as part of a university-wide learning initiative [14]   which aims to use learning design data for quality enhancement.   The mapping process is an intensive one, typically taking between   one and three days for a single module, depending on the   modules number of credits, structure, and quantity of learning   resources. A team of learning design specialists reviewed all the   available learning materials, classifies the types of activity, and   quantifies the time that students are expected to spend on each   activity.    Classifying learner activity can be subjective, and consistency is   important when using the data to compare module designs across   the univeristy. Therefore, the learning design team held regular   meetings to improve consistency across team members in the   mapping process. Once the mapping process was complete, the   learning design team manager reviewed the module before the   findings were sent to the faculty. Academics had the opportunity   to comment on the data before the status of the design was   finalised. In other words, each mapping was at least reviewed by   three people, which enhanced the reliability and robustness of the   data relating to each learning design.   2.2 Instruments   2.2.1 Learning Design mapping  The learning design tool at the Open Universtiy is a combination   of graphical, text-based tools that are used in conjunction with   learning design activities, which were mandated at particular   times in the design process. In total 87 modules were mapped by   the learning design team in the period January-August 2014. For   each module, the learning outcomes specified by the module team   (pertaining to knowledge and understanding; cognitive skills; key   skills; practical and/of professional skills) were captured by the   learning design specialist. Each activity within the modules   weeks, topics, or blocks was categorised according to the learning   design taxonomy (see Table 1). These categorisations were   captured in an activity planner (or blueprint).    2.2.2 LMS Data  In line with Tempelaar et al. [3], two different types of LMS data   in Moodle were gathered per module in a static and dynamic   manner: total number of visits to the LMS; and average time spent   on LMS. Subsequent derivatives of these two types of data per   week were recorded for week -2 until week 40 (data streams starts   two weeks before the actual start of the module). Although more   fine-grained learning analytics tracking data were available on   types of content, materials and ICT tools (e.g., wikis,   videoconference, discussion forums), given the diversity in usage   and the fact that not all modules used all the ICT tools we   measured, we focused on aggregate user statistics per week across   the LMS., Such data was available for 32 modules at the time this   study was conducted.    2.2.3 Learning performance  Learning performance was calculated by the number of learners   who completed and passed the module relative to the number of   learners who registered for each module. The academic retention   ranged between 28.57% and 100%. These figures do need to be   read in the context of the OUs mission to provide education for   all, regardless of entrance requirements [15].    2.2.4 Data analysis  As a first step, we analyzed the underlying structures and   collective patterns of the seven learning design activities by using   cluster analysis of the 87 modules. In line with the   recommendations of Hair, Tatham, Anderson and Black [16], we   conducted three different types of cluster analyses (K-means,   hierarchical ward, hierarchical furthest distance). Given that the   results were similar in terms of assigned clusters, in the results   section we will report cluster results using K-means analysis, as   this method is most commonly used. We then tested solutions for   2-5 clusters using K-means cluster analyses. The results seemed to   indicate that four clusters fitted the data best (at 5 clusters, too few   meaningful clusters were left). We labelled the clusters using   theoretical concepts [6, 7, 17-19] and in-depth experience of   learning design team.   As a second step, we merged the learning design data with the   LMS and learner retention data based upon module ID and year of   implementation. A mix of 15, 30 and 60 credit modules was   present. 32 modules could be linked with LMS learning behavior,   and 40 with learning performance data. Such data were not yet   available for 23 running modules, as these are currently being   undertaken by learners, while 8 modules (primarily MOOCs)   were not included in standard OU registration processes. For 8   modules the LMS data was not released yet. Finally, 16 module   learning designs referred to future designs for the academic year   316    2015-2016. Follow-up ANOVA and correlation analyses were   conducted using SPSS 21.    3. Results   3.1 Cluster analysis of learning designs  We conducted a K-means cluster analysis to identify common   patterns in how the 87 module teams designed and balanced the   seven learning design activities.       Figure 1 Cluster analysis of learning design   As illustrated in Figure 1, Cluster 1 modules seemed to have a   strong emphasis on assimilative activities, as 58% (SD = 11%) of   learning activities fell into this category, Students undertook   assimilative activities such as reading module materials, watching   videos and YouTube materials, reviewing core concepts and   approaches. In comparison to other modules, Cluster 1 modules   had a lower focus on the other six learning design activities. 24   (28%) modules were assigned to Cluster 1, which we label as   constructivist modules. For example, a first-year science   introductory module focused on understanding principles and   concepts in a range of topics, with several online assessments to   test (individual) learners understanding. Please note that not all   modules in Cluster 1 fit this description, but in comparison to   other clusters modules in Cluster 1 tended to have a relatively   stronger focus on cognition and understanding (in terms of the   taxonomy proposed by [20]). 22 (25%) modules were positioned   in Cluster 2, with a strong focus on assessment (M = 44.54, SD =   12.05), such as formative assessment for learning (e.g. write,   present, report, demonstrate) and summative assessment of   learning [3, 21]. In comparison to other modules, those in Cluster   2 had a relatively limited focus on assimilative, communication,   and interactive learning design activities. For example, an   introductory history course focused on providing a historical   perspective of a particular region in the UK, whereby a range of   assessment tasks were provided focused on culture, society and   nationhood. We label Cluster 2 as assessment-driven.   The 24 (28%) modules in Cluster 3 had a more or less equal   balance between assimilative and assessment learning design   activities, with a relatively high focus on experiential activities.   For example, the health and social care module used a mix of   understanding basic concepts as well as applying these concepts   using case-studies, self-reflections and collaborative approaches.   Therefore, we label Cluster 3 modules as balanced-variety,   whereby a range of different activities were expected from   learners.    Finally, the 16 (18%) modules in Cluster 4 seemed to use more a   learner-centered learning design approach, whereby relatively   more time was devoted towards communication, productive and   interactive activities. For example, in a foreign language module,   a range cognitive, skills-based, reflective and application tasks are   assessed using a mix of technology tools and blended tuition.   Therefore, we label these Cluster 4 modules as social   constructivist.   3.2 Linking learning design activities  Separate Pearson correlation analyses between the seven learning   design activities, total workload, and level of study indicated that   several groups of learning design activities were interrelated.   Workload is the number of hours that students objectively spend   on studying [22, p684]. In this study, workload was calculated by   the learning design team as part of the module mapping process.   Workload has been recognized as a major factor in the teaching   and learning environment[22, p684] and is of particular   importance at the OU.    We found that assimilative activities were negatively related to all   of the other six learning design activities, indicating that focusing   more on cognition and content reduces the focus on other   activities. No other statistically significant correlations were   found. Similar to assimilative activities, assessment was   negatively related to five of six learning design activities, which   may indicate that module teams implicitly or explicitly make a   trade-off between these learning design activities. Total workload   was not significantly related to any of the learning design   activities, indicating that teachers did not reserve any specific   extra time for a particular learning activity. Finally, the level of   the module (year 1, 2, 3, post-graduate) was positively correlated   with communication and total workload. Using ANOVA, no   significant differences were found with respect to disciplines. In   other words, most disciplines used a range of learning design   approaches, which seems contrast with previous findings of   studies [23] highlighting that disciplinary context strongly   influences the learning design.    3.3 Relating learning design with LMS  behavior  We linked the learning designs of 32 modules followed by 19,322   learners with their LMS data. On a total of 2,186,246 occasions,   the LMS was visited by 19,322 students. On average, students   spent 122.71 minutes per week (SD=92.47, range 14.39-167.94)   online during each of the first 10 weeks of the module. This wide   range highlights strong underlying differences in the way modules   were designed. Some modules primarily relied on traditional   methods of distance learning and course delivery via books and   readers, with limited interactions in the LMS [24]. Other modules   provided most or all of their course materials, tasks and learning   activities exclusively online and expected students to engage   actively in the LMS during the week. As a result, LMS activity   should only be regarded as a proxy for student engagement in   formal online activities, as at this point in time the OU does not   systematically collect data about formal or informal offline   activities.   We visually analyzed whether the four clusters lead to different   LMS usage over time. As illustrated in Figure 2, in particular in   the first ten weeks significant differences (using ANOVAs, not   illustrated) are present in terms of average time spent per week   between Cluster 4 social constructivist modules and the other   modules. Please note that for Cluster 3 LMS data for was only   available for one module.    317       Figure 2 Average LMS usage across four clusters   LMS visits were positively related to communication activities   and total (planned) workload, and negatively related to assessment   activities. Average time spent in the LMS correlated positively   with finding and handling information activities, communication   activities, and total workload, whilst, again, a negative relation   was found with assessment activities. Finally, if we split the   average time spent in the LMS for week -2 till week 10, only   communicative activities at week 0 and workload were   significantly correlated. Average time spent during weeks 1-10   were strongly related to modules with substantial learning   activities in terms of finding and handling information, and   communication. In other words, the learning design decisions of   teachers seemed to strongly influence how students were engaging   with the LMS, in particular when more inquiry- or social   constructivist learning activities were included in the learning   design.   3.4 Relating learning design with  learning performance  As a final step, we linked the learning design metrics with   learning performance, as illustrated in Table 2. The only   significant (negative) correlations between the seven learning   design activities and learning performance were with assimilative   activities. Modules with a relatively high proportion of   assimilative learning activities had significantly lower completion   and pass rates than other modules. Furthermore, positive   correlations were found between productive and assessment   activities and pass rates, although these were not   statistically significant.      Table 2 Linking learning design with learning performance      No significant correlations were found between our LMS   indicators and learning performance (not illustrated). Follow-up   ANOVA analyses indicated no significant differences in learning   performance between the four clusters. In other words, although   there are substantial variations in the 40 module designs, our   findings indicated that applying one of the four design templates   did not necessarily disadvantage learners in terms of retention.   However, extensive reliance on assimilative activities did seem to   have a negative influence on learning performance, although   given the relatively small number of modules within the sample   we caution readers against overgeneralization.   4. Discussion  Pedagogy and learning design have played a key role in computer-  assisted learning in the last two decades [6, 19, 25], but research   has not extensively linked learning design to learning behavior   and learner performance [23, 26]. Progress has recently been   made in how (combinations of) individual learning design   elements (e.g., task design, feedback, scaffolding, structure)   influence learning processes and success in experimental and   natural settings within single modules. However, this study was   the first to link a large range of learning designs from multiple   blended and online modules with learning behavior in a Learning   Management System (LMS) and learning performance data.    The studys first important finding is that academics seem to   design modules with an invisible blueprint in their mind. Our   cluster analyses yielded four distinctive learning design patterns   as shown in Figure 2, namely constructivist, assessment-driven,   balanced-variety, and social constructivist modules. This means   that whilst the learning design process intends to stimulate   creativity, upon analysis these unique designs neatly fitted into   four broad theoretical perspectives. This finding suggests that   although creativity is still present in the process (as none of the   designs are identical), academic staff do employ similar   combinations of pedagogical underpinnings into their learning   designs [23, 26].    Our second and perhaps most important finding is that learning   design and learning design activities in particular strongly   influence how students are engaging in our LMS. Particularly in   social constructivist environments, students actively engage with   the LMS, while in constructivist and assessment-based modules,   online activity seems substantially lower. While a vast body of   research in computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL)   [25] has found that learning design influences how people learn,   in learning analytics research learning design seems to be mostly   ignored, or overlooked. Without mapping and linking the planned   learning design activities (e.g., assessments, interactive, or   communication activities) with LMS usage, learning analytics   researchers might find it difficult to explain why certain peaks and   troughs occur over time.    Our third finding is that learning design seems to have an impact   on learning performance. In particular, modules with a heavy   reliance on content and cognition (assimilative activities) seemed   to lead to lower completion and pass rates. The availability of   learning analytics data means that management and course teams   often review courses whilst they are still in progress. If this data   suggests that learners do not perform according to the initial   learning design, it is tempting to take action. Often this includes   providing additional material to learners in the form of reading   lists or additional handouts. As this study found that modules with   a strong reliance on assimilative activities did seem to have a   negative influence on learning performance, it suggests that such   interventions might make matters worse.   5. Conclusions and future work  A substantial limitation of this study is the relatively small linked   sample size. Although the OU learning design team mapped a   substantial amount of 87 modules, only 32 modules containing   LMS data and 40 modules containing learning performance data   could currently be linked due to module completion timescales.   As a result, more advanced regression or structural equation   modeling were not feasible to determine the direct and indirect   relations in our three datasets. In the near future, we would be able   to extend the sample when more data becomes available in order   -400600  -2 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 cluster 1 constructivist  cluster 2 assessment driven  cluster 3 balanced-variety  318    to better understand the complex (inter)relations of learning   design on learning processes and outcomes.    Combining this analysis with the learning outcomes data allows   sharing of good practice based upon robust analysis.   Furthermore, a particularly useful feature would be to integrate   this with demographic, individual and socio-cultural data about   students, which may influence whether a learning design is   suitable for a range of learners. In terms of practical implications   for LAK, researchers, teachers and policy makers need to be   aware of how learning design choices made by teachers influence   subsequent learning processes and learning performance over   time. Following Arbaugh [17], there is an urgent need for   researchers and managers to combine research data and   institutional data and work together in order to unpack how   context, learner characteristics, modular and institutional learning   design activities impact the learning journeys of our students.
