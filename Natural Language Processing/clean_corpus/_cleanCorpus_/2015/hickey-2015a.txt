Unlike traditional grades, certificates, and  transcripts, badges include specific claims about learning  accomplishments and detailed evidence in support of those  claims. Considering the richness of data associated with Open  Badges, it is reasonable to expect a very powerful predictive  element at the intersection of Open Badges and Learning  Analytics. This could have substantial implications for  recommending and exposing students to a variety of curricular  and co-curricular pathways utilizing data sources far more  nuanced than grades and achievement tests. Therefore, this  workshop was aimed at: i) examining the potentials of Open  Badges (including the associated data and resources) to provide  new and potentially unprecedented data for analysis; ii) examining  the kinds of Learning Analytics methods and techniques that  could be suitable for gaining valuable insights from and/or  making predictions based on the evidence (data and resources)  associated with badges, and iii) connecting Open Badges  communities, aiming to allow for the exchange of experiences and  learning from different cultures and communities.

Unlike traditional grades, certificates, and  transcripts, badges include specific claims about learning  accomplishments and detailed evidence in support of those  claims. A systematic examination of the adoption of Open Badges  in numerous educational settings by Indiana Universitys Design  Principles Documentation Project (http://dpdproject.info/)  revealed that the introduction of badges prompted useful  deliberations about (a) the learning to be recognized, (b) the  claims to be made about that learning, and (c) the assessment  needed to support those claims. Such deliberations tend to  enhance the validity of the evidence associated with a badge, thus  properly supporting the claims stated in the badge. Therefore, the  evidence contained in badges offers unprecedented opportunity  for analyzing learning. Furthermore, the thinking and negotiations  that go into deciding what claims and evidence to include in  digital badges often result in highly credible and valuable  information about the accomplished learning.   Considering the richness of data associated with Open Badges -  (meta)data stored in badges themselves, primarily requirements,  achievement evidence and timestamps, as well as data about  learning pathways followed by students (i.e., learning traces) - it  is reasonable to expect a very powerful predictive element at the  intersection of Open Badges and Learning Analytics. The data  associated with badges might offer highly valuable input not only  to predict what may be a good fit for the next learning activity, but  perhaps even what a learner is capable of in a certain timeframe.  This fertile ground could have substantial implications for  recommending and exposing students to a variety of curricular  and co-curricular pathways utilizing data sources far more  nuanced than grades and achievement tests.   Open Badges are rapidly gaining traction among educational  practitioners, education-oriented companies and non-profit  organizations. They have already been adopted by over 2000  organizations1, including well-known learning management  platforms such as Moodle, Blackboard and Canvas.

LAK '15, Mar 16-20, 2015, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA  ACM 978-1-4503-3417-4/15/03.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2723576.2723639    392    organizers are currently involved in efforts to track badges  functionality across these platforms, and introduce this  functionality into other platforms including Open edX and Google  Coursebuilder. The newly formed Badge Alliance  (http://www.badgealliance.org/) already includes 700 members  and a dozen working groups, and the Clinton Global Initiative  estimates that over 4M badges have been issued to date2. This  indicates the relevancy and potential that the concept and  technology of Open Badges could unlock for education domain in  general, and, for the above stated reasons, for Learning Analytics  field, in particular.   2. OBJECTIVES  The objectives of the workshop were threefold:    Examine the potentials of Open Badges (including the  associated data and resources) to provide new and potentially  unprecedented data for analysis.    Examine the kinds of Learning Analytics methods and  techniques that could be suitable for gaining valuable  insights from and/or make predictions based on the evidence  (data and resources) associated with badges.     Build a bridge across Open Badges communities, aiming to  allow for the exchange of experiences and learning from  different cultures and communities.   3. TOPICS  The workshop welcomed submissions on some of the topics from  the following (though not restrictive) list:    Challenges and opportunities related to the use of Learning  Analytic methods and techniques in the domain of Open  Badges.     Different kinds of feedback for teachers and/or students that  could be generated based on the data and resources  associated with badges.    Analysis and visualization of learners badge-earning  pathways as means of i) assisting badge issuers in improving  their instructional design, and ii) scaffolding learners  reflection over the learning process.    How different kinds of badges  e.g., participatory badges vs.  assessment-based badges  impact learners engagement in  disciplinary discourse    Intersection of Open Badges and the Open Analytics  initiative and other recent efforts to open and share analytics  data  how open access and visibility affect the functionality  of badges as a motivator of behaviour    Combined use of Open Badges Specification3 with other  education-oriented specifications and vocabularies (e.g.,  TinCan, LRMI), to allow for a greater insight into to  evidence associated with badges.    Using semantic technologies to i) analyze evidence contained  in digital badges, ii) allow for a comparison and alignment of  badges issued by different organizations, and iii) interpret the  meaning of a collection of heterogeneous badges  what do  they say about a learner and his/her competencies    Examining learning pathways that emerge in large scale  badging efforts like the seven-city Cities of Learning4 in  2014.                                                                        2 http://10mbetterfutures.org/  3 https://github.com/openbadges/openbadges-specification   4 http://goo.gl/YNKsU8    4. AUDIENCE  Open Badges connect educational providers and practitioners,  entrepreneurs, and researchers in discourses on teaching, learning,  assessment, digital credentials, and digital education in general.  While preserving its general focus on opportunities and challenges  associated with Open Badges, this 2nd installment of the OBIE  workshop was primarily intended for those interested in the  intersection of Open Badges and Learning Analytics. This  intersection includes gathering, integration, and analysis of data  and resources associated with Open Badges, with the ultimate aim  of providing teachers, learners and other stakeholders in the ever- increasing Open Badges ecosystem with informative and relevant  feedback, and predictive functions. Participants in the workshop  were exposed to presentations and discussions on the position and  role of digital badges in instructional design, on compelling data  and analytics challenges and opportunities that the Open Badges  infrastructures open for the Learning Analytics field, and on  different types and designs of badge systems and their potential to  impact the future of education.   5. PREVIOUS EDITION OF THE  WORKSHOP  This is the second edition of Open Badges in Education (OBIE)  workshop. The first edition (Open Badges in Education: Novel  Motivational, Scaffolding and Recognition Mechanism for Web- based Learning5) was held together with the 13th International  Conference on Web-based Learning (ICWL2014) in Tallinn,  Estonia, in August 2014. Even though the workshop was expected  to be a small event, it attracted over 30 people interested in badges  and related educational approaches and practices. During the  workshop, the participants engaged in lively discussions on many  important topics related to Open Badges, and to keep the  discussion live and to evolve a community around the concept and  technology of Open Badges, we set up OBIE Google Group6 as a  communication channel for the workshop participants and  contributors, as well as all researchers, educators, Open Badges  enthusiasts, and everyone interested in, willing to learn about,  and/or work/experiment with badges in educational settings. It  was this group that initially proposed and supported organization  of the 2nd OBIE workshop at LAK15.   6.
