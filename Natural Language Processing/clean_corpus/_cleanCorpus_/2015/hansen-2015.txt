Socioeconomic Status and MOOC Enrollment: Enriching  Demographic Information with External Datasets    John D. Hansen  Harvard University   john_hansen@mail.harvard.edu   Justin Reich  Harvard University   justin_reich@mail.harvard.edu     ABSTRACT  To minimize barriers to entry, massive open online course  (MOOC) providers collect minimal demographic  information about users. In isolation, these data are  insufficient to address important questions about  socioeconomic status (SES) and MOOC enrollment and  performance. We demonstrate the use of third-party  datasets to enrich demographic portraits of MOOC students  and answer fundamental questions about SES and MOOC  enrollment. We derive demographic information from  registrants geographic location by matching self-reported  mailing addresses with data available from Esri at the  census block group level and the American Community  Survey at the zip code level. We then use these data to  compare neighborhood income and parental education for  US registrants in HarvardX courses to the US population as  a whole. Overall, HarvardX registrants tend to reside in  more affluent neighborhoods.  Registrants on average live  in neighborhoods with median incomes approximately .45  standard deviations higher than the US population. Higher  levels of parental education are also associated with a  higher likelihood of registration.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT  Advocates for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)  have promoted their potential to make education class- blind  [1]  and allow people who lack access to world- class learningan opportunity to make a better life for  themselves and their families [6] . In ideal circumstances  for class-blind educational opportunities, we would hope  to see societys least affluent students equally or over- represented in the distribution of registrants. The earliest   evidence of MOOC enrollment, however, suggests that  most registrants already have a bachelors degree  [9, 12] ,  raising the question of whether MOOCs are reinforcing the  advantages of the haves rather than educating the have- nots [4] . Understanding patterns of MOOC enrollment  for students of different backgrounds is critical to  determining whether MOOCs are ameliorating or  exacerbating educational inequalities.    In order to understand and address educational inequalities,  MOOC researchers need detailed demographic information  about students. In particular, we are interested in  registrants socioeconomic status (SES), which is broadly  defined as ones access to financial, social, cultural, and  human capital resources [11] . A panel of experts  assembled by the National Center for Education Statistics  identifies a triad of measures that are most useful in  characterizing student SES: family income, parental  educational attainment, and parental occupational status.  This information is regularly available to higher education  researchers, as most college and financial aid applications  solicit information on parental educational attainment and  occupation, and on family income and assets.   These SES measures, however, are not available for MOOC  registrants. In an effort to maximize enrollment, MOOC  providers minimize barriers to entry and rely on brief,  voluntary surveys to gather demographic data. For instance,  to register with edX, individuals are only asked to provide  their gender, year of birth, level of education, and address.  Many courses also offer more detailed surveys for  registered students, but course faculty and MOOC providers  are rightly hesitant about soliciting personal information in  the early days of a course. Consequently, investigating the  impact of MOOCs on students from different backgrounds  requires creative approaches to leveraging available data.   In this paper, we show how third-party census datasets can  be used to enrich the limited SES data collected by a  MOOC platform in order to provide a richer understanding  of student background characteristics. First, we use self- reported student addresses to identify student  neighborhoods, and then use data about a neighborhoods  median household income as a measure of SES, as  discussed by the NCES panel  [11] . Previous research has  found that neighborhood affluence is related to college  attendance for adolescents [3] and educational attainment  for adults  [10] .

We demonstrate the importance of these data-analytic  strategies in an investigation of the relationship between  SES and registration in nine MOOCs offered by  HarvardXan initiative by Harvard University to offer  MOOCs through the edX platformin the 2013-2014  academic year. To better understand how access to  resources shapes MOOC enrollment, we offer comparisons  of HarvardX registrants and the US population with respect  to neighborhood affluence and parental educational  attainment. In doing so, we demonstrate the value of third- party datasets in estimating how new forms of online  learning impact access to educational opportunities.   2. DATASET  Our primary dataset of MOOC enrollees includes  registrants from nine HarvardX courses conducted during  the 2013-2014 school year on the edX platform. We include  all courses offered between September 2013 and June 2014  hosted on the edX platform that issued certificates to  students who earned a sufficiently high grade. If a course  was offered in a series of modules, we include only the first  module in the series. Including US users, non-US users, and  users whose country could not be identified, our dataset  contains 238,572 unique registrants. In this paper, we focus  on the US population, whom we identify through a  combination of self-reported country and IP geo-location.  We drop registrants reporting a country outside the US and  registrants reporting no country who were not geo-located  to the United States (145,858 in total). To avoid issues of  sparse data and possible misrepresentation of extremely  young or old ages, we drop 12,275 registrants reporting an  age younger than 13 or older than 69. This leaves us with  79,921 unique registrants from the US    In order to register for a HarvardX course on the edX  platform, users were invited to complete a site registration  on edX. This site registration includes a voluntary four- question survey asking for student gender, level of  education, year of birth, and mailing address. Address is  collected as a single open-response text field. 60,892  registrants or 76% completed the entire survey.    Upon enrolling in a HarvardX course, registrants were then  asked to complete a pre-course survey, but no mechanism  existed to enforce completion. Registrants were asked to  complete the survey through in-course prompts and emails,  but response rates were generally low as a proportion of all  registrants, ranging from 14% to 45%. This survey included  approximately 20 items, including a question asking  students to self report their mothers and fathers highest  level of education, and response rates to this item varied  from 13% to 34% across courses.   We use three additional sources of publicly available data  in our analyses. The first source contains data from the  American Community Survey (5-year estimates for 2008-  2012) organized at the zip code level and available for  download from the US Census Bureau website [14]. The  US Census Bureau delivers the American Community  Survey (ACS) each year to several million American  residents, and survey items include age, education, and  income. The second source, from the Minnesota Population  Centers IPUMS website, organizes the ACS 5-year  estimates at the person level  [13] . We use this dataset to  compare the US and HarvardX distributions of parental  education for adolescents. Lastly, we use Esris 2013  demographic dataset  [5],  which provides estimates for  median household income and age distributions within each  census block group.    3. DATA ANALYTIC STRATEGY  First, we demonstrate two ways of obtaining measures of  median neighborhood income for HarvardX students, using  only zip code and then using a full address. In subsequent  analyses, we use the full address because it allows us to  compare HarvardX registrants to similarly aged US  residents.  This is important because both neighborhood  income and educational attainment  [7]  are associated with  age, and the distribution of ages among US HarvardX  registrants differs from the US population [8] . Second, we  compare the distributions of parental education of  HarvardX registrants and US persons. Third, we append our  HarvardX dataset to the ACS and Esri datasets and fit  regression models to estimate the likelihood of a US  resident registering conditional on SES and age.   4. DERIVING NEIGHBORHOOD INCOME   We present two approaches to parsing mailing addresses  provided by HarvardX registrants and using this  information to obtain further information about median  neighborhood income. Our first approach was to parse self- reported mailing addresses from the edX site registration  form for a zip code and match it to demographic data  available at the zip code level from the American  Community Survey. The overall median zip code income  estimate for the US is $53,046  [15] . Since the ACS  includes the count of occupied housing units by zip code,  we computed the mean of median zip code household  income in the US by taking a weighted average. The  weighted mean of median zip code incomes in the US was  $56,532 (sd = 22,876). Estimates are in 2012 dollars. The  mean of median zip code household income observed in the  HarvardX sample of unique registrants was $68,262. The  difference between unique HarvardX registrants and the US  population is $11,730, or approximately .51 standard  deviations (11,730/22,876).   Our secondand preferredapproach was to derive  neighborhood income data using a demographic dataset  available from Esri. We parsed the mailing address from the  edX site registration survey into several fields, which  allowed geocoding software to estimate latitude and  longitude coordinates, and we performed a spatial join to  match HarvardX registrants with demographic data for their   60    census block group. In the Esri dataset, the geographic unit  of analysis is the census block group and population counts  are disaggregated by age  [5] , which allowed us to reshape  it such that each row corresponded to a frequency-weighted  age within a census block group.    Figure 1 shows that HarvardX registrants reporting a  parsable mailing address (n=44,362) tend to live in census  block groups with higher median household incomes than  individuals of the same age in the US. According to our  dataset, where 2013 census block group median income is  top-coded at $200,001, the weighted mean in the US is  $57,642 (sd = 30,535). For unique HarvardX registrants, the  comparable mean is $70,646. Notice that we find the  difference to be greater for younger and older students  compared to students between 20 and 40. Using the same  approach as we did with ACS zip code data, we compute a  difference in neighborhood income of $13,184, or .425  standard deviations. We can further refine these  comparisons by simultaneously taking into account the  differences in registration probability and neighborhood  median income attributable to age. To estimate the average  difference in neighborhood median household income  between HarvardX registrants and the US population taking  into account the cross-sectional association between age  and neighborhood income, we fit the following model:     _!" =  !" + ! + !",   where  is the average difference in neighborhood median  income between HarvardX registrants and members of the  US population of the same age. ! is the average difference  in neighborhood income attributable to age,  is a dummy  variable equal to 1 for HarvardX registrants (and 0  otherwise), and  is a random error term assumed to be  normally distributed with mean 0.  The coefficient of  interest, , can be thought of as the weighted average of  differences between each pair of dots and triangles in  Figure 3. Our estimate for  is $14,009 (p < .05), with a   95% confidence interval of 13,727 to 14,291. This is  approximately .46 standard deviations in terms of the  unconditional standard deviation (the standard deviation of  neighborhood income varies with age).   Taken together, these three methodsaverage difference in  median zip code income, average difference in median  census block income, and average difference in median  census block income controlling for agesuggest that  HarvardX registrants live in neighborhoods with median  incomes almost one-half of a standard deviation higher than  the general US public. Our estimates speak to the general  efficacy of deriving demographic data from self-reported  addresses, and this approach can easily be extended to  include other demographic data published at the  neighborhood level. Considering the interest in identity  verification in MOOCs, its plausible that address will  remain an accessible and useful SES measure for  researchers in the future, especially if trends in US  residential segregation by income  [17]  continue to rise.    5. PARENTAL EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT  To continue to develop our comparison of SES measures of  HarvardX registrants and the US population, we next  examine the distributions of parental educational  attainment. Here we focus primarily on the distribution of  adolescent registrants for HarvardX. Recall that we obtain  self-reported data of attainment levels from surveys  disseminated after course registration, and we can compare  these with US characteristics obtained from the American  Community Survey. We focus on adolescents in our  HarvardX/US comparisons for two reasons: first, this is an  age group where parental education is well-established as  an important measure of SES [11], and second, the  collection of ACS data on parental education becomes less  reliable for individuals older than seventeen, since it is  obtained from households where children live with their  parents  [14] . Following a common convention [11], we  define parental educational attainment as the highest degree  attained for ones most educated parent.

Adolescent  HarvardX registrants report higher levels of parental  educational attainment than typical adolescents in the US.  While the modal value for the US is high school  completion, the mode is a graduate degree for HarvardX  registrants.    6. HOW DOES SES PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD  OF MOOC REGISTRATION   In this section, we use logistic regression to analyze  registrant demographics. We do this by literally appending  the HarvardX dataset to either the ACS or Esri dataset.  The  ACS and Esri datasets are representative of the  approximately 232 million US residents aged 13-69, and  appending the HarvardX makes our dataset trivially less  representative. Since variables for the ACS and Esri dataset  focus on different units of observation (the person and the  census block group, respectively), we must evaluate median  income and parental education separately.    For parental education, we fit the following mode:   ( !" = 1   !")) = (!") + !,   where the coefficient of interest is , the within-age  difference in the log-odds of HarvardX registration  attributable to a difference in parental education. We use an  ordinal scale such that 1 = Less than HS completion, 2 =  HS completion, 3 = Associates degree, 4 = Bachelors  degree, and 5 = Graduate degree. (Additional analyses with  dummies for each level have similar results. [8] ) ! is a full  set of age dummy variables, accounting for the difference in  registration likelihood attributable to age. We estimate that,  on average, a one-unit increment on our parental education  scale is associated with a .85 increase in the log-odds of  registration. Therefore, we find that a one-unit change in  parental education is associated with an individual being  more than twice as likely to register (e.85 = 2.34).     Logistic regression models predicting HarvardX  registration using neighborhood median income, shown in  Table 1, also indicate that registrants on average tend to be  more socially advantaged than the US population. Unlike  our previous models, we dont exclude adult registrants.   Model 1 constrains the relationship between neighborhood  income and registration to be the same for all age groups. In  Model 2, we allow the relationship to vary across age  groups, which we define as: 13-17, 18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40- 49, 50-59 and 60-69. In terms of log-odds, we estimate:    ( !"# = 1   !"#)) = !(_!"#) + !(_!" _!"#) + !,   where ! is the difference in the log-odds of registration  attributable to neighborhood income for the baseline age  group (13-17), and ! is the differential association of  neighborhood income and registration compared to the  baseline group. ! is the difference in the log-odds      of registration attributable to age. For two seventeen year-  olds, a $1,000 increment in neighborhood median income is  associated with a .0135 increase in the log-odds of  registration. The mean of census block group median  income is the US is $57,600, and its standard deviation is  approximately $30,000. If seventeen year-olds were  uniformly distributed with respect to neighborhood median  income, we would estimate that more than twice as many  individuals residing in neighborhoods with medians of  $117,600 (two standard deviations above the mean) would  register compared to average neighborhoods.    6. DISCUSSION  If edX and other MOOC platforms promoted a set of truly  class-blind educational opportunities, we might expect at  least two things to be true of the registered students. First,  we would expect registrants for these courses to come from  a wide range of social backgrounds. Indeed, we do find that  the 2013-2014 HarvardX courses include American  students living in some the nations poorest neighborhoods  as well as the wealthiest neighborhoods, and include  students whose parents hold advanced degrees as well as  students whose parents have very little formal education.    We might also expect, however, that in a class-blind set of  educational opportunities, the distribution of registrants  would reflect the distribution of the larger population, and  in this dimension, the population of HarvardX registrants is   Table 1: Logistic regression models of HarvardX  registration likelihood by age and neighborhood income    (1) (2)   med_hinc Age Group   Interactions      med_hinc 0.0123*** 0.0135***   (0.000124) (0.000769)      13.17 * med_hinc  0    (.)      18.24 * med_hinc  -0.0000824    (0.000840)      25.29 * med_hinc  -0.00265**    (0.000845)      30.34 * med_hinc  -0.00266**    (0.000852)      35.39 * med_hinc  -0.00287***    (0.000869)      40.49 * med_hinc  -0.00191*    (0.000817)      50.59 * med_hinc  0.000287    (0.000820)      60.69 * med_hinc  0.00132    (0.000850)  Observations 232277133 232277133  neg2ll 829125.6 828981.4  r2_p 0.0228 0.0230  df_m 57 64  Standard errors in parentheses  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001  Coefficients for Age Dummy Variables Omitted   62    disappointing. US HarvardX registrants on average live in  neighborhoods with median incomes approximately .45  standard deviations higher than the US population. Parental  education is also associated with a higher likelihood of  MOOC enrollment. For instance, a seventeen year-old  whose most educated parent has a graduate degree is more  than twice as likely to register as one whose most educated  parent has a bachelors. Our findings suggest that MOOCs  disproportionately attract the socially advantaged.     This analysis only examines one facet of the complex  interplay between MOOCs, SES, and educational  inequality. The digital divide is best understood as two  divides, one of access and one of usage [2]. While we show  here that students from advantaged backgrounds are more  likely to enroll in MOOCs, this analysis does not shed light  on whether students from lower-income neighborhoods or  from families with lower levels of education attainment  have lower persistence, participation, or performance within  MOOCs. We are currently pursuing these analyses, which  are made possible by the more demographic portrait formed  by linking MOOC surveys with external sources of data.    One of the challenges of conducting studies on how  students from different background engage differently with  MOOCs is that the desire to keep MOOCs easily accessible  often precludes asking probing demographic questions as a  condition of entry into a course. For the foreseeable future,  we expect that conducting rich inquiries about student  background characteristics will require drawing on external  datasets, both to expand the information that we have about  each student and to better understand how MOOC students  compare to populations as a whole. While current terms of  service permit this research, MOOC students should be  informed of these analytic strategies. The contribution of  this paper is to demonstrate how external datasets can be  used to expand demographic pictures of learners and  provide a reference point of comparison between MOOC  students and larger populations.    8.
