Building on a series of activities  of the LinkedUp project, the challenge aims to generate new  insights and analysis on the LA & EDM disciplines and is  supported through the LAK Dataset - a unique corpus of LA &  EDM literature, exposed in structured and machine-readable  formats.

The available datasets can be  roughly distinguished between (a) tracking data that comes from  different learning environments [1] and (b) Linked data from the  web [2].   Tracking data from different learning environments involves  interactions of learners with different tools and resources. The  main driver for analyzing these data is the vision of increased   awareness of the learning progress, self-regulation support, and  personalized learning that offers potential to create more effective  learning experiences through new possibilities for the prediction  and reflection of individual learning processes. Most of the time  the tracking data underlies legal and privacy restrictions that make  it difficult to share the data or make it accessible to third parties.   Next to the large amount of tracking data, there is an increasing  amount of Linked Data on the Web that covers educational data  published by institutions about their courses and learning  resources. The Linked Data approach enables the enrichment of  learning content and the learning experience by making use of  various connected data sources. Through reusing schemas and  vocabularies as well as by relying on persistent URIs for data  referencing, a higher level of interoperability is being provided.  This makes it more convenient to use Linked Data for research  purposes and makes the outcomes of the research more  comparable.    The LinkedUp project has created a dataset catalogue1 of  educationally relevant (linked) datasets that is freely accessible  [4]. The main aim of LinkedUp was to identify and promote  innovative success stories that exploit Linked Data in educational  scenarios. Under this objective, it contributed a linked dataset for  the Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM)  communities to facilitate research, analysis, and smart explorative  applications to gain new insights into the research papers  published in this domain [5].   In 2014, the LinkedUp project2 organized the 2nd LAK Data  Challenge based on the LAK13 dataset [3]. A range of interesting  applications and analytical research has been contributed to the  previous challenges that provided new insights into the  development of the emerging research field3. The submissions  provide evidence for the main differences as well as the  relationships between the EDM and the LAK research  community. As the LinkedUp project has been successfully  completed in October 2014, we are glad to announce that the  LACE project4 was interested to host the LAK data challenge in  2015 in cooperation with SoLAR.                                                                         1http://data.linkededucation.org/ and   http://data.linkededucation.org/linkedup/catalog/   2 http://www.linkedup-project.eu   3 http://linkedu.eu/event/lak2013-linkeddata-tutorial/page_id=58  4 http://laceproject.eu    Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

LAK '15, Mar 16-20, 2015, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA  ACM 978-1-4503-3417-4/15/03.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2723576.2723641        396    The challenge submissions should exploit the extended LAK 2014  dataset for meaningful purposes. This includes submissions which  cover one or more of the following, non-exclusive list of topics.   - What are the main differences between the EDM and  LAK community over time   - What are new and emerging topics  - Do different visualisations of the data lead to different   insights   - How can the LAK dataset be used to point to related   research efforts in other scientific disciplines such as  educational science, ethics and legal aspects but also  new technologies    - Which of the articles in the data provide evidence for  positive or negative effects of learning analytics  research on the educational practices   2. The LAK Dataset   The LAK Dataset has been extracted to create a structured corpus  including full text, references, and metadata including authors,  affiliations, titles, keywords and abstracts. The schema used to  describe the papers in the dataset is based on two established  schemas: the Semantic Web Conference Ontology (already used  to describe metadata about publications from the Semantic Web  conferences and related events) and the Linked Education schema.  The data is accessible under http://lak.linkededucation.org.    Throughout the past year and following on the LAK Data  Challenge 2014, the dataset has been improved and expanded as a  joint effort by SoLAR, ITD-CNR5, and the LinkedUp project.  Latest publications from the LAK2014 and EDM2014  conferences were added, enriching content and keywords with  references to DBpedia and including the actual references of each  publication. The current version of the LAK datasets consists of:    Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on  Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) (2011-14)    Proceedings of the previous editions of the LAK Data  Challenge (2013-14)    Proceedings of the International Conference on Educational  Data Mining (2008-14)    The open access journal Educational Technology & Society  recently published a 2012 special issue on Learning and  Knowledge Analytics: Educational Technology & Society -  Special Issue on Learning & Knowledge Analytics.    Journal of Educational Data Mining (2009-14)   Journal of Learning Analytics (2014)   3. Workshop Organization  3.1 Workshop Facilitators   The workshop is organized jointly by SoLAR, the LACE project  and associated partner CNR-ITD. In addition the special interest  groups Linked Education (http://linkededucation.org) and SIG  dataTEL (http://ea-tel.eu/sig-datatel/) of EATEL will support the  competition. All partners aim at advancing data-driven research in  education. The main goals are to foster the cooperation between  different Learning Analytics research units and to offer reference  datasets for data-driven research.   The partners can look back on an annual workshop series at  different conferences, including:     Linked Learning 2014  4th International Workshop on                                                                        5 www.itd.cnr.it/     Learning and Education with the Web of Data (LILE2014) at  ISWC2014, Riva del Garda, Italy.
