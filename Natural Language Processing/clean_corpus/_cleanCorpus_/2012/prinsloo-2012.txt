To realise the potential of learning analytics to  impact on student retention and success, mega open distance  learning (ODL) institutions face a number of challenges,  paradoxes and opportunities.     For the purpose of this paper we critique a closed view of  learning analytics as focusing only on data produced by students  interactions with institutions of higher learning. Students are not  the only actors in their learning journeys and it would seem  crucial that learning analytics also includes the impacts of all  stakeholders on students learning journeys in order to increase  the success of students learning.  As such the notion of  Thirdspace as used by cultural, postmodern and identity  theorists provide a useful heuristic to map the challenges and   opportunities, but also the paradoxes of learning analytics and its  potential impact on student success and retention.    This paper explores some of these challenges, paradoxes and  opportunities with reference to two mega ODL institutions namely  the Open University in the UK (OU) and the University of South  Africa (Unisa). Although these two institutions share a number of  characteristics, there are also some major and important  differences between them.  We explore some of the shared  challenges, paradoxes and opportunities learning analytics offer in  the context of these two institutions.

INTRODUCTION  One of the basic premises of learning analytics is that if higher  education institutions optimise and analyse the data they hold on  their students, they can identity and (more) effectively and  appropriately address the challenges that students face, whether  they are at risk, underprepared or high performance students.    Siemens [10] suggests that learning analytics refers to student- produced data and analysis models to discover information and  social connections, and to predict and advise on learning  (emphasis added).  It is true that students produce data and leave  trails that higher education institutions may not fully exploit. To  focus only on the data trails which students produce may result in  the incomplete assumption that they are the primary actors in their  learning journeys. Students trails and data regarding their  activities, actions or non-actions are a useful baseline, but often  institutional decisions, efficiencies and non-action on the side of  the institution impact equally on students choices, and their  actions or non-action. This latter perhaps falls into the category of  academic rather than learning analytics, though both approaches  have many overlapping elements and both are relevant here.   We do not see learning analytics as the panacea which will solve  all the complexities in understanding student success, attrition or  retention. Several authors [7, 8] have cautioned that learning  analytics can very easily serve to increasingly bureaucratise  students learning even further, or serve a panoptical purpose and  culture of increasing surveillance rather than empowering students  and their institution to facilitate more appropriate choices.    In this paper we present two case studies and propose that  learning analytics can at least support student success if we  consider that both students and institutional data trails are found in  the student walk as the space where these two actors meet in a  Thirdspace (as described by various authors) [2, 4, 6, 9, 11].   Our discussions of the potential of learning analytics to help map  and engage with this Thirdspace are set against the concerns  expressed by Tinto [15] who bemoans the fact that, despite all the  research done since the first conceptual mappings of student  success and retention, the impact on success and retention rates  has been minimal. Tinto [14, 15] and others [5] suggest that  student departures are more of a puzzle than we (currently)  accept, and that knowing why students fail does not give us an  equal understanding of why students persist or stay despite failing.    In their attempt to unravel the student departure puzzle [5, 13]  indicate that student success and retention is a multidimensional  phenomenon where a number of interrelated and often     Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for   personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Copyright 2012 ACM 978-1-4503-1111-3/12/04 $10.00.      130    interdependent variables meet in complex relationships.  In their  socio-critical model for understanding and predicting student  success, retention and throughput, Subotzky and Prinsloo [13] aim  to provide a conceptual map to identity measureable and  actionable data in contrast with data which may ostensibly shape  student success, but which are outside the locus of control of both  students and the institution. They propose that three interrelated  and often interdependent levels of factors impact on student  success namely: individual (academic and attitudinal attributes,  and other personal characteristics and circumstances); institutional  (quality and relevance of academic, non-academic, and  administrative services); and supra-institutional (macro-political  and socio-economic factors) [13].   Subotzky and Prinsloo [13] propose a number of constructs that  underscore their socio-critical conceptual model; and which we  find useful as a shared point of departure for our comparative  analysis and discussion of the role of learning analytics in mega  open distance learning institutions. The constructs are as follows:   1. Students and the institution as situated agents: Success is  seen as the outcome of the mutually influential activities,  behaviours, attitudes, and responsibilities of students and  the institution. The situatedness of their agency relates to  the structural conditions of their historical, geographical,  socio-economic, and cultural backgrounds and  circumstances. Within these structural constraints, both  students and the institution are agents, and not merely  passive recipients or providers of services.   2. The second construct is that of the student walk which  embodies the mutually constitutive interactions and  relations between students and the institution.    3. The notion, amount and role of capital  whether social,  epistemological, intellectual or other forms of capital   provides a basis for understanding the socio-critical nature  of the student walk where mutual engagement and  transformation are shaped by engagement and exchanges.   4. The fourth construct refers to the impact of habitus on the  agency of both students and the institution, where habitus  refers to refers to socially acquired, embodied systems of  dispositions and/or predispositions [3].   5. The fifth construct is the notion that both students and the  institution have inter and intra-relational aspect shaping  their agency. Students intrapersonal relations are shaped by  self-efficacy, attribution and locus of control, while their  interpersonal relations are the multiple networks impacting  and shaping students learning. Self-efficacy, attribution and  locus of control also apply to the institution within three  different domains namely academic, administrative, and  non-academic social domains of institutional life.    6. Student success, as a final construct is more broadly  constructed than just course success, but also refers to  students satisfaction with their learning journeys, optimal  fit between their aspirations and abilities and the  institutions offerings. Student success can also imply not  graduating or completing their initial educational aims.    Though the detail of the mapping of students journeys differs  between the OU and Unisa, the constructs developed by Subotzky  and Prinsloo [13] encompass, from our understanding, a shared  basis for our continued exploration.   In determining the potential for analytics to help us make sense of  students journeys through a Thirdspace, we must also accept  that it is not always feasible, from a student or from an  institutional perspective, to act on what the data may be telling us.   2. THE STUDENT JOURNEY AS  THIRDSPACE   The conceptual model described above illustrates a Thirdspace,  a mostly temporary nexus where students and the institution  engage. In a certain sense, this nexus of engagement is a  temporary diasporic space for both students and institution. The  notion of Thirdspace, liminal or diasporic space is used in a  range of contexts such as identity, multicultural,  phenomenological geography and identity theories discourses by  authors such as Bhabha [2], Brah [4] and Soja [11]. Soja [11]  describes the Firstspace as the material world in which individuals  and communities live; Secondspace as their mental world of  beliefs, assumptions and epistemologies. Thirdspace is the space  where these two worlds merge and become one temporal space. In  the work of Bhabha [2], third space functions as a space where  individuals negotiate and renegotiate their assumptions, beliefs,  identities in a constant space of becoming.    The notion of Thirdspace is not commonly used in describing  the engagement between students and institutions, except for by  Burnapp [6], Whitchurch [16] and in an indirect sense, Barnett  [1]. Burnapp [6] uses the notion of the Thirdspace in describing  international student experiences whilst Whitchurch [16] uses it to  describe the fluidness of academic identity in a digital age.   Barnett [1] refers to the notion of a third world where students  find themselves in their trajectories of being and becoming. In  this so-called third world or Thirdspace, students have left the  known pre-enrolment spaces and move into a space where their  identities, epistemologies and ontologies are shaped by their  engagement with academic and professional discourses. A student  enrolling in higher education moves from often a highly  structured place to an undefined and liminal and unstructured  space [6]. In this Thirdspace students are caught in a liminal  space between what they were and what they are becoming. They  may be labelled as underprepared, at risk, illiterate, or  deficient  and blamed for not fitting in into the world of  higher education. Early conceptual models attempting to  understand and map student success and retention  disproportionately emphasised the responsibility of students to fit  in, to prepare for and ensure that they are sufficiently assimilated  and integrated into the epistemologies and ways of being required  by the higher education of their choice (see for example [5], [13]).    The student walk as Thirdspace is a temporary space where yet  another identity construct and role are imposed on students. This  new identity shapes and is shaped by their other identities as  mothers, professionals, etc. Students and especially distance  education students in ODL settings do not leave their other  identities outside of their learning, but rather find them in ever- increasing networks of identity constructs. On the other hand,  students engagement with their studies and institution has the  potential to shape their multiple identities in often profound ways.   This Thirdspace also has implications for the institution which  provides learning based on students choices, prior knowledge and  aspirations. The success of the ability of the institution to match  the aspirations, prior knowledge and levels of preparedness of  students has a profound impact on the success of students,  attrition and throughput rates.   Although this Thirdspace is actually, in the context of ODL, a  non-place or a space of placelessness [6],  students and other  institutional stakeholders leave traces which, if harvested, can  help us to understand the complexities of student success, attrition  and throughput. Using the actionable intelligence provided by  learning analytics allows this Thirdspace to be a safe and critical   131    non-place of becoming. We suggest that the notion of a  Thirdspace provides useful pointers for understanding the  potential of learning analytics in higher education institutions and  more particularly, in mega ODL institutions.   We now turn briefly to providing short overviews of two different  ODL contexts as basis for our exploration of the challenges,  paradoxes and potential of learning analytics.   3. ANALYTICS AT THE OPEN  UNIVERSITY: A SHORT CASE STUDY  The OU supports around 200,000 students each year and collects  vast amounts of data about its students, the majority of which is  been collated and disseminated to academic units and support  departments by a central unit. This unit provides several services  in support of the University in supplying external reports and in  helping internal staff to better understand student cohorts:    Providing information systems and easy access to student  retention and progression data, and demographic profiles     Delivering and reporting internal and external institutional  surveys (student feedback)     Disseminating institutional data and information analysis    Collaborating internally to undertake ad-hoc projects aimed   at enhancing the quality of the student experience     Supporting internal review processes and external audits    Academic teams typically make use of faculty or module level  information to inform curriculum design, for example, by using  feedback from surveys sent to students at the end of their module.  Other datasets relating to points of withdrawal and student such  information have been used to create, for example, a single  University-wide model of vulnerability based on historical shared  student characteristics.   At a very broad level then, the OU has made good use of ongoing  data to make adjustments to curriculum design and to form a view  of how to provide effective student support. This understanding is  well communicated and has provided a shared understanding of a  model of support as a generic good fit for all students.    Since 2005, the OU has captured all outward and inward  communications with students and tutors. Currently, over 7.5  million contacts have been recorded, each categorized to reflect  the nature of the contact and the resultant outcomes.    Until recently, this dataset has largely been a repository for  student information and has not been widely exploited to extract  cohort information, patterns of behaviour or useful insights into  commonalities between programmes of study, approaches to  assessment and modes of delivery.    In the last two years, greater use has been made of this  information and data captured at registration, to develop a fuller  understanding of the reasons which lead to student contact and the  triggers for student behaviours, which can then be matched to a  variety of anticipatory support behaviours.    In addition, much work has been invested in the OUs ability to  interrogate its Moodle-based VLE system to track student  behaviour and engagement on and between modules.    The OU is now moving toward a tailored, at scale and largely  automated approach to student support that does not assume that a  single model of support fits all, but allows curriculum-based  support teams to provide the most time effective, appropriate  support for their own student cohort.     4. ANALYTICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF  SOUTH AFRICA: A SHORT CASE STUDY  Unisa reports to various national higher education and legislative  networks on student throughput, module success, and attrition.  Most of the data required relates to programme cohort analysis,  though analyses regarding student profiles and success in  individual modules are also available. Analyses are also available  on request by departments, schools or individual lecturers.    Until recently, most of the analyses were used by institutional  structures for operational planning purposes, and, to a lesser  extent, by departments and/or individual lecturers in planning  module specific interventions or teaching strategies.    Up to 2010, academic and learning analytics at Unisa remained  fragmented. There was no coherent and shared understanding of  student success as a phenomenon, nor any committee or task team  that were either representative of all stakeholders involved in the  development, delivery and support of teaching and learning; nor  having access to appropriate analyses of institutional and module  (course)-specific trends.  Different departments responded in their  individual capacities to increase student success and retention.    Compounding the impact of this fragmented approach was the  fact that the analyses conducted focused more on cohort analyses  in programmes and institution-wide trends, and not necessarily at  module level. In addition, institution-wide interventions and  strategies impacted on individual modules with no input from the  academic and tutoring staff involved in those modules.    However, 2010 saw a major change in the institutional  comprehension of the role and impact of learning analytics. Three  major developments emerged, namely   1. The development and formal acceptance of the socio-critical  conceptual model [13] has provided Unisa with an integrated  and shared framework for understanding and predicting  student success and retention. While there was a general  understanding of the notion of the student walk or student  journey, there was no clear understanding of the  complexities facing both students and the institution in their  reciprocal engagement in a Thirdspace.    Successful implementation of a framework will hugely  depend on the role and function of learning analytics.  Currently the main centralised sources of student data are:    Information provided by students during the application  and registration processes    Submission of assignments    Financial interactions with the University    Student activity on the learning management system   Other data sources, for example, interactions with tutors or  support staff, are not centrally recorded.    2. The second major development in the context of realizing a  future for learning analytics is the development and piloting  of a student tracking system. The aim is to map student risk  on all currently held historical data. This system will  eventually house and track all interactions between students  and the institution and generate automated (where  appropriate) and personal proactive and reactive responses.   3. The third and final development realizing the potential of  learning analytics is the formation of a Student Success  Committee. This comprises the major role-players dealing  with student retention and success ranging from Senate to  administrative, professional and academic departments.    132    5. CHALLENGES, PARADOXES AND  POINTERS  From the above case studies, the following issues emerge:    Both institutions (like most other higher education and ODL  institutions) have huge student datasets.     Perversely, the sheer volume of available data can act as a  constraint rather than as an enabler of better understanding  both student and institutional behaviours.    At present it is not clear whether the two institutions in  question fully understand or have a conceptual map of how  the data is used, by whom, and for what purpose.    Both institutions provide analytical services to a range of  customers but may need a meta-picture of how data is used  and the impact of different strategies based on analyses.     How do overarching institutional goals, for example,  widening participation and open access act with or against  messages provided by analyses That is, mega ODL  institutions are often balancing conflicting drivers.    While the two institutions in question have different structures  and different approaches to the notion of cohort, it is not clear  whether there is an institutional perspective which makes  sense of cohort and module specific trends.     It is not clear how the results of analyses flow through the  organisation, that is, to individuals or support departments and  back    Monitoring and evaluation of support systems based largely  on the output of an analytics approach needs to be ongoing for  support systems to remain effective and optimal. Such  analyses are time intensive.      Both institutions encourage the scholarship of teaching and  learning to increase evidence-based approaches to  interventions aimed at improving student retention and  success. How best then to capture and integrate scholarship  practices into institutional sense making processes     Academics involved in such scholarship may find their efforts  to change delivery and teaching strategies based on found  evidence frustrated by a lack of institutional support.     Although the data may suggest tailoring, it is not practical for  mega ODL institutions to have a multitude of differentiated  support systems in place.   There are however also some pointers for consideration. The use  of analytics at all levels would be more successful if founded on a  shared and institutionally-accepted conceptual understanding of  the nexus or Thirdspace of student and institutional interaction.  Analytics should provide an integrated, coordinated and holistic  platform for all stakeholders to make sense of and find their own  way in supporting student learning and institutional efficiency  recognising interrelations and interdependencies.   It falls outside of the scope of this paper to argue for a centralised  or decentralised approach to analytics, but rather to point to a need  for an integrated, coordinated and holistic approach involving all  stakeholders who can contribute or use the analyses.    6. CONCLUSIONS  Learning analytics aims to help us to teach more effectively by  providing us timely and appropriate actionable data on which to  make choices regarding pedagogy, assessment strategies, student  support interventions and use of technology to mention but a few.    Using the notion of Thirdspace to describe the space where  students and institution meet, we explored some of the challenges,   paradoxes and potential for learning analytics to better support  learning outcomes and student success. If learning analytics is  considered only as a tool, then simply having more information  about our students may not necessarily change the way we teach.  There would be a danger that learning analytics might become  part of the broader bureaucratisation of student learning.    If however, learning analytics is embedded in organisational  culture, systems, and processes, there is the potential to really  impact and shape our approaches to student needs, whether as  individuals or as groups.   Learning analytics is an essential tool for mega ODL institutions  for personalising learning as far as possible for very diverse  groups of students with even more diverse prior experiences,  contexts, aspirations and futures.    7.
