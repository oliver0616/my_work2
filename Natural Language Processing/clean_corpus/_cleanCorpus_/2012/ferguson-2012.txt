SLA focuses on how learners build knowledge together in their   cultural and social settings. In the context of online social   learning, it takes into account both formal and informal   educational environments, including networks and communities.   The paper introduces the broad rationale for SLA by reviewing   some of the key drivers that make social learning so important   today. Five forms of SLA are identified, including those which   are inherently social, and others which have social dimensions.   The paper goes on to describe early work towards implementing   these analytics on SocialLearn, an online learning space in use at   the UKs Open University, and the challenges that this is raising.   This work takes an iterative approach to analytics, encouraging   learners to respond to and help to shape not only the analytics but   also their associated recommendations.

INTRODUCTION  The field of learning analytics has its roots in the appropriation   of business intelligence concepts by educational institutions: the   earlir terms academic analytics [1] and action analytics [2]   refer respectively to the capture and report of data by educational   administrators, and to the need for benchmarking to increase the   effectiveness of educational institutions. Learning analytics shift   the perspective from that of the institution gathering data about   learners in order to inform organisational objectives, to that of   providing new tools for the learner and teacher, drawing on   experience from the learning sciences with the intention of   understanding and optimizing not only learning but also the   environments in which it takes place.   As part of this shift to learner-centred design, we propose that   Social Learning Analytics (SLA) can be usefully thought of as a   subset of learning analytics, which draws on the substantial body   of work evidencing that new skills and ideas are not solely   individual achievements, but are developed, carried forward, and   passed on through interaction and collaboration. A socio-cultural   strand of educational research demonstrates how language is   itself one of the primary tools through which learners construct   meaning, and its use is influenced by the aims, feelings and   relationships of their users, all of which shift according to   context [3] (as will be seen, discourse and context are two foci of   the SLA we propose). Another strand of research emphasises that   learning cannot be understood by focusing solely on the   cognition, development or behaviour of individual learners;   neither can it be understood without reference to its situated   nature [4, 5].    As groups engage in joint activities, their success is related to a   combination of individual knowledge and skills, environment,   use of tools, and ability to work together. Understanding learning   in these settings requires us to pay attention to group processes   of knowledge construction  how sets of people learn together   using tools in different settings. The focus must be not only on   learners, but also on their tools and contexts.   Viewing learning analytics from a social perspective highlights   types of analytic that can be employed to make sense of learner   activity in a social setting. This does not require the development   of a completely new set of tools; this paper cites numerous   examples of related work in context. Instead, it groups a range of   pre-existing and new tools and approaches to form the basis of a   coherent set. In doing so, it identifies ways in which analytics   may be developed and implemented in order to identify social   behaviours and patterns that signify effective process in learning   environments. The aim is to use analytics not only to identify   these but also to render them both visible and actionable.   The paper is organized as follows. We introduce the broad   rationale for focusing on social learning (2), which is then   developed specific to several forms of analytic which are   inherently social (3), or which have social dimensions (4). We   then describe progress towards the implementation of these      Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not  made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear  this notice and the full citation on the first page.

WHY SOCIAL LEARNING ANALYTICS  The focus on SLA reflects shifts in the broader cultural,   technological and business landscapes, which together are   reshaping the educational landscape platforms. We see these as a   set of drivers for the growing importance of online social   learning, and hence, for SLA.   2.1 Social media  No review of the forces shaping the educational landscape can   ignore the digital revolution. Only very recently have we had the   right infrastructural ingredients to provide almost ubiquitous   internet access in wealthy countries and mobile access in many   more. In addition, we now have user interfaces that have evolved   through intensive use, digital familiarity from an early age,   standards enabling interoperability and commerce across diverse   platforms, and scalable computing architectures capable of   servicing billions of real-time users, and mining that data. With   the rise of very large social websites such as Facebook, YouTube   and Twitter, plus the thousands of smaller versions and niche   applications for specific tasks and communities, we have   witnessed a revolution in the way that people think about online   interaction and publishing. Such social media platforms facilitate   the publishing, indexing and tracking of user-generated media,   provide simple to learn collaboration spaces, and enable a new   set of social gestures that are becoming ubiquitous, and   expected by the current generations: friending, following,   messaging, microblogging, liking, rating, etc.   Potential implication: As ubiquitous access to social networks   become a critical part of learners online identity, and an   expected part of learning platforms, social learning analytics   should provide tools to provoke learning-centric reflection on   how interpersonal relationships and interactions reflect   learning, or can be more effectively used to advance learning.   2.2 Open/free content and data   There has been a huge shift in expectations about access to   digital content. Learners expect increasingly to find reasonable   quality information on the Web for free, to the point where they   often feel aggrieved when confronted by a request for money, and   will seek free avenues first. Within education, the Open   Educational Resource (OER) movement has been a powerful   vehicle for making institutions aware of the value of making   quality learning material available, not only for free, but in   formats that promote remixing, in an effort to reap the benefits   seen in the open source software movement. This has by no   means proven to be a simple matter, since educational staff,   materials and institutions are different in important respects from   open source programmers, source code and developer networks,   but OER has made huge progress, and is gaining visibility at the   highest levels of educational policy.   Free and open learning resources are mirrored by efforts within   the open and linked data communities to make data open to   machine processing as well as human interpretation. This   requires both the shift in mindset by data owners (which OER   has had to effect within education), as well as the laying of   technological infrastructure to make it possible to publish data in   useful formats.    Potential implication: A consequence of the information   overload that now confronts learners is the need for more   effective filtering and navigation, and it is here that social   networks are playing an increasing role, as a means to maximize   the increasingly scarce resource at a learners disposal: focused   attention. SLA should augment learners capacities to build   effective social learning networks.   2.3 Society increasingly values participation  Technology is always appropriated to serve what people believe   to be their needs and values. Beyond what we can observe for   ourselves informally, there is a significant body of research   indicating that the period in which we find ourselves is moving   towards a set of values mirrored in the affordances of social   media. In 1997, the World Values Survey covered 43 societies,   representing 70% of the worlds population. Inglehart [6] argued   that the shift to postmaterialism (a finding from earlier surveys)   was confirmed and he offered a new postmodernization   framework. He suggested that modernization helped society   move from poverty to economic security, and that the success of   this move led to a shift in what people want out of life. In   postmodernity, as he used the term, people value autonomy and   diversity over authority, hierarchy, and conformity. According to   Inglehart, postmodern values bring declining confidence in   religious, political, and even scientific authority; they also bring   a growing mass desire for participation and self-expression. We   find these results interesting: on the one hand it is easy to   recognise this shift in wealthy nations, but this shift seems also   to be reflected even in the less developed regions surveyed,   where poverty is still clearly a daily reality.    Another perspective on the shift in social value is the view that,   since 1991, we have lived in the knowledge age  a period in   which knowledge, rather than labour, land or capital, has been a   key wealth-generating resource [7]. This shift has occurred   within a period when constant change in society has ben the   norm, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to tell which   specific knowledge and skills will be required in the future [8].   These changes have prompted an interest in knowledge-age   skills that will allow learners to become both confident and   competent designers of their own learning goals [9]. Accounts of   knowledge-age skills vary, but they can be broadly categorized as   relating to learning, management, people, information,   research/enquiry, citizenship, values/attributes and preparation   for the world of work [10]. From one viewpoint they are   important because employers are looking for problem-solvers,   people who take responsibility and make decisions and are   flexible, adaptable and willing to learn new skills [11, p5].   More broadly, knowledge-age skills are related not just to an   economic imperative but to a desire and a right to know, an   extension of educational opportunities, and a responsibility to   realize a cosmopolitan understanding of universal rights and   acting on that understanding to effect a greater sense of   community [12, p111].    Potential implication: Research evidencing the growing desire in   many societies for civic participation and self-expression   provides another driver for social learning. Another is within   education, with the perceived need to move away from a   curriculum based on a central canon of information, towards   learning that develops skills and competencies for coping with   24    complexity and novel challenges. SLA should augment learners   capacities to assess themselves on 21 st  Century skills.   2.4 Innovation depends on social connection  The conditions for online social learning are also related to the   pressing need for effective innovation in organisational life. In a   succinct synthesis of the literature, Hagel, et al. [13] argue that   social learning is the only way in which organisations can cope   with the unprecedented turbulence they now face. They invoke   the concept of pull as an umbrella term to signal some   fundamental shifts in the ways in which we catalyse learning and   innovation, and argue that the world is changing so rapidly that   useful knowledge/understanding (in contrast to data or   information) is rarely well codified, indexed or formalized, while   socially transmitted knowledge is growing in importance as a   source of timely, trustworthy insight. This leads them to   highlight quality of interpersonal relationships, tacit knowing,   discourse and personal passion as key capacities to foster, as we   move in business from mere transactional relationships, to   building and sustaining more meaningful relationships.    Potential implication: These business trends serve as another   driver for social learning, and invite opportunities for SLA to   augment personal and collective capacities by investigating how   we can make visible representations of quality of interpersonal   relationships, tacit knowing, discourse and personal passion.   2.5 Summary  We have reviewed some of the tectonic forces reshaping the   learning landscape. These are signals that many futures   analysts and horizon scanning reports on learning technology   have highlighted as significant. If taken together, these are   shaping a radically new context for learning, then by extension,   learning analytics must be reframed accordingly to place online   social interaction and the social construction of knowledge at the   heart of their models.    We now introduce five categories of analytic whose foci are   driven by the implications of the drivers reviewed above. The   first two categories are inherently social, while the other three   can be socialized, ie. usefully applied in social settings:    social network analytics  interpersonal relationships  define social platforms    discourse analytics language is a primary tool for  knowledge negotiation and construction    content analytics  user-generated content is one of  the defining characteristics of Web 2.0    disposition analytics  intrinsic motivation to learn is  a defining feature of online social media, and lies at the   heart of engaged learning, and innovation    context analytics  mobile computing is transforming  access to both people and content.   We do not present these five categories as an exhaustive   taxonomy, since this would normally be driven by, for instance,   a specific pedagogical theory or technological framework, in   order to motivate the category distinctions. We are not grounding   our work in a single theory of social learning, nor do we think   that a techno-centric taxonomy is helpful. The social learning   platform and analytics we are developing is in response to the   spectrum of drivers reviewed above, drawing on diverse   pedagogical and technological underpinnings which will be   introduced with each category.   3. INHERENTLY SOCIAL TYPES OF  LEARNING ANALYTIC   3.1 Social learning network analytics  Networked learning uses ICT to promote connections between   learners, tutors, communities and resources [14]. These networks   consist of actors  both people and resources  and the relations   between them. A tie describes the relationship between these   actors and can be classified as strong or weak, depending on its   frequency, quality or importance [15]. People make use of weak   ties with people they trust when accessing new knowledge or   engaging in informal learning, and go on to make increasing use   of strong ties with trusted individuals as they deepen and embed   their knowledge [16].   Social network analysis investigates ties, relations, roles and   network formations, and a social learning network analysis is   concerned with how these are developed and maintained to   support learning [15]. Because of its focus on the development of   relationships, and its view that technology forms part of this   process, this type of analysis offers the possibility of identifying   interventions that are likely to increase a networks potential to   support the learning of its actors.   Social network analysis can be approached from the perspective   of an individual or of the entire network. An egocentric approach   may identify the people who support an individuals learning, the   origin of conflicts in understanding, and some of the contextual   factors that influence learning. On the other hand, a whole-  network view provides insight into the interests and practices of   a set of people, identifying elements that hold the network   together [17]. It also has the potential to help with the   identification of groupings within a network that can support   learning, for example communities and affinity groups [18, 19].   As social network analysis is developed and refined in the   context of social learning, it has the potential to be combined   with other types of social learning analytic in order to define   what counts as a learning tie and thus to identify interactions   which promote the learning process. It also has the potential to   be extended in order take more account of socio-material   networks, identifying and, where appropriate, strengthening and   developing indirect relationships between people which are   characterised by the ways in which they interact with the same   objects of knowledge [20].   3.2 Social learning discourse analytics  The ties between learners in a network are typically established   or strengthened by their use of dialogue. These interactions can   be studied using the various forms of discourse analysis that offer   ways of understanding the large amounts of text generated in   online courses and conferences. For example, Schrire [21] used  discourse analysis to understand the relationship between the   interactive, cognitive and discourse dimensions of online   interaction, examining initiation, response and follow-up (IRF)   exchanges. More recently, Lapadat [22] has applied discourse   analysis to asynchronous discussions between students and   tutors, showing how groups of learners create and maintain   community and coherence through the use of discursive devices.   25    Corpus linguistics, the study of language based on examples of   real-life use, is a method of discourse analysis that relies heavily   on electronic tools and computer processing power. This method   employs software to facilitate quantitative investigation of vast   corpora including millions of words of both speech and text [23].    Educational success and failure have been related to the quality   of learners educational dialogue [24]. Social learning discourse   analytics can be employed to analyse, and potentially to   influence, dialogue quality. The ways in which learners engage   in dialogue indicate how they engage with the ideas of others,   how they relate those ideas to their personal understanding and   how they explain their own point of view. Mercer and his   colleagues distinguished three social modes of thinking used by   groups of learners in face-to-face environments: disputational,   cumulative and exploratory talk [25-28]. Disputational dialogue   is characterised by disagreement and individual decisions; in   cumulative dialogue speakers build on the contributions of others   without critiquing or challenging them. Educators typically   consider exploratory dialogue the most desirable because it   involves speakers explaining their reasoning, challenging ideas,   evaluating evidence and developing understanding together.   Learning analytics researchers have built on this work to provide   insight into textual discourse in online learning [29, 30],   providing a bridge to the world of social learning analytics.   A related approach to social learning discourse analytics employs   a structured deliberation/argument mapping platform to study   what learners are paying attention to, what they focus on, which   viewpoints they take up, how learning topics are distributed   amongst participants, how learners are linked by semantic   relationships such as support and challenge, and how learners   react to different ideas and contributions [31]. This approach to   overlaying discourse network models on social network models   exemplifies what makes social learning analytics distinctive   from generic social network analytics, which examine topology   but take no account of the quality of stakeholder interactions.   4. SOCIALIZED LEARNING ANALYTICS   In this section, we consider three kinds of analytic, which   although meaningful for an isolated learner who is making no use   of interpersonal connections or social media platforms, take on   significant new dimensions in the context of social learning.   4.1 Social learning content analytics  Content analytics is used here as a broad heading for the   various automated methods used to examine, index and filter   online media assets for learners. (Note that this not identical to   content analysis, which is concerned with description of the   latent and/or manifest elements of communication [32].) These   analytics may be used to provide recommendations of resources   tailored to the needs of an individual or a group of learners. This   is a very fast-moving field, and the state of the art in textual and   video information retrieval tools is displayed annually in   competitions such as the Text Retrieval Conference [see 33 for a   review].   One example is visual similarity search, which uses features of   images in order to find material that is visually related, thus   supporting navigation of educational materials in a variety of   ways, including identifying the source of an image, finding items   that offer different ways of understanding a concept, or finding   other content in which a given image or movie frame is used   [34].    This takes on a social learning aspect when it makes use of the   tags, ratings and other data supplied by learners. An example is   iSpot, a citizen science social media site that helps learners to   identify anything in the natural world [35]. When a photo is first   uploaded to the site, it usually has little to connect it with other   information. The addition of a possible identification by another   user ties the image to other sets of data held externally. In the   case of iSpot, this analysis is not solely based on the by-products   of interaction; each users reputation within the network is used   to weight the data that they add. This suggests one way in which   content analytics can be combined with social network analytics   to support learning.   Other approaches to content analytics are more closely aligned   with content analysis. These involve examination of the latent   elements that can be identified within transcripts of exchanges   between people learning together online. This method has been   used to investigate a variety of issues related to online social   learning, including collaborative learning, presence and online   cooperation [36]. These latent elements of interpersonal   exchanges could also support sentiment analysis, revealing   learners emotions such as happiness and frustration.    It is also possible to draw on the manifest information about user   activity and behaviour that is provided by tools such as Google   Analytics and userfly.com as well as by the tools built into   virtual learning environments (VLEs) such as Moodle and   Blackboard. This is the approach taken by LOCO-Analyst, which   uses content analysis to establish and investigate semantic   relations between different learning resources and to provide   feedback for content authors and teachers that can help them to   improve their online courses [37].    4.2 Social learning disposition analytics  Learners who are prepared to learn and are open to new ideas   have the potential to make good use of these resources and tools.   A well established research programme has identified,   theoretically, empirically and statistically, a seven-dimensional   model of learning dispositions, termed learning power [38].   These dispositions can be used to render visible the complex   mixture of experience, motivation and intelligences that make up   an individuals capacity for lifelong learning and influence   responses to learning opportunities [39]. Learning dispositions   are not learning styles, which have been critiqued on a variety   of grounds, including lack of contextual awareness [40]. In   contrast, an important characteristic of learning dispositions is   that they have been validated as varying according to a range of   variables [41]. As detailed in [41], a learning analytics platform   and visual analytic has been developed to model and assess such   dispositions and transferable skills. This visual analytic is used   to reflect back to learners their self-perception on these   dimensions, providing an explicit language for describing   dispositions, catalysing changes in their engagement, activities   and approach to learning.   From a social learning perspective, three elements of disposition   analytics are particularly important. Firstly, they draw learners   attention to the importance of relationships and interdependence   as one of the seven key learning dispositions. Secondly, they can   be used to support learners as they reflect on their ways of   26    perceiving, processing and reacting to learning interactions.   Finally, they play a central role in an extended mentoring   relationship. This type of relationship has an important role in   online social learning, especially when learning is informal and   not teacher-led. Mentors motivate, encourage, challenge and   counsel learners, and can also provide opportunities to rehearse   arguments and increase understanding [42, 43].    4.3 Social learning context analytics   All these types of social learning analytic can be applied in a   wide variety of contexts, including formal settings such as   universities, informal contexts in which learners choose both the   process and the goal of their learning [44] and in the many   situations in which learners are using mobile devices [45]. In   some cases, many learners are simultaneously engaged in the   same activity, and in other cases learning takes place in   asynchronous environments, where the assumption is that is that   learners will be participating at different times [30]. They may be   learning alone, in a network, in an affinity group, in communities   of inquiry, communities of interest or communities of practice   [18, 46-48].   Context analytics are the analytic tools that expose, make use   of or seek to understand these contexts. These analytics may be   used alone, or may be employed as higher-level tools, pulling   together data produced by other analytics. For example, if   network analysis indicates that student Rebecca is on the edge of   a community, and dispositions analysis shows that she is   currently working on her collaboration skills, then a context-  focused recommendation might suggest that she could join a   teamwork skills group and use analytics visualizations to monitor   her position within the group. Several weeks later, she might be   prompted to reflect on her collaboration skills and to rate the   group. She might receive this prompt directly from the system, or   the system could recommend her teacher, mentor or group leader   to engage with her and to make the recommendation.   5. DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION  Having identified different types of social learning analytic, the   challenge is to employ these to analyse learners behaviour and   to offer visualizations and recommendations that can be shown to   spark and support learning. This section focuses on progress   towards the implementation of these analytics in a social learning   space developed by The Open University, a UK-based university   with a strong emphasis on open and distance learning.    SocialLearn is a social media space tuned for learning. It has   been designed to support online social learning by helping users   to clarify their intention, to ground their learning and to engage   in learning conversations [49]. The systems architecture   includes a Recommendation Engine, a pipeline designed to   process data and output it in a form for analysis by SocialLearn   recommendation web services.   The second element of SocialLearns architecture is the Identity   Server that supplies, with the learners informed consent, data to   the Recommendation Engine. These data include learners   profiles and activities within SocialLearn, selected elements of   their activity at The Open University, and selected elements of   their activity and interactions on social media sites such as   LinkedIn, Twitter and sites employing OpenID. The SocialLearn   Analytics and Delivery Channels depend on the Identity Server to   maintain a unified user profile.   The final element of SocialLearns architecture is the SL   Delivery Channel, which includes sites for both input and output.   Data are collected, with the learners informed consent, from use   of the SocialLearn website, from use of the SocialLearn   backpack (browser toolbar) while elsewhere on the web, from   use of SocialLearn applications embedded on external sites and,   where applicable, from calls on the SocialLearn application   programming interface (API). At the same time, data that has   been analysed by the Recommendation Engine may be presented   to learners in the form of recommendations or visualizations   available on the SocialLearn website, via the SocialLearn   backpack, within embedded applications or by ways of calls on   the API. Reactions to these visualizations and recommendations,   together with options for feedback by learners, make this an   iterative process because these responses are fed back via the SL   Delivery Channel and influence subsequent output.   The architecture is designed to be flexible, so that new   algorithms can be added at any time, and analytics can be trialed,   developed, combined or set aside without disruption.   Sections 4.1-4.6 describe progress towards the implementation of   different types of social learning analytic, including work carried   out at The Open University and elsewhere that supports the   development of social learning analytics, recommendations and   visualizations. Work on some types of social learning analytic is   still at the stage of planning how work carried out elsewhere   might be adapted. In other cases, mock-ups and wireframes are   in place or pilot studies are underway.   5.1 Implementing social learning network  analytics   In the case of social learning network analytics, the SocialLearn   team is considering the possibilities offered by SNAPP (Social   Networks Adapting Pedagogical Practice), a freely available   network visualization tool that analyses forum contributions and   presents them as a network diagram. Its architects identify uses   for such diagrams from the point of view of teachers, including:    identifying disconnected students    identifying key information brokers within a class    indicating the extent to which a learning community is  developing within a class [50]   In the case of SocialLearn, the intention is to deploy social   learning network analytics to exploit data in the Identity Server,   in order to support both individual and group recommendations.   For example, individuals might see:    One of your key search terms is learning analytics. This  has been mentioned five times in the Future Developments   thread. View thread    John Smith has been identified as a key information broker  in your network, View Johns most recent posts    Ten people you have replied to list social learning as a key  search term. Add this to your key search terms   In learning groups that are not formally led by a teacher,   members may share responsibility for welcoming newcomers,   engaging all members and encouraging meaningful participation.   Social learning network feedback for a group or moderator will   seek to use what is known about effective group structure and   dynamics and feed this back for reflection [51]. For example:   27     Research shows that effective learning groups tend to be  structured like this <network diagram> whereas your group   currently looks like this <group diagram>.   5.2 Implementing social learning discourse  analytics   In order to support meaningful participation, SocialLearn is   developing two sets of discourse analytics  the first based on the   work of Neil Mercer and his colleagues around exploratory   dialogue [27], and the second building on development of   Contested Collective Intelligence and Concept Mapping to   scaffold structured deliberation and argument mapping [52].   Key characteristics of exploratory dialogue include challenge,   evaluation, reasoning and extension. Initial research suggests that   these are signaled in forum interaction by key words and phrases   [29]. For example: alternative, but if and I dont believe   suggest challenge; good point, important and how much   suggest evaluation; next step, its like and relates to suggest   extension, and does that mean, my understanding and take   your point suggest reasoning. Figure 1 shows how a   visualization of these elements of dialogue could be presented to   learners, together with recommendations.   The coloured shapes in Figure 1 indicate comparative levels of   use of different types of dialogue. In this case, indicators of   reasoning, evaluation and extension appeared several times   within the learners discussion and are represented by green   squares. Only one challenge was detected, and this lower level is   represented by a yellow circle. The final sentence, Positive   challenges suggests ways of increasing indicators of   exploratory dialogue.      Figure 1: Visualization of learners use of indicators of   exploratory dialogue   This example focuses on a single learner. A group version of the   visualization could be used to represent the dialogue of a group   or a thread, with the aim of achieving a more widespread shift in   the quality of the learning dialogue.   Explicit semantic networks provide a computational system with   a more meaningful understanding of the relationships between   ideas than natural language. Following the established   methodological value of Concept Mapping [53], the mapping of   issues, ideas and arguments extends this to make explicit the   presence of more than one perspective and the lines of reasoning   associated with each.    In a comprehensive review of computer-supported argumentation   [54], Scheuer et al concluded that studies have demonstrated   more relevant claims and arguments disagreeing and   rebutting other positions more frequently and engaging in   argumentation of a higher formal quality. However, appropriate   tools need to be part of an effective learning design:   The overall pedagogical setup, including sequencing of   activities, distributions of roles, instruction on how to use   diagramming tools, usage of additional external   communication tools, and collaboration design, has an   influence on learning outcomes [54]   On this basis, Cohere is being developed to interoperate with   SocialLearn. As preliminary results show [31], this holds the   promise of giving the platform access to proxy indicators of   participants attitudes towards the topic under discussion, and of   the roles they play within the group (e.g. forging meaningful   links between peers contributions, or a tendency to challenge   others). This provides the representational basis to automate   recommendations that encourage new approaches to a given   subject, either by providing links to resources that challenge or   extend learners point of view, or by providing links to other   groups talking about the same subject or resources but in   different ways.   5.3 Implementing social learning content  analytics   When viewing online resources, SocialLearns Backpack  a   toolbar of apps and resources  can be used on any Internet site.    The Backpack currently includes the basic components of social   learning content analytics. Clicking on the Backpacks light bulb   icon provides the option of viewing the keywords, hotlinks or   images connected with the open web page (as in the large box on   the right of Figure 2). This information about images can be   combined with visual similarity search to identify and   recommend other resources that make use of these images, for   instance:      Figure 2: The SocialLearn Backpack open at the foot of a    BBC News page, showing a list of images on the page    This image appears to be The Mona Lisa, and is used  twice in this Renaissance 101 lecture webcast [view]    This image appears to be Steve Jobs, and is used in the  following blogs by academics in Design faculties   [view]   As SocialLearn develops, it will be possible to refine these   recommendations, based on the number of users following or   recommending links or on the relevance of key words on a site to   28    the key words associated with individual learners or groups of   learners. In the case of learners who are developing the learning   dispositions of resilience and critical curiosity  (the desire and   capacity to be taken out of ones comfort zone, and to dig beneath   the surface), these analytics could recommend online resources   that both stretch a learner to a new level and which are rated as   rewarding investigative skills.   5.4 Implementing social learning disposition  analytics   Theoretical and empirical evidence in the learning sciences   substantiates the view that deep engagement in learning is a   function of a complex combination of learners identities,   dispositions, values, attitudes and skills. When these are fragile,   learners struggle to achieve their potential in conventional   assessments, and critically, are not prepared for the novelty and   complexity of the challenges they will meet in the workplace,   and the many other spheres of life which require personal   qualities such as resilience, critical thinking and collaboration   skills.  As detailed in an accompanying LAK paper [41], learning   dispositions can be modelled as a multi-dimensional construct   called Learning Power, currently assessed by learner self-report   via a web questionnaire called ELLI (Effective Lifelong Learning   Inventory), whose data warehouse platform supports a range of   analytics. ELLI has been extensively validated, and is now being   piloted within The Open University [55]. ELLI generates a spider   diagram visual analytic which is used to support self-reflection   and change. Figure 3 suggests how these meta-cognitive   processes could be supported within SocialLearn.   The ELLI profile generated by completing the self-report   questionnaire appears at the top of Figure 3. In this case, the   learner saw herself as fairly strong on changing and learning,   learning relationships and meaning making, but her resilience   was low at that point. The central text indicates that, within a   mentored discussion, she agreed that she would work on this   area. Working to develop resilience involves accepting that   learning can be hard for everyone, taking on a challenge and   persisting even when the outcome and the way ahead are   uncertain. The ELLI Spider at the foot of Figure 3 visualizes her   progress since the mentored discussion. Red triangles would   indicate no activity on a dimension, yellow squares signal some   activity and green circles indicate the learner has been very   active in an area. The ELLI Spider is fed by self-report data (for   example, within a learning blog [56]) and by data about activity   and interactions that is processed within the Recommendation   Engine and provided via the Identity Server and the Delivery   Channel.    We are now operationalising the dimensions against candidate   activity traces that could signify them. For example, indicators of   growing resilience that could be fed back to the learner,   rendering the Recommendation Engines rationale transparent:    You seem to be making progress in building your  learning resilience. Last time you declared yourself   Stuck on a path you did not return to it. This time you   returned to Step 3 on Photosynthesis 101 after a week   and, after requesting help, solved the problem.         Figure 3: ELLI Profile (top) visualizing results of most   recent self-report questionnaire. ELLI Spider and summary   (bottom) highlighting recent work on dispositions   5.5 Implementing social learning context  analytics   Within SocialLearn, dispositions analysis and subsequent activity   are among the data items that feed into the Identity Server and   Delivery Channel, Together, the server and channel provide data   about a learners current context, including goals, activities,   group membership and learning roles. A future SocialLearn app   will make use of this data, adding geolocation to the mix  to   produce recommendations tailored to the learner.   Figure 4 shows a mock-up of the SocialLearn app, currently   under development, which will recommend and provide access to   learning materials in response to search terms. The app will   allow resources to be rated and recommended to individuals or to   groups. If users choose to make their location data available, this   can be used to influence recommendations, For example, if   Simon is working on Climate Change the app might suggest a   podcast on coastal defences when he visits a seaside resort, and   could provide a map showing a local site where Simon would be   able to view the effects of erosion.   29       Figure 4: Mock-up produced by designer of SocialLearn app   making use of social learning context analytics   5.6 Different dashboard views  Because SocialLearn is designed to work in a wide variety of   contexts, users are likely to move between roles while using it.   At some points they will be learners, at others mentors or   teachers and at others group leaders or administrators. In many   cases this will involve tailoring recommendations and   visualizations to take into account these different roles. The   intention is to provide different dashboard views of analytics.   Figure 5 (below) shows what an individual learners dashboard   could look like  providing Kris Mann with an overview of   different analytics and recommendations. If Kris were mentoring   someone, he would also have agreed access to elements of their   dashboard and could rate the system-generated recommendations   and add his own. As a teacher, he would need an overview of his   pupils analytics and recommendations, with clear visualizations   and teacher recommendations helping him to find his way   through these. In the role of group leader or administrator he   would need an overall view of group activity and dialogue,   without needing a breakdown of individual learners activities.   The challenge is to provide sufficient dashboard options to meet   users needs without overburdening them with possibilities.                   Figure 5: Mock-up of SocialLearn dashboard for an individual learner   30    6.  CHALLENGES AND POSSIBILITIES  All the social learning analytics described here are currently   under development. An initial and ongoing challenge is to gain   learners informed consent to their data being used to support   these analytics. Data harvesting on websites generally goes   unnoticed, it is often only by looking at the list of cookies stored   on our computer that we realise how much information about our   activity is being gathered, analysed, bought and sold. In the   context of education, analytics are likely to include sensitive   information about identity, status, background and achievements.   Ethical use therefore involves making users aware of the data   that is being collected, how it is being used and who has access   to it. This is difficult to do clearly and concisely, giving users   sufficient privacy options without overwhelming them.   At this early stage, a second challenge is to experiment with and   refine these analytics, while continuing to provide a supportive   experience for learners. In the case of social learning discourse   analytics, for example, the correlation of words and phrases with   elements of exploratory dialogue needs to be investigated in   more detail. In the case of social learning dispositions analytics,   we need to be clear which levels of activity should prompt colour   changes in the visualization, signaling a move from low to high   levels of activity. Each area of social learning analytics requires   further research in order to optimise support for learners.A final   challenge is to ensure that these analytics, recommendations and   visualizations spark and support learning. There is a danger that   learners could be overwhelmed and discouraged by the amount of   information presented to them, confused by being presented with   too many visualizations, or misled by system-generated analytics.   The SocialLearn research programme therefore works in the case   of each analytic from a theory of how learning can be triggered or   improved. It then develops an appropriate analytic and monitors   what happens when it is implemented, looking not only for the   predicted positive changes, but also for any significant changes.   At this stage, the challenge is to improve on or refine the analytic   and how it is presented to learners.    7. CONCLUSION   Social learning analytics make use of data generated by learners   online activity in order to identify behaviours and patterns within   the learning environment that signify effective process. The   intention is to make these visible to learners, to learning groups   and to teachers, together with recommendations that spark and   support learning. In order to do this, these analytics make use of   data generated when learners are socially engaged. This   engagement includes both direct interaction  particularly   dialogue  and indirect interaction, when learners leave behind   ratings, recommendations or other activity traces that can   influence the actions of others. Another important source of data   consists of users responses to these analytics and their   associated visualizations and recommendations   At present, we are focusing on the five broad categories of social   learning analytic described in this paper: network analytics,   discourse analytics, content analytics, dispositions analytics and   context analytics. The Open University is currently developing   these within SocialLearn, which provides a technical architecture   enabling different analytics and recommenders to be deployed.   Their initial deployment in 2011-12 is part of a research   programme at the university, focused on the effective use of   social learning analytics through evaluation of both their use and   their effects. In addition, the research programme is beginning to   address some of the important challenges relating to the ethical   use of data to support learning.   8.
