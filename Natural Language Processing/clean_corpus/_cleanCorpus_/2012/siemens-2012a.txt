Two research communities  Educational Data Mining (EDM)  and Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) have developed  separately to address this need. This paper argues for increased  and formal communication and collaboration between these  communities in order to share research, methods, and tools for  data mining and analysis in the service of developing both LAK  and EDM fields.

INTRODUCTION  In education, the emergence of big data through new extensive  educational media, combined with advances in computation [1]  holds promise for improving learning processes in formal  education, and beyond as well. Increasingly, very large data sets  are available from students interactions with educational software  and online learning - among other sources - with public data  repositories supporting researchers in obtaining this data [2].   Two distinct research communities, Educational Data Mining  (EDM) and Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK), have  developed in response.    The first workshop on Educational Data Mining was held in 2005,  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This was followed by annual  workshops and, in 2008, the 1st International Conference on  Educational Data Mining, held in Montreal, Quebec. Annual  conferences on EDM were joined by the Journal of Educational  Data Mining, which published its first issue in 2009, with Kalina  Yacef as Editor. The first Handbook of Educational Data Mining  was published in 2010 [7]. In the summer of 2011, the  International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS)  (http://www.educationaldatamining.org/) was formed to promote   scientific research in the interdisciplinary field of educational data  mining, organizing the conferences and journal, and the free  open-access publication of conference and journal articles. The  EDM community brings together an inter-disciplinary community  of computer scientists, learning scientists, psychometricians, and  researchers from other traditions. A first review of research in  EDM was presented by Romero & Ventura [3], followed by a  theoretical model proposed by Baker & Yacef [4]. A very  comprehensive review of EDM research can be found in [6].    The Learning Analytics and Knowledge conference series was  initiated in early summer, 2010, with the development of global  steering and program committees (https://tekri.athabascau.ca/  analytics/node/5). The conference explicitly emphasized its role as  bridging the computer science and sociology/psychology of  learning in declaring that the technical, pedagogical, and social  domains must be brought into dialogue with each other to ensure  that interventions and organizational systems serve the needs of  all stakeholders. The first conference, held in Banff, Canada  attracted over 100 participants, with proceedings published in  ACM [5], validating interest in inter-disciplinary approaches to  analytics in learning. In summer of 2011, the Society for Learning  Analytics (SoLAR -- http://www.solaresearch.org/) was formed to  provide oversight for the conference, develop and advance a  research agenda in learning analytics, as well as advocate for, and  educate in the use of, analytics in learning.   With growing research interest in learning analytics and  educational data mining, as well as the rapid development of  software and analytics methods, it is important for researchers and  educators to recognize the unique attributes of each community.  While LAK and EDM share many attributes and have similar  goals and interests, they have distinct technological, ideological,  and methodological orientations. As schools, university, and  corporate learning and curriculum organizations begin to adopt  data mining and analytics, both LAK and EDM can benefit from  building off work occurring in the other community. This paper  details the overlap between these different communities and  discusses the benefits of increased communication and  collaboration.      2. SIMILARITIES BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES  The EDM and LAK communities are defined in relatively similar  ways. The International Educational Data Mining Society defines  EDM as follows: Educational Data Mining is an emerging  discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the  unique types of data that come from educational settings, and  using those methods to better understand students, and the settings  which they learn in.    The Society for Learning Analytics Research defines Learning  Analytics as:  the measurement, collection, analysis and      Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for   personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that  copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

EDM and LAK both reflect the emergence of data-intensive  approaches to education. In sectors such as government, health  care, and industry, data mining and analytics have become  increasingly prominent for gaining insight into organizational  activities. Drawing value from data in order to guide planning,  interventions, and decision-making is an important and  fundamental shift in how education systems function. LAK and  EDM share the goals of improving education by improving  assessment, how problems in education are understood, and how  interventions are planned and selected. Extensive use by  administrators, educators, and learners of the data produced  during the educational process raises the need for research-based  models and strategies. Both communities have the goal of  improving the quality of analysis of large-scale educational data,  to support both basic research and practice in education.      3. KEY DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES  The similarities between EDM and LAK suggest numerous areas  of research overlap. Additionally, the organizational deployment  of EDM and LAK requires similar data and researcher skill-sets.  However, these two communities have different roots and some  distinctions are important to note. Table 1 shows some of the key  differences between the communities. It is important to note that  these distinctions are meant to represent broad trends in the two  communities; many EDM researchers conduct research that could  be placed on the LAK side of each of these distinctions, and many  LAK researchers conduct research that could be placed on the  EDM side of these distinctions. By identifying these distinctions,  we hope to identify places where the two communities can learn  from each other, rather than defining the communities in an  exclusive fashion. Certainly, communities that grow organically  as these two communities have done will not have rigid edges  between what work appears in the two communities.    One key distinction is found in the type of discovery that is  prioritized. In both communities, research can be found that uses  automated discovery and research can be found that leverages  human judgment through visualization and other methods.  However, EDM has a considerably greater focus on automated  discovery, and LAK has a considerably greater focus on  leveraging human judgment. Even in research which combines  these two directions, this preference can be seen; EDM research  which leverages human judgment in many cases does so to  provide labels for classification, while LAK research which uses  automated discovery often does so in the service of informing  humans who make final decisions.    This difference is associated with another difference between the  two communities: the type of adaptation and personalization  typically supported by the two communities. In line with the  greater focus on automated discovery in EDM, EDM models are  more often used as the basis of automated adaptation, conducted  by a computer system such as an intelligent tutoring system. By  contrast, LAK models are more often designed to inform and  empower instructors and learners.    A third difference, and an important one, is the distinction  between holistic and reductionistic frameworks. It is much more  typical in EDM research to see research which reduces  phenomena to components and analyzing individual components   and relationships between them. The discovery with models  paradigm for EDM research discussed in [4] is a clear example of  this paradigm. By contrast, LAK researchers typically place a  stronger emphasis on attempting to understand systems as wholes,  in their full complexity. The debate between reductionist and  holistic paradigms has often paralyzed discussion between  education researchers from different camps; encouraging  discussion between EDM and LAK researchers is a key way to  prevent this common split from reducing what EDM and LAK  researchers can learn from one another.    Two other differences are in the most common origins and  methods of researchers in these two communities. Researchers  origins tend to drive the preferred approaches discussed above,  and these preferred approaches in turn drive preferred methods.  Greater detail on these issues is given in Table 1.

CALL FOR COMMUNICATION AND  COLLABORATION: EDM and LAK  There is a positive value to having different communities engaged  in how to exploit big data to improve education. In particular,  different standards and values for good research and important  research exist in each community, allowing creativity and  advancement that might not otherwise occur in a single,  monolithic research culture. For example, EDM researchers have  placed greater focus on issues of model generalizability (e.g.  multi-level cross-validation, replication across data sets). By  contrast, LAK researchers have placed greater focus on  addressing needs of multiple stakeholders with information drawn  from data. Each of these issues are important for the long-term  success of both fields, a key opportunity for the two communities  to learn from one another.    Friendly competition between the two communities will keep both  communities vigorous, and is generally beneficial for science.  This type of competition has occurred in the past, such as in the  split between the International Conference on the Learning  Sciences and the International Conference on Artificial  Intelligence in Education in 1992. Research networks are  increasingly global, as reflected by the multi-national executive  committees of IEDMS/EDM and SoLAR/LAK, but reflect  different nations to a significant degree. Hence, the existence of  both communities broadens the number of researchers working  and collaborating in the broader area of data-driven discovery in  education. At the same time, it is very important to keep  competition healthy. Healthy competition requires that both  communities disseminate their research to each other through their  respective conferences and journals to ensure awareness of  important ideas and advances occurring in the other community.  The two communities must communicate, in order to bring the  greatest possible benefits to educational practice and the science  of learning.       5. CONCLUSION  Given the overlaps in research interests, goals, and approaches  between the EDM and LAK communities, the authors of this  paper recommend that the executive committees of SoLAR and  IEDMS formalize approaches for dissemination of research and  enacting cross-community ties. A formal relationship will allow  each community to continue developing their specialized and  distinct research methods and tools, while simultaneously  increasing opportunities for collaborative research and sharing of  research findings between the communities.    This alliance would also strengthen our opportunities to influence  non-academic research and practice. A particular concern now  facing both EDM and LAK is the rapid development of analytics  and data mining tools by commercial organizations that do not  build off of either communitys expertise, algorithms, and  research results. To give one example, there is increasing  consensus in the EDM community that cross-validation needs to  be conducted at multiple levels (in particular the student level, but  also the classroom and lesson/unit levels). However, there is not   direct support for this goal in many of the data mining/analytics  tools now emerging. To the extent that EDM and LAK can jointly  articulate quality standards for research in this area, it may be  possible to more effectively communicate these standards to the  wider community of tool-developers and analytics practitioners,  as well as the broader research community. As such, both  communities would be facilitated in communicating their vision  for data-driven science and practice in the field of education.       Both the LAK and EDM communities anticipate that the impact  of data and analytics within education will be transformative at  primary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. An open,  transparent research environment is vital to driving forward this  important work. As connected, but distinct, research disciplines,  EDM and LAK can provide a strong voice and force for  excellence in research in this area, guiding policy makers,  administrators, educators, and curriculum developers, towards the  deployment of best practices in the upcoming era of data-driven  education.      6.
