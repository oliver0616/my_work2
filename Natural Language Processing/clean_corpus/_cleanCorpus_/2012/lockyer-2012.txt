This information might also facilitate post-delivery review and   reflection for faculty who wish to revise course design and   content.  But to be effective, this data needs to be appropriate to   the context or pedagogical intent of the course  this is where   learning analytics meets learning design.

BACKGROUND  The field of learning analytics is concerned with integrating the   big data sets available in the higher education context in order   to better understand student engagement, progression and   achievement.  Student information systems capture demographic   and academic background of students as well as their academic   plans and achievements.  Learning Management and library   systems capture aspects of students daily online academic (and   sometimes social) life  what resources they access, which   teachers and peers they interact with, which learning activities   they engage in, what assessment tasks they complete.   Traditionally, universities have used this data retrospectively    and often on an adhoc basis  to evaluate courses, consider   resource allocation, identify institutional performance issues.    The analysis tools and modeling being developed in the field of   learning analytics allows university educators and administrators   opportunities to draw upon this data in order to actively intervene   in the academic process and provide a tailored and more   personalized education experience for students.  For struggling   students, this might mean early identification and support that   has the potential to limit attrition.  Analytics that support   identification of high achieving students might allow universities   to provide options for further challenges and opportunities.     Numerous examples of the use of learning analytics to date have   focused on institutional use.  However, there is great potential in   learning analytics for faculty delivering individual courses.    These significant data sets and the tools and models to integrate   and analyse them may provide important information for faculty   to adapt a course and/or direct support to individual student or   groups of students during the academic semester.  Learning   analytics also provides additional and more sophisticated   information, then student satisfaction surveys, to help faculty   review and revise courses after the academic semester is   complete.   To be most useful for faculty during and post course delivery,   learning analytics need to match the teaching and learning intent   of the course.  The possible data is endless, but faculty will not   use endless amounts of data.  Specific, analyzed, and   appropriately presented data has the potential to be useful and   effective.  But what learning analytics are useful with what types   of courses  This is where learning analytics meets learning   design.   The field of learning design has developed for more than a   decade now as a way of documenting and sharing examples of   teaching and learning practice  particularly in higher education.1    Learning designs have been represented in various forms2,3 but   all essentially describe the sequence learning activities, resources   and supports that a faculty member constructs for students over   part of or the entire academic semester.  In essence, learning   designs capture teaching and learning intent.  And, they may be a   useful tool in attempting to identify the specific learning   analytics that might best support faculty based on that teaching   and learning intent.   This workshop bring the two fields of learning design and   learning analytics together as a way forward in establishing   useful analytic models for course delivery and review.   2.

ABOUT THE FACILITATORS  Professor Lori Lockyer teaches and researchers in educational   technology in the Faculty of Education at the University of   Wollongong in Australia.  Loris research and development work   has focused on how online technology can support teaching and   learning particularly to foster collaborative learning.   Over the   past decade Lori has been investigating how Learning Designs   can support university faculty to effectively integrate technology   into their teaching.   Dr Shane Dawson is the Director of Arts Instructional Support   and Information Technology at the University of British   Columbia. His research centres on the application of quantitative   data derived from student online activity to inform teaching and   learning practice. Shane's research demonstrates the use of   student online interaction and network data to provide lead   indicators of learning support, sense of community, course   satisfaction, learning dispositions and creative capacity.   Shane and Lori have been working with collaborators to   understand how social network analysis supports effective   teaching in higher education and are extending this work to   investigate the integration of learning analytics with learning   design.   4.
