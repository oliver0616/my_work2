As work   based education moves online so we see an increased use of what   is termed e-mentoring. In this paper we explore some of the   challenges of forming and supporting mentoring relationships   virtually, and we explore the solutions afforded by online social   learning and Web 2.0. Based on a conceptualization of learning   network theory derived from the literature and the qualitative   learning analytics, we propose that an e-mentoring relationships   is mediated by a connection with or through a person or learning   objects. We provide an example to illustrate how this might   work.

INTRODUCTION  The Open University (OU) is a UK based open and distance   learning provider. It has about 12,000 staff and around 200,000   students distributed across the world at any one time. Like any   large organization mentors play a vital role in the professional   development of individuals [11]. Mentoring is a social and   psychological relationship and typically takes place face to face,   where the value is seen to come from those personal interactions.   Those type of relationships present a key challenge to a   distributed organization like the OU, where students and staff are   not necessarily co-located. In an effort to develop a good online   or e-mentoring service, we started to investigate how to build up   and better support mentoring relationships using Web2.0   technology by creating a platform called SocialLearn (SL). This   paper proposes a framework and features that focus on how we   might employ transient connections (weak ties) within social   media to develop more meaningful (strong ties).   2. ONLINE SOCIAL LEARNING  Mentoring is a social relationship. Conole (2008) [5] noted that   the real opportunities that Web 2.0 affords is within online social   and situated learning. Online social and situated learning focus   on learning as social participation and shifting from an individual   and information focused learning to an online social learning and   communication/collaboration.  To foster these relationships   online social learning platforms should focus on social   interactions through activity streams, following and making   connections, to draw users towards content or learning objects.    This paper explores these social relations with reference to   mentoring.   3. MENTORING  Haggard, et al. (2011) [11] systematically reviewed the   mentoring literature between 1980 and 2009. They found over 40   different definitions for mentoring. In this section we explore   some of the ways that mentoring has been defined.   3.1 What is Mentoring  Classic mentoring features one to one relationships between a   more senior or experienced individual and a less senior less   experienced individual. Attempts to create a mentoring typology   often focus on formality (formal to informal) and structure   (professional competency to unstructured). However, while the   degree of formality is a factor, the relationships can be far more   complex than this, as it is a personal relationship [17]. Wong and   Premkumar (2007) [19] present three mentoring models: The   apprentice model, the competency model, and the reflective   model. In the apprentice model, akin to traditional     Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for  personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are  not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies  bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The different mentoring definitions and models invite us to think   about the different mentoring relationships and how the   mentoring theories relate to Web 2.0 pedagogies. Within online   social learning the focus is on learning by interactions and   connections with and through a person or a learning object which   is likely to be informal and unstructured. In addition to these   mentoring models that focus on the learning process, Haggard, et   al. (2011) [11] suggested that we must also consider a range of   other personal factors, such as gender, career stage, age   difference between mentor and mentee, etc. This suggests that   within any online mentoring1 relationship the ability to be able to   know something about another person is as important as what   they do. A persons profile on a social media sites help us   know the person. This suggests that we need to create   mechanisms that allow people to see others activity and view   aspects of their profile.    3.2 Mentoring Motivation  Wong and Premkumar (2007) [19] provided a mentor motivation   checklist to illustrate some of the reasons why people engage in   mentoring relationship, such as people like the feeling of   advising others, they find it satisfying, etc. It is interesting to see   that the motivations are associated with engaging in Web 2.0   communities and earning credit and reputation. For example,   generalized reciprocity [5] in online spaces is widely reported;   there is a suggestion that newcomers develop an obligation to   help others in the future through the valuable help and advice   they receive as newcomers [15]. Allen (2007) [2] found that in   addition to the simple motivations cited earlier more complex   psychosocial themes emerge. Perceived similarity is a factor  so   called similarity-attraction paradigm- where selection is based on   the overlaps in interests, Another important factor to consider is   mentor and mentee's performance where social exchange theory   drives mentor-mentee selection, with mentors choosing mentees   with strong performance, high ability and ample willingness -   with links to quality within social media and again the role of   the profile becomes important. Online social learning spaces   cannot account for all of these factors, but they inform our   thinking. For example, we can account for similarity, allowing   users to see a profile and judge similarity, and by using analytics   we can make recommendations, we can account for performance,   by creating criteria that allow users to display, view, rate and   evaluate other users through their profiles.    3.3 Shifting Sense of Mentoring  Our discussions above has shown that experience or   seniority is read in slightly different way between classic   mentoring and the mentoring in the online social learning   context. There is a flatter hierarchy in online mentoring than we   see in classic mentoring and this is considered to have benefits   in terms of student engagement retention and progression. The   importance of peer support in learning is also recognized in the                                                                 1 Online mentoring = e-mentoring   workplace. The informal social interaction around shared tasks   and challenges is now seen as a vital part of learning at work [9].    Discourses on e-mentoring also destabilize notions of classic   mentoring. The ability for mentoring to be relatively anonymous   and for mentors to be involved in multiple overlapping   relationships changes the relationship psychologically and   practically.  Alevizou (2010)s work  [1] on Web 2.0 argued that   the peer interaction and collaboration learning  fostered by Web   2.0 is a kind of  distributed online mentoring. These   opportunities are being realized by several companies that offer   secure mentoring services (e.g. Mentor Pro2), and open sites like   Horsemouth3. These sites offer a complex range of online   mentoring, from career, education, business, to secure services   for vulnerable adults and young people, and what might be more   accurately termed life coaching.   We need to account for classic mentoring. However, in Web   2.0 discussions on online mentoring is a diffuse relationship. It is   seen as part of the democratization of education where   communities support each other to create, understand and   share resources [6]. This means classic mentoring theories are   not enough to explain different types of e-mentoring relationships   that might evolve. We wanted to explore how the form of online   social networks informed the development closer relationships.     4. SOCIAL NETWORKING   Granovetter (1973) [10]s work on social ties explores the role   that weaker ties have within networks. Strong ties are those   things that bind groups (strong ties have overlapping network   and interests), while weak ties (casual contacts) allows us to   connect with other networks and open up new areas to explore.    Sites like LinkedIn4 and Academia.edu5 operate on this principal.   Haythornthwaite (2002) [12] investigated the relationship   between latent (he inactivated weak ties), weak and strong ties   and different communication media. She found that new   mediums of communication layered over existing ones can help   strengthen weak ties.  In addition, a new communication medium   can turn latent ties into weak ties. This suggests that online   social media can play a role in activating and strengthening ties.   Our reading of networks and ties is not one where networks and   ties only exist between individual, we recognize that they also   exist between what we call mediating objects (people, images,   groups, event posting, etc.). While people can and do connect   with each other, that connection is often mediated through a   mediating object [8]. Without these mediating objects it is   difficult for people to form connections [14].  Our imprint on   those objects helps us connect through the mediation objects   with other people and learning objects.  These social traces   help us make sense of the online world, and as we make sense of   it our tracks help others.   Returning to mentoring, the suggestion here is that an e-  mentoring relationship can be built up from a general connection                                                                 2   http://www.e-mentoring.org/   3  http://www.horsesmouth.co.uk/   4  http://www.linkedin.com/   5  http://www.academia.edu/   180    to a mediating object. The ability to connect with and through   rich content that Web 2.0 affords can play a role in developing   and maintain communities that support online mentoring [16].   We can activate those latent ties. If we then harness some of the   motivational cues identified earlier in mentoring, for example,   similarity or performance, then we may be able to turn some of   those weak ties into strong ties.    5. PILOT STUDY AND QUALITATIVE  ANALYSIS RESULTS   The data we draw on in this paper is from a six months pilot   study that looks at how, and what kinds of work based learning   SL can support. SL is a web2.0 online social learning platform   and tool kit developed by the OU.   Twelve members of staff occupying a range of positions   participated in the pilot.  Each participant attended a two-hour   initial workshop, which provided an introduction to the pilot   study and to SL and offered hands-on experience. Participants   activities on SL were screen captured using Camtasia software6.   During the sessions they were asked to narrate their journey.   Thematic analysis has been applied to the screen captures and   audio scripts. We used semi-structured interviews to explore the   theme analysis results in more details. Nine out of twelve   original participants were interviewed. The interviews were   transcribed and coded to identify dominant themes. The   qualitative thematic analysis was also employed for analyzing the   interview script. The qualitative analysis results show that whilst   the participants see SLs potential as: a complement to existing   work-based learning tools; a way of supporting flexible work-  based learning; a way of building learning networks; a way of   bringing resources together; a way of providing training and   support for staff and employees based in the regions and nations,   they also look for particular kind of mentoring functions to   support their online social learning.   Our wider reading and observations of e-mentoring systems   indicated that while our system could readily support   traditional mentoring, it also has the potential to support more   diffuse relationships that would support a sense of community   and generalized reciprocity. We found that confident social   media users were already doing this. During pilot they filled in   their profile and quickly began to establish connections, they   then used those connections to locate and make other   connections. What also became clear in the interviews (even   before the launch of Google+7) is that people wanted to be able   to differentiate between different types of connection.  This has   been found in informal work related online networks [18], and it   is our sense that this will be important in the workplace. Our   solution is to allow users to connect in different ways, for   example follow, and to be able to add tags that specify the type of   connection, for example adviser  or even mentor.    The use of the profile and activities to connect and make sense of   SL, along with issues raised in interviews highlighted the   importance of users profiles and making connections visible.                                                                 6  http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/   7  https://plus.google.com/#    This links with the similarity attraction paradigm in mentoring   and also touches on aspects of trust. Trust is important online   forums, as we often lack the normal cues that allow us to assess   whether to trust another person, or source of information.    Research on large online forums has found trust, or the cognitive   decisions we make around how credible a source is based on our   perception of how honest and reliable the source is, our sense of   what the intention is, and competence [3].  Online we use social   factors (rating and voting) to assess reliability, the users profile   and badges to demonstrate competence.   One of the key functions of any social site is the ability to   connect with others. We noted earlier the role that instant   messages sites like Twitter play in connections and establishing   ties.  While following is essentially a weak tie [4], coupled   with other channels of communication these weak ties can   become strong ties. While our early build did support   connections, the sense of sharing the space with others appeared   to be absent. It appears that users need to be able to see others   (through their activities), and be able to understand and interpret   what others were doing.  While this highlights the importance of   the profile and activity streams, it also asks us to consider how   we push content to users. In our framework (Figure 1) we   suggest that users connect with learning objects and people, and   through those they can in turn connect to other learning objects   and people  this is what they pull towards themselves.    However, it became apparent that users also wanted us to push   content and people to them.    6. BUILDING ONLINE MENTORING  THROUGH CONNECTION AND   RECOMMENDATION   In this section, we explore how connections are made with and   through mediating objects and how that informs the content we   push to (recommend to) users and the way users can pull   (search) content to themselves within the framework (Figure 1).   Following work on the role of learning objects in mediating   social interactions online [8], we extended the notion of networks   and connections from people to what we call  mediating  objects.   While we recognize that users will connect and interact with   learning objects and people in different ways, we consider these   ties are important, and just like our connections with other   people the strength of our ties will vary. This is important to our   understanding how people connect with and through people and   learning objects, and thus an important factor in understanding   how the people use connections in online social learning.   The framework indicates that users connect with other people   and content (key 1 and 2), as they build up those connections,   they leave traces that allow them and other users to connect   through to more people and content (key 3). Further, the users   connection behaviors through actions (key 4) will contribute to   develop recommendations for the users (key 5).   181       Figure 1: Connection and recommendation framework for   building online mentoring relationships in a social learning   environment      7. CONCLUSION  What we describe here is not classic mentoring, and we did not   aim to merely illustrate classic mentoring online. Instead we   took some of the key elements of mentoring and reflected through   social learning and Web 2.0. We found that many of the tension   and difficulties that arise in online mentoring relate to attempts   to see it only in relation to classic mentoring. Mentoring online   is ambiguous and opens to multiple interpretations [11]. Our   proposed online mentoring tools do account for classic   mentoring.  However, our main focus is the underlying psycho-  social factors and Web 2.0 connections. We have found a great   deal of common ground with research on social learning and Web   2.0. For example, the importance of performance criteria and   being able to select people based in similarity within mentoring   [2], is mirrored by the need to see and know about others online   [13] before developing connections and trust [3].  In this model of   mentoring (closer to peer mentoring or peer support in work-  based learning) the relationships are likely to be more diffuse   and feature connections that vary in frequency and intensity.    Here we drew on and developed the work of [10] on the strength   of weak ties (see also [12]). We know that these weak ties are   important in accessing new knowledge and information [10], and   that Web 2.0 tools (e.g. following in Twitter/Facebook) are   effective at creating networks of weak ties [4]. We explored this   in relation to people and learning objects [8], and the role that   ties played in developing a sense of place (for example [7] on   Twitter), and how that sense of commonality fostered   generalized reciprocity. Clearly this is only one of the ways   that users may develop online mentoring relationships. One to   one relationships or the allocation of mentors is far more   common in the workplace, and over the next few months we will   be developing those types of tools and pilot and evaluate the   updated specifications.    8.
