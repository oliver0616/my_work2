use interpretation inquiry conventions constructs tools philosophy reasonable approach science westerman proposed hermeneutics ideal philosophy inquiry brings meaning interpretation forefront explicit assumptions accounts must always refer people meaningful practices rather attempt fully explain meaning involved terms one arrive meaningful explanations phenomena westerman identified multiple

reaches limits accounting play creativity exploration computer hence employing abstractions gives meaning meaning portrayed may sufficiently representative phenomena study losing meaning reductionism another way assigning meaning phenomena reducing supposed fundamental components say definition something something made previously discussed linguistic operationalism prime example reductionism

sum frequency counts sheds light meaning psychological learning phenomena means call avoid inquiry involving quantitative analysis westerman explained key point even though mathematics enters picture
